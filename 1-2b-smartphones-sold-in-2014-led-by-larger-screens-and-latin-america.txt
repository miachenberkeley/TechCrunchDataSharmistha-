Apple isreaping the biggest rewards right nowwhen it comes to selling itssmartphonesand other devices, but the overall picture for the smartphone market in the year ahead may be a little less rosy.According to theanalysts at Germany-based GfK, in2014 there were 1.2 billion smartphonessold, up 23% on the year before and crossing the billion-unit point for the first time. But they predict sales will slow down to 14% growth in 2015, working out to total sales of 1.368 billion devices.The reason? More countries are reachingtheir smartphone saturation point, and so the industry is looking ever more for growth in two places: emerging markets where smartphone adoption is still atan early stage; and amongconsumersflocking to buying newer models with larger screens.Looking back on 2014, GfKs numbers speak to how a collectivepopulation of feature phone users  which were still the majority of sales at the start of the year shifted to becoming smartphone owners. Android tookmany of those newbies under its green wing.GfKs numbers are worth noting because the companytracks actual sales of devices from more than 90 markets. In contrast, companies like Strategy Analytics and IDCtrack shipments, and perhaps as a result, theirnumbers appear to come out a bit higher than GfKs.Kevin Walsh, a trends analyst directorwith GfK, says that coupled with the focus on emerging markets where consumers will be more price sensitive, pricing will continue to drop, too.We forecast emerging regions to drive growth in 2015 as smartphones further penetrate lower price points, he says. GfK forecasts that smartphone price bands above $150 will see a decline in their market share. At the next level down, $100-150, sales will remain stable, but it is the cheaper smartphones priced below this point that will gain share. GfK notes that every region except forNorth America and developed Asia Pacific markets like Japan and Koreasaw a decrease in the average selling pricein Q4 2014.Although prices may be shrinking, the screens are doing anything but that. Unit sales of smartphones with larger screens of 5 or more grew 180% in 2014 and will be the largest segment in 2015. No surprise that this trend is eating into the tablet market, too.SmartphonesUnits Sold (in mil.)Sales Value (in billion USD)FY 2013FY 2014% ChangeFY 2013FY 2014% ChangeLatin America68.7109.559%20.631.452%Central & Eastern Europe50.969.837%15.117.214%North America139.1177.628%58.271.823%Emerging APAC96.9149.955%22.328.427%Middle East & Africa99.8135.235%32.339.422%Western Europe115.4128.011%52.255.87%China Units359.0392.89%90.199.010%Developed APAC68.365.1-5%39.638.1-4%Total global units9981,22823%330.4381.115%Primary Source: GfK Smartphone sales based on point-of-sale (POS) tracking in 90+ marketsAs you can see in the table above, when it comes to which region saw the most growth in smartphone usage last year, Latin America saw the most active buyers, with sales up to nearly 110 million, a rise of 59%. Emerging Asia Pacific countries came a close second with 55% growth.At the other end of the spectrum is high volume but slower growth. In China, there were nearly 400 million smartphones sold  almost one-third of the global total  but the country isnow in the saturated market category, seeing growth of only 9% last year, with growth slowing to a flat standstill in Q4. Despite that, GfK notes that China will remain the biggest market in terms of both unit and value sales for the foreseeable future. Total sales of smartphones in Q4 in China wereup to$28 billion, a rise of 21 percent.SmartphonesUnits Sold (in mil.)Sales Value (in billion USD)Q4 2013Q4 2014% ChangeQ4 2013Q4 2014% ChangeLatin America25.136.043%7.29.937%Central & Eastern Europe16.721.529%4.55.112%North America43.657.031%18.425.136%Emerging APAC30.441.837%6.47.618%Middle East & Africa27.937.835%8.710.825%Western Europe35.140.014%15.617.210%China Units95.095.10%23.528.321%Developed APAC18.117.3-4%10.910.90%Total global units292.0346.519%95.3114.820%Primary Source: GfK Smartphone sales based on point-of-sale (POS) tracking in 90+ marketsLikewise, Japan and other developed Asia Pacific countries saw smartphone sales actually decline by 5% in 2014 (and down 4% in Q4 alone), due in part to changes in handset subsidies in Korea but also that continued issue of market saturation.North America appears to be the region with a happy medium: it had thelargest number of smartphones sold after China for the year, but also coupled that with above average growth of 28%.GfK didnt publish any numbers on which handset makers were doing well, and which were not. But we asked and theyve provided at least some platformdata  albeit incomplete: it left out all of North America and doesnt break out which Android makers are in the lead, and doesnt distinguish between iOS and any other non-Android platform.Still, for what it is, its a revealing picture of just how strong Android is in certain markets at the moment. As you can see, globally when you exclude North America, at the start of 2014, the majority of mobile sales were still feature phones, accounting for 68% of all sales. By Q4, Android held a 57% of all sales, while featurephones were just at 29%. Other smartphones, which are primarily iPhone devices, ended 2014 just as it started: with 14% of sales.Considering how much we talk about smartphones running the show today, its interesting to see just how powerful featurephones were at the start of 2014 in a number of other markets: they accounted for a majority of sales in every market in Q1, with India in the lead with 94% of all mobile sales going to feature phones. While other smartphones remained stable or declined slightly, Android hasbeen the platform seeing the most growth.AndroidOther smartphonesFeaturephones18146838125052123657142922215738194351183158212141680161470281161429492316613217514320375119302915566711228091175151024947588175782836913681278655993278814
