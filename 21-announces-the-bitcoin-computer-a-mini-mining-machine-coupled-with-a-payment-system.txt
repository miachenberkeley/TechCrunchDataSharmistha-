It is available for pre-order now on Amazon for $399. They also include a WiFi adapter and a 128GB SD card with a copy of the blockchain preinstalled.21.co is a secretive bitcoin company founded by Balaji S. Srinivasan. This is their first consumer product.The system allows you to buy and sell goods and mine bitcoin on a low-power 21 Bitcoin Chip.

It looks like 21s effort to release an entry-level and very usable Bitcoin miner for the rest of us. While its trivial to make your own BTC miner, adding the micropayment systems to the mix make things a lot more interesting. This is also a solid move by Srinivasan to prove that they are ready to rock and roll in the consumer space. Were expecting the company to start launching a chipset for mining bitcoin inside cellphones and the like but this is a nice start.
