So I know some of yall were worried about me after I agreed to have my face shaved at Disrupt NY to raise money for the Red Hook Initiative. I just wanted to check in and let you know what life post-beard is like.(Actually Im pretty sure none of yall gave a good goddamn, but Ill let you know anyway.)Initially, I went through the five stages of grief.Denial: I didnt believe that my fat face could be that jowly.Anger: That my follicles didnt put up more of afight.Bargaining:I asked if they could paste the beard hair back. They said no.Depression: Goddamn, that really is what my face looks like.Acceptance: That Dollar Shave Club and AOL(our corporate overlord) combined to put up $3,000 for the Red Hook Initiative  to match the $1,500 that came from so many ofthe TechCrunch friends and family (and my own friends and family all five of them).Have I changed? Im a little wiser (in that I will never do that again), and Ihave a newfound motivation to go back to the gym.Ultimately, though, this little experiment with my facemanaged to drive home a point that I know, but sometimes overlook. That our not-so-little community of makers, entrepreneurs and investors is pretty terrific.The money you raised is going to help an organization provide programs and long-term services thateach year reach more than 350 young people who live in a historically disenfranchised neighborhood. Another 2,000 Red Hook residents reap the benefits of the charitys work, as well.My face may be shorn, but yourgenerosity never fails to leave me beaming.
