500 Startups, the U.S. startup investor/accelerator with a reputation forbackingstartupsacrossthe world, is deepening its efforts in Asia with a new $10 million micro-fund for Thailand. The organization launcheda $10 million fund for Asia  500 Durians in 2013, but this new one 500 TukTuks, named after the iconic taxis pictured above  is dedicated toThailand, a country where there are fewVC firms.500 Startups declined to comment on the fund when we contacted the company, but TechCrunch has reviewed pitch documents providedto investorsand confirmed its existence withmultiple sources within Thailands startup community.The fund is not closed yet, but aformal announcement  including details of itsfirst investment(s)  is expected tobe made next month.500 Startups has already invested in more than eight Thai companiesvia 500 Durians, so now it is doubling down on the country. It plans to use halfof the500 TukTuks fund to invest in early-stage startups  that could potentially involve as many as 67 deals  with the other half allocated to follow-up and later-stage funding.According to documents, 500 TukTuks will provide an average of around $75,000 as a first investment, usually as part of a seed-stage round with other investors. The fund will cut checks of upwards of $150,000 for follow-on investments in startups that show signs of becoming big winners.The fund is being pitchedwitha general focus on startups that draw on inspiration from proven international and regional businessmodels and have thepotential togrow in Thailand, Southeast Asia and beyond.500 Startups is the highest profile investor to focus on Thailand to date, and itsfund ismanaged by two of the countrys most prominentstartup figures:Natavudh Moo Pungcharoenpong, CEO of Ookbee  a digital publishing startup that has raised over $8 million  and Ruangroj Krating Poonpol, a former U.S.-based Googler who runs Disrupt Universitya program to increase Thailands links with Silicon Valley and mentor young entrepreneurs  and is a director withTelenor. Khailee Ng, 500 Startups Southeast Asia-based managing partner, is involved as an advisor.TechCrunch understands that the 500 TukTuks team has pitched a range of prospective LPsfor its fund since December. That list spannedtraditional institutions, dedicatedstartup investors, high-profile business figures and private individuals, including Thailands former finance ministerKorn Chatikavanij pictured below meeting withPungcharoenpong andPoonpol.We believe the Thai market is hot, and were seeing liquidity avenues open up for startups in the region. This makes for a valuable opportunity for early-stage investing, 500 Startupswrote in its pitchtoinvestors.Thailand has traditionally been overlooked in favor of the more advanced economies of Singapore and Malaysia, and Indonesias 250 million population, but itis an interesting market for a number ofreasons.Its 65 million population is significant, while over40 millionare estimated to enjoy internet access thanks to the growing adoption of smartphones. Japan-based mobile service Line is the dominant social network in the country, its 35 million registered userbase beats even Facebook, such is the mobile-first focus of the internet. A number of startups  Ookbee included  have latched on to that potential, and the local ecosystem is growing quickly; 500 Startups claims domestic startups have raised $25 million over the past two years, up from practically nothingbefore then.All three domestic mobile operators run their own accelerator programs, co-working spaces have sprouted up across Bangkok and the rest of the country, and the local events scheduleis busy, yetthere are few investors. Indeed, the VC sceneis so nascent that Natavudhis one of the countrys most prolific seed-stage investors  having backed eight companies overthe past year alone despite his full-time role as CEO of Ookbee, which is valued at $70 million and probably Thailands most successfulstartup to date.500 Startups aimsto be an early moverin the Thai scene, which currently counts a clutch of angel investors, and dedicated funds from the likes ofInspire, Ardent Capital, CyberAgentand InVent/InTouch.The U.S. firmfirst madeconnections inThailand in2013, when its Geeks On A Planetour visitedBangkok as part ofits inaugural trip toSoutheast Asia. The tour returnedto Thailands capital city, alongside Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, last year and is likely to do so again this summer.Aside from its global fundsand 500 Durians, 500 Startups also has a dedicated fund/acceleratorfor Mexico  500 Luchadores  while it has ongoing plansfora fund forIndia. Beyond geographies, it focused on mobile startups with its newest $10 million Mobile Collective fund.
