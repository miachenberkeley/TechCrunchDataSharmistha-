The Nima was the hit of CES 2016. As a tiny gluten tester, it won our Hardware Battlefield and made an impression on the tech press. And the company today is announcing it has raised a $9.2 million round to expand beyond testing just for gluten. The company also announced today that it will rebrand from 6SensorLabs to the name of its first product, Nima.Foundry Group lead the round with participation from Upfront Ventures, SoftTech VC, SK Ventures, Lemnos Labs, Mitch Kapor and Matt Rogers, co-founder of Nest. Foundry Groups managing director Brad Feld will join Nimas board.At Nima, we envision a world where everyone is equipped with real-time data about their food to know exactly what theyre putting in their bodies, CEO Shireen Yates told TechCrunch. We are thrilled to keep expanding the capabilities of our technology to meet the growing demand for food transparency everywhere. This round of funding will fuel the R&D and production of sensors on the Nima platform that test for substances beyond gluten, such as peanut and milk.The company plans on using the influx of cash to accelerate the development and release of sensors that will detect peanuts and milk, allowing consumers to test food for hidden ingredients that the user could be allergic too. The companys first product tests for gluten, which is in its final phase of beta testing and should ship later this year.
