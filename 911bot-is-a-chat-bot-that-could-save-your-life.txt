When you find yourself in an emergency situation, its hard to know what to do. And even if you do, panic can take over.911bot, a product built at the Disrupt Hackathon here in New York, aims to help you out in a pinch.The Facebook Messenger-based chat bot lets you report emergencies to the authorities through a quick image-based interface. And as your report is sent through the system, it offers options to send extra information and media (like images and pictures) as well as directions on how you should handle the situation.For example, one of the most common reports is a traffic accident.If you report a traffic accident through 911bot, the system automatically calls 911 and files your request, complete with location information. However, it also lets you send video or pictures of the accident with important information on what you should and should not do.For instance, you should never move a person who has been in a car accident in case they have a spinal injury. This can cause more damage to their injury.Another common form of emergency is cardiac arrest. In this case, its crucial to take action quickly. 911bot sends over information on how to perform CPR. One of the founders explained to TechCrunch that, when CPR is administered within the first five minutes of an episode, the patient is 5x more likely to survive than when CPR is administered after the first five minutes of distress.This can mean the difference between life or death.911bot used the Facebook Messenger API, ESRI for location data, and Twilio to build out the system.If you want to learn more about 911bot, head over to the website right here.
