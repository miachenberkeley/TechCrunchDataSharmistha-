A Twitter account in the hands of a hothead startup founder can be a dangerous thing.The New York Times ran a piece Sunday looking into why a 62-year-old pillsawits price skyrocket from $13.50 to nearly $750 after it was acquired by Turing Pharmaceuticals last month.The increase in the price of Daraprim, a drug that the Times reported is the standard of care for treating a life-threatening parasitic infection, will undoubtedly have a major impact on those struggling to keep up with high prescription drug costs.The articlecontinued:Dr. Aberg of Mount Sinai said some hospitals will now find Daraprim too expensive to keep in stock, possibly resulting in treatment delays. She said that Mount Sinai was continuing to use the drug, but each use now required a special review.This seems to be all profit-driven for somebody, Dr. Aberg said, and I just think its a very dangerous process.It was apparent that the news regarding Daraprimwas setto stir up a storm for Turing Pharmaceuticals, which had already sent outa press release Thursday after a few other publications had dug into the price hike.In the statement,Turings Chief Commercial Officer Nancy Retzlaff reassuredthe public:Our number one priority is to ensure that all patients diagnosed with toxoplasmosis have an efficient and affordable means to access Daraprim, Ms. Retzlaff said. As soon as we learned that some hospitals and clinics were having trouble accessing the product, we developed an immediate corrective plan to ensure quick, efficient access for patients in need.Martin Shkreli, Turing Pharmaceuticals founder and chief executive, took to Twitter following the articles publication Sunday to do some of his own damage control.In the 15or so hours following the Times articles publication, Shkreli sent out 125+ tweets to the haters calling out his companysoperations.In a world where corporate public relations misstepsare met with highly manicured executive responses, its clear thatShkreli is not satisfied with letting the press releases do the talking.The former hedge fund managers responses to other Twitter users regarding the controversy were moreimmaturethan one could plausiblyexpect from a successful CEO, and painted apicture of a leaderwhois, atbest, incapable of speaking on behalf ofhis company effectively, and is, at worst, incapable of showing any sympathy to those struggling to affordhis companys life-savingdrugs.Its all painfully ironic for a guy who started a foundation earlier this year under his own name for helping out the underprivileged. The site starts reeking of hypocrisy when you weighthe foundations mission statement against the actual words Shkreli writesout on Twitter.Part of theShkreli Foundations mission statement:Founded in early 2015, the Shkreli Foundation isa non-profit charitable organization dedicated to helping people facing a variety of adversities.A tweet fromShkreli saying that patients debt resulting from the price hike aint my fault:Shkreli seems to believe that the ire of those calling him out comesfrom a place ofsocialist and liberal rage, rather than genuine frustration.@bp4Christtwitter isnt the best medium to do this on. it seems to be a great medium for socialist and liberal rage, though.The founder has a lot of choice words for random Twitter followers but it sounds like he believes that when it comes to responding to media criticism, Eminem lyrics and a physical gesture sum up his emotions a little bit more succinctly.#StayClassy
