Techstars has had a fast 3 years in Europe. After Techstars London, led by the departing Jon Bradford, had been set up, it opened a further three programmes: in Berlin, the Techstars Metro Accelerator (around retail) and a fintec accelerator sponsored by Barclays Bank.Techstars London Demo Day today saw over 1,000 people signed up (the majority of whom actually turned up to a rented East London cinema on a cold winters day) and featured speakers including Liam Casey (PCH International), Nicolas Brusson (BlaBlacar), Usman Haque (Umbrellium), Roland Lamb (Roli) and Mikkel Svane (Zendesk); as well as investors from Union Square Ventures, Wellington Partners, Balderton Capital and Index Ventures.Out of 1,000 applications from startups for this year, 10 companies made it through, consisting of founders from the UK, Middle East, Canada and the US  and even one from Kazakhstan.The batch also includes five companies led by previously successful entrepreneurs with the average age of the founders being 33 years old.Out of those that pitched, the chatter in the hall afterwards was mostly about Knyttan and Kimono (see below).Here is a quick rundown on the companies, and how they describe themselves.Bidvine
