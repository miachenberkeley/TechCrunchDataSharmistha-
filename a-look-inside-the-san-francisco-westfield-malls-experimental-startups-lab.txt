Silicon Valley is full of big, disruptive ideas. Now a certain mall in downtown San Francisco would like to capitalize on some of that innovative gold in the hopes that it will bring online shopping into the physical realm. So it built a tech space for startups.Bespoke is 35,000 square feet of co-working and event space with an open floor plan, comfy couches, startup offices, Rubiks cubes and a bouldering wall up on the fourth floor of San Franciscos Westfield Shopping Centre.The idea is that those hawking e-commerce goods will be able to offer those products for shoppers to see, touch, and test in the real world. Westfield hopes this might help it figure out what the future of shopping could look like at the mall.Some of the startups coworking, or participating in pop-up shops and other events include the product upvoting platform Product Hunt, crowdfunding site Indiegogo and personal shoe design startup Shoes of Prey. We took a peek inside on Bespokes opening day to find out more about this experiment in tech and shopping.
