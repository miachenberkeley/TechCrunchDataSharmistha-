A few years ago we wrote about something called a Kuratas, a robotic mech suit that allowed the wearer to fire a BB Gatling gun whenever they smile at their soon-to-be vanquished enemies. When it appeared in 2012 everyone thought it was a funny joke. Now its available on Amazon Japan for $1 million.The robot is obviously a bit hobbled  the powers that be dont want us going all Mechwarrior down at the local mall  so it moves about five miles per hour and you can buy the arms separately. Created as more of an art project/Otaku exciter, the Kuratas is a real, albeit expensive, thing and would be an excellent graduation or Bat Mitzvah present. I, for one, welcome our huge Japanese robotic mecha overlords.via Technabob
