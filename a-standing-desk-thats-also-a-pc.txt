Better still, you can accomplish all of that in a single product  which is precisely the sort of innovation one has come to expect from a computer accessory manufacturer that recently announceda case that looks like a luxury yacht.The DK-04 is a great big thingasfar as computer cases go though its pretty reasonable by desk standards, with a 47.2 by 29.5-inch surface area. That kind of space allows for a lot of components under the hood, including up to 10hard drives. With that kind of hardware, youre going to need some serious cooling, and the DK-04 has fans galore, which can be augmented with a liquid cooling kit.The desktop surface is made of temperedglass, so you can behold your computers guts while working, lifting up for easy access under the hood. Up front are four USB 3.0 ports, a disc drive bay and a dimmer for the optional LED lighting. Theres also a control panel on the left side that electronically adjusts the desks height up to 3.8 feet, so users can tower above their weak-willed seated co-workers.The DK-04 is set for sale on May 10 for $1,500.
