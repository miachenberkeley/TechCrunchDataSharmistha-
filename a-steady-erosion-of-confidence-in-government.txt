Editors note:Kevin Merritt is the founder and CEO ofSocrata, member of the new D7 DigitalGovernment Leadership Alliance a coalition of sevencompanies that focus on meeting the needs ofpublic-sector customers and influencers.Governmentsaround the world are facing significant political turmoil and enormous economicstress as they struggle with an alarming and unprecedented array of public-policy crises.And whether its water scarcity in Brazil, the rural electricity shortfall in India, the financial meltdown inRussia, or income inequality in the U.S., public-sectorleaders often seem overmatched and overwhelmed at a time when solutions andanswers are needed.To makematters worse, government officials are being challenged by citizen,business, media and employee stakeholders to address critical issues inoperations, governance and elections.Therepercussions from these issues  which include transparency, accountability,budgeting, spending, regulation and bureaucratic performance  have steadily erodedconfidence in public institutions and public officials.Theconsequences ofthese issues have also dampened citizen engagement and participation inactivities that are critical to the democratic process, such as dialogue,debate, voting and public service.At the same time, global societyis embracing brave new ideas and technologies at an unprecedented pace and scale. In many instances, these new ideas andtechnologies actually disrupt,without warning, existing and traditional governmentcommunicationchannels, regulations, policies and even laws. Consider therecent technology-driveninnovation and disruption from companies like Twitter, Apple,Amazon, Tesla, Coursera, Uber and Airbnb, for example.In addition, some governments arealso having a hard time keeping up with technology-drivencitizen mobilization because theylack state-of-the-art information infrastructure thatencompasses cloud data managementsystems, open data platforms, mobile applications,predictive analysis models, onlinevoting and consumer-friendly visualization techniques.The neteffect of all this is that democratic government organizations on just aboutevery continent are straining to keep up with the innovative progress that societyis making, and, as a result, theyre losing relevancy and legitimacy.The goodnews here is that a growing number of elected officials around the worldunderstand these corrosive issues, as well as the threat they represent; andtheyre confronting the problems with mission-critical digitalgovernmentleadership that will ultimately help solve pressing and painful societalproblems while transforming the public sector into an innovative leader for thenew economy of the 21stcentury.At itsheart, digital government leadershipis based on the very real and powerful idea that data is aninvaluable strategic asset and a critical new natural resource for government.Morespecifically, itincorporatesoperational data-driven solutions, as well as democratic process and governance systems.In technology terms, thismeans combining and deploying a host of critical, adaptive, effective andlower-costarchitectures,platforms, solutions, applications and services frommobile communications, cloudcomputing and software-as-a-service to open data, predictive analytics andonline voting.Finally,if its implemented and sustained effectively, digital government leadershiphas shown that it canachieve measurable and profound performance impact for governments when itcomes to citizen participation; transparency and accountability; data-drivenand evidence-based decision-making; service and program innovation; budget,spending and operational efficiency; revenue generation that doesnt includetax increases; and meaningful economic growth and development.Focusingon dollars and cents, a recent McKinsey analysissuggests that capturing the full potential ofgovernmentdigitization around the world could free up to $1 trillionannuallyin economic value through improved cost and operational performance.On a moremicro level, weve already seen a wide range of case studies that reveal thesignificant financial benefits that take place and take hold when governmentsadopt open data initiatives.SanFrancisco,for instance, reports that citizen access to real-timetransit data resulted in 21.7 percent fewer SF311 calls, which yielded a savings ofover $1 million a year. And in Texas,the comptrollers office used itstransparency website to save $4.8 million from more efficient administrationin the first two years after the site was launched.This helps explain why a recentGovernment Technologysurveyindicated that open data has become a top priority of CIOs in cities.Beyondjust zeroing-in on the cost side, public-sector leaders are seeking new ways toexpand prosperity in their communities today. And data-driven government isincreasingly appealing, because its proven that it can fuel private-sectorecosystem creation, as well as economic growth.The aggregate economic impactfromapplications based on open data across 27 of the European Union countries, forexample, is estimated to be 140 billion ($160 billion) annually. Spain isanother good case in point; itsinfomediary sector, which is made upsolelyof companies that sell services on top of open data, generates 330-550million ($370 million to $520 million) a year.Looking at this on a company-by-company basis, itsinteresting to note that firms like The Weather Channel and Garmin, which reuseopen meteorological and geographicaldata from the government,have grown15 percent moreper yearthan their counterparts in countries that price this information in order torecover costs. Another corporate growth story  this one fromZillow,the leading real estate information and home-related marketplace  alsohasalot to do with the fact that it uses government data, in this caseto helpfirst-time home buyers, low-income renters and senior citizens find homes.The next step is clear. Cities throughout the worldare instrumenting themselves with sensor-based technologies, and we now need toanalyze and utilize sensor-driven data to serve citizens better.Israeli public transport startup Moovit whichrecently raised $50 million in Series C funding and has anestimated 15 million users deploying its app to get around cities like SaoPaulo, Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Milan, New York and Los Angeles  fullyunderstands this. And so does one of its closest competitors, Citymapper,which hasraised $10 million and is concentrating on big cities like New York,London, Barcelona and Paris.Next-generation digital government leadership is also being driven bycompanies like Barcelona-based Scytl, which is helping public sectororganizations all over the world adopt election modernization, online votingande-governance solutions in order to increase the transparency, security,accessibility and efficiency of elections and plebiscites. Scytls business ismodernizing elections, but its mission is clearly increasing citizenengagement.AmazonWeb Services is another private-sector enterprise that will help boostdigital government leadership everywhere. And I say this because so muchgovernmentsoftware today is purchased and unused  the licenses arejustsitting on the shelf. But thanks to Amazons cloudtechnology, governments can now simply and cost-effectively pay for theirincreasing data usage as they broaden and deepen their digital presence.Over the past few decades, however,government has been losing face with people, and people have been losing faithwith government. But now, with the emergence and rise of digital governmentleadership, this broken contractcan finally be repaired and revived.Indeed, just as the right low-cost,high-touch and high-performance technologies have transformed the enterpriseand consumer marketplaces in recent years, these cutting-edge solutions can nowhelp government leaders aroundthe world confront and mitigate a portfolio ofproblems that have long blunted their effectiveness and tarnished theirreputations.Given the scope, sweep and severity ofthese problems, theres precious little time to waste. Digital governmentleadership represents an immediate and positive stepforward  no matter how perilous theplanet becomes.
