Sequoia also continues to invest with regularity at Series A and onwards in India, while SoftBank has entered the scene in a major way.

While handset shipments to India declined this past quarter for the first time ever  due toa pre-Christmas surplus  the projected growth of smartphones is giving founders and investorsoptimism that the market for internet and tech services will grow significantly. That, when coupled with a population of over 1.2 billion  many of whom are accessing the web for the first time spells opportunity.IDC reported that smartphone shipments reached23 million units in Q4 2014, up more than fourfoldon the same period two years previous. That growth is predictedto continue, in spite of the recent dip, andIndia is expected to overtake the U.S. to become the worlds second largest smartphone market with 200 million deviceowners by the end of next year.Even that figure would represent modest adoptionin the country, and it is likely to growth even further.
