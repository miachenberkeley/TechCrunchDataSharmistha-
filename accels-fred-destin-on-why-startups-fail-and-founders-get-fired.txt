Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Earlier in the week I caught up with Fred Destin, General Partner at Accel in London and one of the most prominent figures in the U.K. technology scene.In what turned out to be a pretty candid interview, we discussed a range of topics including the main reasons startups fail and founders get fired; how Fred analyzes the VC/Founder relationship (with what he calls founder intimacy); his experience as a board member and investor at rocketship, Deliveroo, and why most VCs are assholes.Destin also talked about his early days working at Atlas Venture in Boston, comparedthe US and European venture scenes, and discussed why he believes all business plans are poetry with the business model working well prior to investment being crucial.Photo credit: Jon Chomitz
