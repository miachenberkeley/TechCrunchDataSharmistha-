I think there is a real question here about responsibility for those who carry this information. Some of the social media companies operate arrangements for their own purposes under their codes of practice which cause them to close accounts sometimes because of whats carried. I think theres then a question about why not come forward. If its something that concerns terrorism or concerns child sex exploitation or some other appalling area of crime, then why would a company not come forward?Its a familiar refrainfrom the intelligence agencies. The notionthat big technology platforms have an ethical responsibility because of their reach and quantity of user data tohelpsecurity services combat terrorism and serious crime by doing more to passon information on their users  and ultimately, by implication, to eschew strong encryption to ensure continued access to user communications.Brits heard this point of viewagain this morning, fromAndrew Parker, the head of the MI5 domestic intelligence agency, who was giving alive broadcast interviewon BBC Radio 4s Today program  the first ever such live interview by a standing head of any of the U.K.s intelligence agencies.Parkers public turn on the airwavescomes at a time when the U.K. government is in the midst of overhaulingsurveillance legislation, withthe forthcomingInvestigatory Powers Bill due to be debated by MPs this autumn. So his appearance isclearly timed to apply pressure on thecoming debate.The governments previously stated priorities for the new legislation are plugging what it terms capability gaps in law enforcement and intelligence agencies abilities to combat terrorism and serious crime.Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedlyspoken out against strong encryption arguing it should always bepossible for intelligence agencies to access data in extremis.Like Cameron, Parkerlobbiedfor improved visibility, arguing more surveillance powers are neededas modern technology continues to evolve.If were to find and stop the people who mean us harm MI5 and others need to be able to navigate the Internet to find terrorist communication, we need to be able to use datasets where we can join the dots to be able to find and stop the terroristswho mean us harmbefore theyre able to bring plots to fruition, he said, adding:Its becoming more difficult to do it as technology changes faster and faster, and encryption comes in.As noted above, he also called specifically for moreco-operation from Internet companies  without specifically citing particular companies or specifically calling for encryption-perforatingbackdoors. Although the surface rhetoric is increasingly being framed as access vs encryption  so the political pressure againstconsumer services adopting strong encryptioncoming from the surveillance state is clear.I thinkthere is a real question about whether companies holding [communications] informationunder what arrangements they should come forwardto the authorities and share and report it, said Parker. But its only one of the issues in this realm where wider co-operation is needed too under legal warrant.Most of the time the question is if I know and have reason to believe who a terroristis, I know what communications means thatthey use, wehave a warrant signed by the Home Security to obtainit , the question then is can we actually obtain those communications from that company?Parker went on to argue that international agreement and arrangements areneeded to ensure domestic intelligence agencies can gain access to communications when the Internet companies in questionmight well be based overseas.I think it is important into the future that no only there is a framework of clearlaw in countries like Britain but also that there is international agreement and arrangements whereby companies have a confident basis on which to co-operate with agencieslike mine and with the police in order to protect society and of course their customers from people who might do them harm, he said.Theres plenty thats problematic with this argument if you view itasapush to formalize a requirement forInternet companies to act asoutsourcedstate intelligence-gathering apparatus. Spying should be the business ofspies, not social media companies surely? Although the drivebycommercial entitiesto gather vast amounts ofuser data to power their businesses has arguably got them into this tricky bind. If you cant see and/or dont retain userdata theres little point in the government knocking on your door asking for a backdoor key.Another key area the interview touched on was surveillance oversight.The U.K.s forthcoming Investigatory Powers Billis set to address oversight of surveillance powers  withexisting legislation in this areahavinghas been roundly condemned as lacking clarity and transparency. Several independent reviews of existing legislation, including QCDavid Andersons reportpublished thisJune, have also called for surveillance warrants to be signed off bythe judiciary, rather than (as is currently the case) by government ministers.Parker was asked specifically by the Today programs Mishal Husain whether MI5 would support a shift to judicial sign-off for intercept warrants  but he declined to give a view on this, saying it is for ministers to propose and parliament to decide.He also claimedMI5 does not have population-scale monitoring, saying rather it focuses resources on the people who mean us harm, adding: We are not about browsing through the private lives of citizens of this country.Which of course entirely sidesteps the core criticism ofmass surveillance (aka bulk interception)  since bulk interception does not discriminate in thedata that is gathered. Yetthe intelligence agencies claim they are discriminating in the data they choose to pull out ofthe dragnet. An argument that can be summed up as: trust us.Andersons reportdidsupportthe use of bulk interception by the U.K.s intelligence agencies. However he argued such expansive capabilities mustbe subject to strict additional safeguards  such as having judges sign off interception warrants. So only with an additional check and balance (judges) that is currently not there. Nor is ityet clear whether the U.K. government will followAndersons recommendation on this point.Without adequate oversight the security services trust us rings rather hollow  especially in light of the revelations of the extent of surveillance infrastructure disclosed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.Earlier this year, for instance, priordata-sharing activities betweenthe U.K.s GCHQ and the U.S.s NSA wereruled illegal by the court that oversees the U.K. security services  the first such ruling against the agencies in the courts 15 year history.The court has also confirmedGCHQ used its surveillance powers to spy on human rights organizations  including Amnesty International.Safe to say, there have been a lot of firsts since Snowden blew the whistle.On the other side of the coin, Parker claimed today there have been six terrorist attemptsin the U.K. which have been foiled by intervention fromthe intelligence agencies in the past 12 months. That is the highest number I can recall in my 32-year career. Certainly the highest number since 9/11, he said, going on to argue that digitaltechnologies have changed theshape of the terrorism threat.Because of the Internet and the way terrorists use social media  including from Syria  and the way we all live our lives with smartphones in our pockets, the terrorists do the same and theyre using secure apps and Internet communication to try to broadcast their message, and to incite and direct terrorism amongst people who live here, who are prepared to listen to their message, he added.If youre in the U.K.  or have access to BBC iPlayer  you can listen to the full interview with Parker here, for the next 29 days.
