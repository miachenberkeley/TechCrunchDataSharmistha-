aCommerce, the NTT Docomo-backed logistics and commerce fulfillment firm that servesSoutheast Asia, has raised $5 million as it prepares for an upcomingSeries B round that could exceed$30 million.The Bangkok-headquartered company, which provides backend tech and logistics for a range ofonline retailers, including Japanese messaging app Line, previously raised a $10.7 million Series A back in June 2014. This new injection of capital comes from existing backersArdent Capital, Indonesian conglomerate Sinarmas and Inspire Ventures.Logistics, like payments, is an area of focus for a number of tech companiesin Southeast Asia given the generally poor quality of infrastructure acrossthe region. Alibaba previously invested $249 million in SingPost to smooth outits operational network in Southeast Asia, while a number of commerce firms have raised significant sums of money  including Tokopedia, which took $100million from SoftBank and Sequoia  with a view to targeting the regions 600 million cumulative consumers.aCommerce had been expected to close its Series B round this summer, butGroup CEO and co-founder Paul Srivorakul told TechCrunch that the round has been deferred so the company can focus on execution.Were getting momentum so internal investors wanted to focus on growing the business in order to raise a bigger (Series B) round,heexplained.In particular, aCommerce said that its business in Indonesia has exceeded forecasts due to the rise in new players entering the e-commerce space. While the company didnt give specific names, retail conglomerateLippo Group is a prominent example, having poured $500 million into its upcoming MatahariMall business.Srivorakul said aCommerces regional revenue has increased by 700-800 percent over the past year, though he did not provide raw figures. With growth continuing, he said that giving the company more time will help it shape its business for a healthierSeries B round.Were thinking about how much value we can add over the next eight to nine months [before the Series B], he added. This additionaltime allows us to really execute.As and when it is time to raise,Srivorakul  who hasexited three startups, including Ensogo, which was bought by Living Social in 2011  expects that aCommerce will bringin more than$30 million in fresh capital. That would be notable by fundraising standards in Southeast Asia, but the company is building a regional business and is playing in the logistics and commerce space  all of which makesits business a capital-intensive one.Srivorakulsaid he and his executive team have been approached by many potential investors so, in addition to focusing on developing itsbusiness, aCommerce needs to select the rightinvestor team to take it forward.Note: The original version of this story pegged aCommerces upcoming round at $100 million; that has now been corrected to $30 million.
