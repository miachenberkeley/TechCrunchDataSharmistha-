Ben Maitland is the executive vice president of sales and marketing at MultiView.Forget about HuffPo or whats left of the surprisingly profitablesubscription dial-up unit: One of the primary reasonsVerizonbought AOL was for its ad tech business. The deal is avalidation ofprogrammatic advertising, but it also signals the end of programmatics startup era.Therevolution is now in the hands of tech/media conglomerates. That will likelymean a wave ofconsolidation among the various demand-side and data-management platforms, and the othervendors that populate ad tech; some will win, many will lose. But the dealsreal winners are marketers, because the morethings change, the more they staythe same.When AOL merged with Time Warner back in 2000, the idea wasto combine an early online network (and all of its underlying technology) witha media and advertising business.Arguably, that deal was agoodidea in theory, even though it failed.Today, one of the names has changedand the other has moved to the opposite side of the deal, but the combinationsbasic premise  that marketers demand synergy between network infrastructure,media, and advertising  remains as true today as it was back then. Whatsdifferent this time around isthat ad tech is finally ready for aninfrastructure company like Verizon to make the world boring, and by extension,functional.Marketing is rapidly becoming one of the most technology-dependentfunctions in business, a CTO and marketing analyst for Gartner wrote in aHarvard Business ReviewarticletitledThe Rise of the Chief MarketingTechnologist. In the most recentAccentureCMO Insights survey, 78 percent of marketers said they believe marketingwill undergo a fundamental changeover the next five years, becoming significantlymore focused on technology. And for the past few years, marketers have come toaccept as gospel, theGartnerprediction that CMOs willoutspend CIOs on technology by 2017.On the surface, Verizons acquisition of AOL looks like acontinuation of the trend toward tech-centric marketing. But is that reallywhat happens when an infrastructure company likeVerizon enters a space thathas been dominated by innovation and disruption for nearly two decades?Typically, the arrival of infrastructure offers the following benefits: consolidation; standardization; compatibility; and portability.Assuming Verizons competitors follow its lead into adtech  a safe assumption given the larger trend of telecoms moving into the mediabusiness  the industry will, soon enough, beginto resemble a maturing, stablebusiness, rather than the Wild West, as so many marketers describe ad techtoday.Consolidation will streamline the field of vendors into a moremanageable group, relieving marketers of the constant burden of vetting adtechs latest flavor of the month.Standardization will allow marketers tomake apples-to-apples comparisons when sourcing ad tech, as well as reduce thecost of switching. Compatibility and portability will foster more(and better)second-party data sharing andmore turnkey applications.Theres historic precedent for this. Commercial automobileproduction began in the late 19thcentury, but it wasnt until 1908that Henry Ford showed us a glimpse of a mature carindustry with the arrivalof the Model T. The telephone business took decades to go from Bells lab to anindispensable feature in every office and home, but it wasnt until the phonereached that level of infrastructure that every user was able to begin torealize the full potential of this powerful tool.In our lifetime, the personal computer wars of the 80s and90s may have been dominated by tech enthusiasts battling it out over standardsand protocols, but ultimately consumers gotinteroperability and portability.(When was the last time you heard someone complain they couldnt read yourdocument because you wrote it on a Windows computer and they have aMac?)Alongthe same lines, cellphone technology was a messy Wild West before the arrivalof the iPhone. Soon after Apple planted its mobile flag, the industryconsolidated andstandardized to the point where the most popular app companiesneed only make two versions (Android and iOS).More importantly, the appecosystem is a remarkable improvementover what it was five or six years ago,which is why smartphones are no longer tools reserved for techies and earlyadopters, but rather universal equipment for everyone.As ad tech evolves from the bleeding edge of innovation intoboring infrastructure, a lot of the tools and platforms we geek out over todaywill lose their appeal. That may sound likeheresy for an industry thatspent nearly two decades innovating at a dizzying pace. But for the marketerswho are increasingly at the center of ad tech, boring infrastructure is a goodthing.After all, marketers want people talking about their message, not thepipes that deliver that message. And while technology will play arole in what marketers do, dealslike this one mean that marketers can stopbeing procurement officers and get back to the creative art of marketing.
