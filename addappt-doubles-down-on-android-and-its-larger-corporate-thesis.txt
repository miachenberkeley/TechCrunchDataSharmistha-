The kids over at Addappt are back with a new build of their contact app for Android, so I snaggedMrinal Desai, a founder of the startup to dig into just what is new, why we might care, and where the companyis headed.The below builds off our last TechCrunch interview with Desai, trying to divinehow the app would grow on the Android platform. Now Desai is back to explain how that hoped-for growth translated. Heres how, and why the rubber met the road.(The interview has been condensed lightly, and edited for format.)For the non-users out there, what does the new Android version containthat is fresh compared to prior builds of Addappt?It is our biggest update yet since we made addappt available on Android ayear ago  it is completely redesigned from the ground up and with someexciting new functionality, which will especially be appreciated by Androidusers who have updated to Lollipop, full group support and more!Since we last spoke, how quickly has Addappt grown?Our presence on Android has been very meaningful and strategicallyimportant for us in helping us seed addappt in Asia, especially India.Addappt is also available in Simplified and Traditional Chinese.This has also led to some great conversations with a few operators andmanufacturers alike in India and other markets with similar characteristics.India is taking off for us comprising 40% of our Android sessions so far.It has also enabled new countries show up on strong on our radar likeRomania, for example.Where are you deploying more resources currently, iOS or Android?I would say we are now at 50/50 and this update will dictate how we moveahead.We recently also unbundled and released our one tapp messaging asan Apple Watch app (an update for that coming soon as well) and are veryexcited about the Watch OS 2 making apps native on the Watch  we seea lot of opportunity there too.Any plans to bring the code to new platforms?Being a small business with limited resources, we leverage it to beingfocused so we are not considering other platforms.But having said that, we are always willing to addappt.I presume that you are still not looking to raise external capital?Yes.We have remained self funded, frugal and done very well with how weallocate resources on demand. Fortunately thanks to some incrediblefolks, we have been able to tap into them on all our big releases like thiscurrent addappt 2.0 for Android. We added 2 fantastic interns from theComputer Science Department from the University of Washington just forthis and they thrilled us.Thank you again to Colin and Williams.Will the new Android version help Addappt grow more quickly?Yes but we focused this update to be more about functionality that makesaddappt a better standalone address book (i.e. without any friends usingit), an address book that would be a fantastic replacement for that providedby the Android phones.The group support (along with group email and group texting) andFavorites does not need any of your friends using addappt.)What can people expect from your company next?Our roadmap is very long including some compelling enough that we havefiled patents for them.In terms of expectations, you can be sure we intend to stay focused on theaddress book and stay true to its cause and our view of it.If TechCrunch readers have suggestions, we are always listening onhelp@addappt.com  we have real people on that email who actually listenand respond.In a year, how big is Addappt?We believe we have a long way to go and honestly couldnt say how big.Few strategic events can drastically change a trajectory.Jorge and I believe we have become big/ successful when we create anorganization that users and employees can trust  Trust that they will notbe tricked into spamming their contacts. Trust that their data is not beingsold.Trust that we have high ethical standards. Trust that we dont screwour employees.Users, investors and media should hold all organizations responsible for it.Some of our competitors use extremely unethical standards and it is alittle frustrating for us since it hurts us.In terms of users, it is a little too early to say but the early indications of thislaunch are very promising.Authors note: Desai originally included a changelog in his first answer. If you are into such things, the companys Google Play page contains similar information.Ill check back with Addappt in another six months to see how things are progressing.
