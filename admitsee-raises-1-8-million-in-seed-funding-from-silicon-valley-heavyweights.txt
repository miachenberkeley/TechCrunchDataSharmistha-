AdmitSee, a two-year-old, 10-person, San Francisco-based startup, has just finished raising$1.8 million in seed funding to take on pricey college admissions consultants.If things work out as planned, it could be taking on LinkedIn next.AdmitSee was founded in 2013 by former University of Pennsylvania classmates Lydia Fayal and Stephanie Shyu, whod observed  along with countless parents of U.S. schoolchildren  that the college acceptance process has seemingly grown more complicated by the year.Their solution? To launch what they call a peer-to-peer college admissions source. It pays college students to submit their successful college applications, then charges high school students (or, really, their parents) a higher fee to access those applications and hopefully learn how to replicate that success.Especially ambitious students can even pay a little extra to ask college students questions they might have about the whole process.AdmitSee wont say how many high school students have signed up for the service, but Fayal says that AdmitSee has managed to collect 50,000 application files for their platform, and that 1,000 students are currently available as mentors.As for pricing, Fayal says students who submit their successful applications are paid $10 up front and an additional $2 every time someone views their profile. Meanwhile, interested high schoolers pay $9 per week per mentor to get questions answered, a one-time fee of $20if they want a mentor to review theirpersonal essay, and another $75 per month to view the application files of students at five schools of their choosing.The many schools represented include Harvard, UC Berkeley, Cornell, Stanford, and Tufts.AdmitSeeorganized its offerings the way it hasbecauseusers typically try to find out as much information as they can about theirreach schoolsbefore potentially moving on to their so-called safety schools, says Fayal.In fact, AdmitSee is discoveringmore trends all the time from the information thats accruing to its platform, Fayalinsists. For example, shesays that Columbia and Cornell seem to take similar people, whereas other schools, including Yale and Brown, similarly see a lot of overlap. Fayal says AdmitSee can help C students understand which better schools might be more forgiving of their grades. (These include Tulane, the University of Maryland, and University of Michigan, she says.) Based on the companys learnings, it also makesa difference wherea high school student applies for early admission. (According to Fayal, New York University accepts more early-admissions students than Columbia.)Going forward, says Fayal, AdmitSee hopes to replicate its own burgeoning success with a product that helps undergraduate students get into graduate school, and a thirdproduct that willeventually helpboth undergrads and grad students find jobs at the companies where they want to work.Indeed, a lead-gen business seems to be in the works.Were not doing it yet, says Fayal, but part of our plan next year will be focused on working with law schools and business schools that are maybe lower in the rankings and want some help in filling seats and making people more aware of their existence.In the meantime, AdmitSeewill be using its new convertible note fromSocial + Capital Partnership, FOUNDER.org, and Imagine K12s Start Fund(which includesNew Schools Venture Fund, GSV Capital, Y Combinators Paul Graham, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, and Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig)  to grow awareness about its brand, convince parents of its value, and start hiring some salespeople.Says Fayal, We just hired our very first designer this past week. Thats an exciting start.
