Adobe announced a number of new products at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today that will expand the companys set of mobile core services in its Marketing Cloud and make it easier for enterprises to manage content for their mobile apps.Adobes Experience Manager, its enterprise tool for building content-rich sites, is getting the biggest update today.The company is introducing Adobe Experience Manager Mobile, an additional version of the Experience Manager tool that will allow enterprises to build and manage mobile apps for iOS, Android and Windows that plug into their existing enterprise content management systems. Using the tool, anybody inside a company can build a template for a basic content-driven mobile app and then connect it to the companys data sources.With Experience Manager Mobile, the company is essentially combining the capabilities of its existing  and rather developer-centric  Experience Manger Apps and its more designer-focused Digital Publishing Solution.Adobe argues that for most companies the problem isnt so much building apps but maintaining them and keeping them updated.Experience Manger Mobile works somewhat similarly to some of Adobes other designer-centric tools like Muse  but the focus here is more onbuilding templates and connecting them to data than on designing a single HTML site. Experience Manager Mobileuses a grid-based design tool thats similar to the likes of Muse, but instead of writing static content for the app, designers can then add cards that can be hooked up to an enterprises data sources.All of this is then also integrated directly with Adobes Marketing Cloud, so businesses can see exactly how well their apps are actually performing and integrate them with this existing marketing solutions.For now, Adobe only supports its own analytics suite for this and that probably wont change anytime soon. The company says its aim here is to make integrating analytics as easy as possible for its users. With this solution, they only have to enterthe address for their analytics report into the service once and from then on, everything that happens in the app gets fired off to analytics automatically.On the technical side, apps built with Experience Manager Mobile can be extended using a combination of Cordova pluginsand the Experience Manager Mobile API to connect them to business systems.Experience Manager Mobile, as well as Adobes other marketing tools, will now also benefit from a number of additional mobile core services that aim to give developers more marketing options.The new mobile experience enhancements, for example, enable developers to leverage location-based personalization. Maybe you want to send a message to those customers who have installed your app and are in the vicinity of your stores, for example. Until now, that wasnt really an option for Marketing Cloud users, but its now pretty straightforward to integrate.Also new in these core services for the Marketing Cloud is the ability to integrate deep linking into apps. Too often, after all, links from the web to an app still drop you into the app homepage.Maybe the most important update here, though, is improved support for mobile push and in-app messaging. Adobe is moving to a unified messaging platform for all of its Marketing Cloud products that should make it easier for brands tosend deep links via push messages.
