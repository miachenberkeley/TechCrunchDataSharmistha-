Adobe Lightroom mobile is one of the first attempts at bringing some of the more recent Adobe releases on iOS to Android  and its available now with compatibility for a range of devices spanning Jellybean to Lollipop. The Lightroom mobile experience on Android is optimized for smartphones, though itll also work serviceably on tablets, and its available for anyone with Lightroom 5 and a Creative Cloud subscription that includes access to Lightroom on the desktop.Like its iOS counterpart, it allows uses to sync collections from their desktop Lightroom 5 libraries, using Creative Cloud to handle file change syncing and updating across collections. You enter your Adobe ID to get started on the mobile app, and adjustments you make on your Android device via the Lightroom software automatically flow back to your desktop installation. On mobile you can import photos from your Android device photo gallery, and these, too, are synced up with your desktop collections.Lightroom is designed for more convenient, easier access to quick features and adjustments, and as such it contains a range of presets and standard crops to make things easier for manipulation via touch on smaller screens. Crop can be set by predefined aspect ratios, or manually adjusted via touch. All photos in the collection can be flagged as picks, just like on the desktop, or assigned star rankings for more granular differentiation.Via Android you can share to other apps on your phone, or via email, Bluetooth and more depending on your devices capabilities. You can share links to collections for anyone to check out entire galleries on Lightrooms web-based application as well.The Lightroom mobile Android app is actually pretty generous in terms of requirements  it supports Android 4.1.x and up, works with any quad-core CPU using ARMv7 architecture with 1.7GHz or higher, plus 1GB of RAM and just 8GB of onboard storage, though Adobe recommends higher specs for optimal performance.
