Affirm has madeit no secret that its success will hingeon its ability to offer customers a wide range of retail partners where they can frequently use Affirm to pay.While the lending startup originally launchedwith niche partners like Casper mattresses and Boosted Boards, they have expanded partnerships to over 700 retail merchantswith the hopes of tempting a more diverse range of shoppers to try the service.But today at ShoptalkAffirm announced they are partnering with Expedia and Eventbrite to offer 3-, 6-, or 12-month payment plans to customers buying intangible experiences like a vacation or concert ticket.On the surface, the benefits for both sides are clear. Affirm gets a large, pre-existing customer base with whom it can offer financing, and Expedia and Eventbrite get to offer their customers a new payment option, whichAffirm says typically leads to increased sales performance by retailers.But are one-time experiences really something consumers should finance? The answer is probably that it depends on when the actual experience is in relation to when you made the purchase.For instance, it would be nice to pay over six months before you fly to that exotic country youve always been dying to visit. But on the other hand, who wants to be stuck paying for sixmonthsafteryouve experienced the trip?Financing experiences also raises the question of whether or not shoppers will still repay Affirm after they already went on a vacation. With a tangible good, you continue to gain utility every day for months or even years after youve repaid the company. But with a vacation, shoppers may be more likely toleaveAffirm on the hook for the balance of the trip when they are still paying a year after theexperiencethey now barely remember.The companys response tothis is that they will be treating travel and ticketing the same way as material goods, and still will use thousands of data points to assess a consumers ability to repay. And, if repayment trends do change, they will adjust their modelsaccordingly to ensure theyapprove consumers in ways that maximize repayment rates.As weve discussed before, high-interest rate financing plans like the ones offered by Affirmcan be a sticky situation. On one hand, there isa risk of customers using the service irresponsiblyto finance nonessential items that they cant afford.But, if used responsibly,Affirmcan empower consumersto stretch their dollar  so they dont have to settle for goods or experiences that they dont really want, but are the only thing they can immediately afford.
