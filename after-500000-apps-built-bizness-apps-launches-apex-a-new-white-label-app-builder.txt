Founded in 2010 as a DIY app and website development platform, Bizness Appshas quietlyturned its attention to resellers and digital agencies, becoming one of the largestproviders of white-label app development software on the market.In fact, over 500,000 total mobile apps have now been created using the companys software, and they account for five percent of all apps in the iTunes App Store.Now, the company is launching Apex, a complete rebuild of their app builder platform. The new platform was built with the goal of shortening total development time, and will combinedesign, app building, and marketing all into one web-based platform.Essentially, Apex contains everything someone a web professional needs to quickly build interactive apps for clients.While this sounds great in theory, most existing mobile app development kits are just good at making front-end apps without much interactionessentially a website clone.Lucky, Apex bucks the trend by allowingbuilders to easily add interactive modules like loyalty programs,ordering systems, and deep location-aware features features. The platform also allows builders to customize the look and feel of their app, all the way down to specific fonts and colors.Apex also handlessubmission of the app to both iOS and Android app stores, as well as offers builders post-approval featureslike push notifications and engagement tracking.By shifting its attention from websites to apps, the company is making a big bet that apps will equal or overtake websites as the main way to reach customers. However, this seems to be a safe bet, as Google has already started showing app-only content in its search results.Ultimately,platforms like Apexare a net positive for consumers and developers, as they shorten development time whileencourage more small businesses to make the jump toapps, while ensuring that the apps will actually offer more features than a businesssstatic website.
