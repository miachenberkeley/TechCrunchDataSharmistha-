Some startups raise a lot of money with much fanfare before theyve ever shipped a product, butsome grow under the radar, building something that clicks, and then slowly amassing users and revenues before most even realise theyve arrived.Now, oneof the latter  an education startup called Age of Learning has movedinto the billion dollar valuation club on the strength ofonehighly-grossing, popular app calledABCmouse. The companyhas quietly raised$150 million at a $1 billion valuation from Iconiq Capital, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed.Iconiq itself is a somewhat quiet affair, too. Part investment fund and part family office for the likes of theZuckerbergs, Sheryl Sandberg, Reid Hofmann and Jack Dorsey, the company does not make much of a song and dance about its investments and other activities. In this case, Will Griffith, a partner at Iconiq and a board member at Age of Learning, also confirmed the investment in an email to me after we asked about it.Perhapsbecause education tends not to be as flashyother areas of tech, and perhapsbecause Age of Learninghas not been in the business of talkingupits investors and other milestones that usually form the path of mainstream and tech media coverage, Age of Learninghas largely remained out of the limelight compared to some of its peers in the world of successful apps.But ABCmouse has cornered its market. For the last year and a half, it has consistently stayed in the very top ranks as most downloaded and highest grossingeducational and kids apps. From what we understand, the app has annualrevenues ofover $100 million, and thebusiness is profitable. (And although we heard that its raising more money, apparently this is not on the cards.)Whats interesting is the targeted approach the company has taken. ABCmouseonly offerscontent forchildren between two and seven years of age, soon to be two and eight (that is recent: it used to be just 2-6). It iscurrently active in only two markets, its home base of the U.S., and more recently China.Butas it grows, and with the kind of funding its raising, my guess is that Age of Learning islikely to expand in both age range and geography.Age of Learning is an extremely innovative education first technology company, said Griffith. We are thrilled to partner with them in their unparalleled commitment to creating the highest quality early learning curriculum and support their continued success in improving educational outcomes for kids around the world.All together, thecompany hasoverone million subscribing families. It says millions of children useABCmousein-home through paid subscriptions $7.95/month for unlimited access to 7,000+ activities and 3 unique child profiles. Schools, libraries, Head Start programs, and community centers can use the appfree of charge.Founded around2007 by Doug Dohring  a serial entrepreneur who had previously startedandsold Neopets to Viacom in 2005 (Viacom then sold it on in 2014 to JumpStart)  Age of Learning had previously raised around $30 million in 2011 and 2012 from an undisclosed group of investors before its round with Iconiq.Its history up to now is an example of how tech companies do not need to follow a specific pattern of moving fast and breaking things, but rather doing what works for aparticular product.In its case, although Glendale, CA-based Age of Learninghas been around for nearly a decade, it started slow, spending nearlyfour years building thingsbefore launching itsproducts, first for families in 2010, then adding tools for teachers in 2011.Age of Learnings growth spurt appears to have happened around 2013-2014, when it consolidatedsome 20 different apps into a single flagship product filled with lots of different subjects, now some 7,000 activities in all.(When you think about it, this is in contrast with others like Facebook, which runs several strong app brands, but its a route that works in ABCmouses specific patch: its the same strategyfollowed by other educational publishers like language app makerMonkimun.)It looks also like some recategorizingof the app in November 2014 also played into the apps favor.While ABCmousesaudience and approach aretargeted, the offering is actually pretty vast, like an ever-expanding book: ABCmouse now hasover 7,000 learning activitiesthat includereading and language arts, math, science, social studies, health, art, and music, with development steered by a board that includes teachers, academics and others, and several awards to its credit.And while publishers in categories like games are always trying to figure out what will be their next big hit, spinning more appsout of their development factories in pursuit of this goal, it seems there areno plans to return to anarrayof different apps outside of the flagship app.Were focused on continuing to expand ABCmouse, Zac Katz, SVP of corporatedevelopment at Age of Learning, told TechCrunch.
