For example, if theres a conference in San Francisco, it will suggest the room owner to raise the prices of their listings.Its oftenlooking at hotels in the area, seeing how much they charge, Curtis said. Inlot of cases its someone typing in a number and hoping for the best. Its one of the biggest pointsof friction in the startup process, andworse than knowing what to price is understanding how that price should evolve over time.Airbnb also released a tool that allows users to send gift cards, which is also available today.
