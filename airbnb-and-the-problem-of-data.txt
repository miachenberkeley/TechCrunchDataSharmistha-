Housing activists, San Francisco policy makers and Airbnb are in the midst of anothershowdown over short-term rental regulation that will stretch into next month and potentially into the November election. The debatecenters onenforcement, data and caps on the number of days a host can put aunit out onaplatform.If a new set of rulesisntformalized soon,the battle will headto the ballot. That would mean that voters will getto decide on how they want to manageshort-term rentals in San Francisco, which is in the midst of one of the worst housing shortages in the citys history.Ifregulationgoes to the ballot on a citizens initiative, that will mean that the citys ruleswill bemoreinflexible than they would beif a billpassed through the normal legislative process,since amendmentswill have to be ratified by thevoting public.Ultimately, how San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and other economically prosperousand land-constrained cities decide to regulate Airbnb willimpact how much the company can grow its inventory initsmost lucrative markets. WhileLos Angeles city council members are currentlyconsidering new rules, New York Mayor Bill de Blasios administrationdoes not yet have a position onshort-term rentals.In any case, all of these discussions mayaffect how much the company is worthin an eventual IPO.CEO Brian Chesky said last month that the company is on track to host 1 million guests per night. With more than 1.2 million rooms onitsplatform, Airbnbsinventory is now larger than branded chain hotels likeIntercontinental,Marriott and Hilton. If it was successful in raisingadditional funding at a $20 billion valuation as we and Bloomberg have reported, that implies that its latest investors are probablybetting on a 2 or 3X return or more.Thekey questions here are:Capson a maximum number of days:A huge point of debateis whether thereshould be a cap on the number of days a unit can be rented out. Thesuggestednumbers range from 60 days in supervisor David Campos proposal to 75 days in the November ballot initiative to 120 days in thelegislation backed by Mayor Ed Lee.Itsincredibly hard to identify an appropriate cap. All of the studies  from the San Francisco Planning Department, the legislative analysts office and the city economist  operate off of website scrapes anddata subpoenaed by othergovernments, because Airbnb and the other hosting platforms do notshare aggregate, anonymized data with the city government. The other platforms like Homeawaydont collect this data because their revenue model isntbased on bookings.Airbnb discloseda select amount of data on Monday about the 9,692 units that were listed from Mayof last year until Aprilon the platform. They arguedthat a personwould need to rent out a room for 211 days to make it more lucrative than taking on a long-term tenant and that only 6 percent of their listings crossed that threshold.But itsproblematic to price breakeven rates off of market-rate rents, because only 10 percent of the citys housing stock is market-rate. Almost half of the citys housing units arerent-controlled and then another third are owner-occupied. As such, its notclearwhat people are paying and when the financial difference between what a landlordcould earn on Airbnb is strong enough to forgo renting out an extra bedroomor even to try and illegally evict a tenant.The city hasnt studied the demographic composition of the rent-controlled stock in more than a decade, as there are concerns from tenants groups about how the data would be politicized. (Yes, the needfor data goesmanyways.)One study from the legislative analysts office, commissioned by Supervisor David Campos, estimated that between 925 and 1,960 units citywide were removed from the housing marketthroughAirbnb listings. A separate subpoena on New York City by the states attorney generallast year found that six percent of the citys hosts were generating 37 percent of therevenues and that 38percent of total revenues in 2013 were going to hosts who rented their units out for more than half of theyear.The concern here is that a long tail of casual hosts is concealingthe fat head of Airbnbsprofitability with more permanentoperators, whomay beremoving housing units from supply. There is a whole cottage industry of professional Airbnb managers, including Pillow Homes, which just raised $2.7 million in Januaryand offers a guaranteed monthly income stream to its hosts.San Franciscoscity economist Ted Egan acknowledged that is impossible to how many units, if any, are taken out of the citys permanent residential housing stock without accurate data. Still, in a separate report, he argued that all of the proposed caps are more than conservative enoughto protect housing. His breakeven calculations ranged from123 days a year in Russian Hill to 241 days a year in the Inner Sunset.Because Airbnb launched a pricing recommendation algorithm last week, you can actually check the hypothetical breakeven rate on your own space. The recommendedpriceson my own personal bedroom in a shared flathavefluctuated from $90 to $160 per night. So the annualized breakeven rateon my room issometimesbelowSupervisor Mark Farrells suggested 120-day cap, and is sometimesa month or more higher.(Im a frequent Airbnb guest, butI do not host because Im a tenant and the current city laws around short-term rentals do not supersede existing tenant-landlord agreements. Because most tenant agreements do not explicitly mention short-term rentals, the citys legislation in practice is probably more favorable to landlords.)Airbnb responded to my point, saying thatevicting tenants to use a unit for short-term rentals is illegal. But in practice, its difficult to identify and then penalize these cases when they happen. For example,city attorney Dennis Herrera settled a $276,000 case last month with two landlords who had put their unit on VRBO and Homeawayafterevicting a disabled tenant. But it took six yearsfrom the timethe defendantsstarted listing the unit in 2009 to get the case settled. Thats because enforcement is complaints driven, rather than automatically matched by unit to Ellis Act eviction or property records.Iterative regulation anddata transparency:The data problem speaks to a larger issueas technology companies facilitate more and more online-to-offline behavior, which at scalestartsto impact public systems. In Los Angeles, driving appWazebecame so popular that it began moving large flows of traffic through side streets and residential neighborhoods instead of main thoroughfares and highways.Waze, which has a lot less to lose than Airbnb,chose to share aggregate, anonymizeddriver data with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcettis administration to design bettertrafficflows. Of course, you might argue thatroads are public infrastructure while mosthousing is privately owned. However, the practice of residential zoning has been upheld at the U.S. Supreme Court level for almost a century.Supervisor Jane Kim, who represents the Tenderloin and Central SOMA, hinted that the city policy makersmight push for more data down the lineat TuesdaysBoard of Supervisors meeting.She said:I dont think theres an equivalent between the example that I brought up about sharing peoples private emails and the content of thatemail to sharing the number ofnights that a host rents out toa tourist is the equivalent type of data sharing. That being said, if we as a city government are going todive in to that policy area ofdata sharing, I would feel more comfortable knowing that we had a larger policy discussion in the long-term about when we dothat and when we dont, so we set parameters to make sure we are really protecting the valid privacy and security rights of our residents.These are not ideas that onlyregulators or politicians are talking about. Technologists are discussing them too.Nick Grossman of UnionSquare Ventures, the high-profile East Coast venture firm that has backed Twitter,Kickstarter and SoundCloud,penned a series of essays onwhat he callsRegulation 2.0.Grossman says that is:The idea that, given the huge volume of real-time data produced by modern web services and the potential for radical transparency based on that, there is an opportunity to explore completely new regulatory approaches. Approaches that, rather than make up-front decisions about an activity (say, ride-sharing or peer-to-peer apartment renting), as we do in a 1.0 regulatory regime, we can instead be more permissive on the front-end, while at the same time introducing increased accountability through transparency.At its core, Airbnbisa form of regulatory arbitrage betweenhotel and permanent residential zoning. It takes one kind of physical space, previously availableonly to one kind of demand  permanent residential demand  and makes it efficiently available to an additional type of short-term or itinerantdemand, which potentiallyresets the housing stock at a higher equilibrium price at scale. While there are many larger underlying contributors to the housing shortage in San Francisco, it is possible thatAirbnb adds stress on the margins.But we wouldnt know that without data.While Ive written extensively on how the region has underbuilt housing relative to population growth and urbanization, it has also underbuilt hotel space. Hotel occupancyrates in San Francisco have actuallyincreasedeven despiteAirbnbs growth.Thats whyhotels havent been visiblepoliticalopponents tothe company.San Francisco city hotel occupancy rates and tax revenues continue to rise even with the emergence of Airbnb and other hosting platforms.But unlike hotel zoning, where the city allocates set heights and densities and developersbuild hotels on fixed pieces of land, short-term rental inventoryfluctuates.Cities need to understand whether short-term rental inventory is expanding faster than they can produce housing stock and whether thatis impacting the availability of housing to long-term residents. Putanother way: you would not A/B testchanges to a software platform or interface without data, so why would you ask city policy makers to A/B test regulatorychanges in the dark when it comesto the platform of their finitephysical space?I know that the counter-argument isthat the city should just build more housing. But itis building housing at the fastest pace in two decades, along with pushing for a $300 million affordable housing bond and creating subsidies formiddle-class housing for the first time in its history.Evenif the San FranciscoBay Area had aspermissive an entitlement process as Houston, which was approvingmore units than the entire state of California in certain quarters last year, it is just easier toputan existing housing unit ontoa short-term rental website than it is to go through the motions of building an entirely new unit by raising capital, acquiring land, hiringan architect, going through the entitlement process, addressing environmental impacts, hiring construction workers and marketing and selling the units. The developer who did the Vara project at 15th and Mission told me earlier this week that its about $650,000 in raw costs per new housing unit at this point in the economic cycle.On top of that, there are many ways in which Airbnb andmunicipal governments are just not fundamentally aligned. Whilethe identity, reputation and review systems of a hosting platform can supplant some of thegovernmentallicensingmeantfor safety,Airbnb is a privately held, for-profit company thatis incentivized tomaximize revenues and bookings, while citygovernments are accountableto theirvoting public, who are long-term residents who live and work in the city and need housing.City economist TedEgan estimated that for every housing unitthatdisappears, there isa loss of $250,000 to $300,000 per year in impact to the citys economy.Those losses can quickly outpace the more than $1 million per month that Airbnb remits to the city in transit occupancy taxes,plus whatever hosts earn and visitorsspend, he argued.To be clear, none of this is an argument to ban or eliminateshort-term rentals. Its just to have accurate and timely data as the market scales, so that negative impacts on housing can be managed. Thata privately held company touches an increasing share of the residential housing stock in the worlds most economically productive, culturally vibrant and land-constrained cities is a matter of public concern.Permitting:Airbnbs public policy department made this graphic to criticize San Franciscos registration process.While most of this post has been harsh on Airbnb,there are areas in which the city government has made things toocomplicated.The San Francisco Planning Department decided to require in-person meetings to register as a host. Of course, thishasresulted in onlyabout625 out of thousands of hostssettingup an appointment with the city as of yesterday.The rationale is that the planning departmentwanted to make sure that the host is the personwho owns or leases a unit and that its their primary residence withproper documentation.Again, I do think this goes back to thelack of data.If you think about the situation, you have two or three dedicated, full-time planning staff members, who are paid government wages,collecting self-reported forms once a yearfromthousands of hosts.Somehow they have to replicate the database thata $20 billion company, whichcan hire the best engineers in the industrywith stock options, can probably call up on internaldashboards instantaneously.Unlike Airbnb, they are also responsible for making sure that all of these listings follow building safety, fire and health codes and they also need to make sure that none of the units are income-restricted, or affordable.Civil suits and injunctive relief:If Airbnb is not careful amid what is a very politically fractious situation, this is going to go to ballot in November.And I can tell you that the November ballot initiative, which is backed by a bunch of citizens groups and housing activists,allows Interested Parties or neighbors to win financial relief in civil courtafter a Planning Departmentinvestigation.That would raise the spectre ofneighbor-versus-neighbor lawsuits, which could have a chilling effect on the total number of listings. That would be way worse.The other legislative proposalsare more conservative on this. Farrells proposal only allows the city toobtain civil penalties, for example.Technological change and post-tourism:Lastly, its important to remember that technological changebreeds changesinthe way that we travel.Theocean liners and railroads ofthe late 19th century gave rise to grand hotels like the Waldorf Astoria in the U.S.s Gilded Age and Europes Belle Epoque. Then, the private automobile cemented the road trip as a quintessential American traveling experience, with scores ofmotels planted along the sides of highways.Jets and plane travel enabledlarge, international chainswith franchised hotelsoffering thestandardized experiences that Airbnb now criticizes for being sterile.The web, with its identity and reputation systems, is facilitating something altogether different. Much of thecurrent Airbnb opposition in San Franciscocriticizesthe companyfor turning homes into tourist hotels.But I dont think its really accurate to call what is happening tourism. Itsan entirely new market that isnt really competitive to traditional hotels.In a New York Magazinearticle touching on how expats and Airbnb are changing Berlin, Johannes Novy, an urbanist atBTU Cottbus-Senftenberg, talked about the idea of post-tourism:the notion of post-tourism doesnt represent a change in the way we travel so much as a change in the way we think about travel  and it primarily shows the extent to which technology and heightened mobility have helped obliterate categories like work and vacation, local and visitor. The idea of this new tourism puts into question a lot of fundamental things about the kinds of lives people live these days, he says. We are in a world of endless mobility, and so we are all tourists all of the time.I personally know several people who dont really live anywhere, and perma-floatfrom Airbnb to Airbnb listing globally.So at some level, theAirbnbregulatory debate might bethebeginning of a longer-term discussion about thewaywe think aboutlong-term residents versusan emergent and more globalized and mobilepopulation.Indeed, the most interestingstrugglesin urban real estate today have to do with increasingly globalized flows of capital and labor. They have to do withhowoverseascapital from non-resident home buyers and increasing flows of short-term rental touristsaresubverting the protective scaffolding the U.S. originally built half a century agoaround residential property to stimulatehome ownership for the middle-class.And that is a very interesting conversation.
