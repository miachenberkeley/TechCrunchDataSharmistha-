In a PR stunt reminiscent of Amazons Black Friday drone revelation in 2013, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has revealed that it is dabbling with drones with a teeny, tiny pilot program.The online retailer is piloting drone-based-delivery for its Taobao service with a one-off, three day campaign in China, as Tech In Asia first reported.Its worth pointing out  again  that this is a seriously limited trial. Alibaba confirmed to TechCrunch that it is limiting the trial to just 450 packets of ginger tea, which will be delivered to specific parts of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou  three of Chinas biggest cities  within one hour of order on a first-come-first-service basis.This one-off campaign is an effort to bring unique and innovative shopping experiences to consumers on Alibabas e-commerce ecosystem, a company spokesperson told TechCrunchin a statement.This campaign is clearly more aboutstyle thansubstance, but the fact that Alibaba  which, of course, held the worlds largest IPO last year  is testingdrones is significant, and clearly a sign of the future just dont expect the firmto hit the switch for all deliveries any time soon.Alibaba partnered with logistics firm YTO Expresson this project, whichisnt the first trial in China. Parcel service companySF Express tested drone delivery back in 2013, while Australia was the first place to really trialdrone-based delivery. A startup called Zookal began delivering text booksvia mini unmanned aerialvehicles back in October 2013.Let us also not forget thatSkycatch demonstrated a real-lifeTacoCopter that deliveredMexican Food at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2013.
