Alibabas accounting methods are under investigation in the U.S. The Chinese e-commerce giant, which went public in 2014 inthe largest NYSE IPO in history, quietly disclosed that the SEC is looking into whether it has violated federal securities laws.The probe focus is centered around Alibabasrelationship with its affiliate organizations, its business on Singles Day Chinas largest online shopping day in which Alibaba grossed $14.3 billion in sales last year  and other general investments. Alibaba has spent more than $40 billion on M&A over the past five years, including recent billion-dollar deals withfood delivery firm Ele.me, Southeast Asias Lazada and video site Youku Tudou, so theres plenty to pore over.The SEC has requested that we voluntarily provide it with documents and information relating to, among other things: our consolidation policies and practices (including our accounting for Cainiao Network as an equity method investee), our policies and practices applicable to related party transactions in general, and our reporting of operating data from Singles Day, Alibaba wrotein a filing.The company saidthe SEC cautioned thatthe probe shouldnt be interpreted as a sign that Alibaba has actually broken laws. Itaddedthat it has complied with the requests, which were made earlier this year.The Chinese firm has a number of affiliate companies, including Ant Financial  which controls its Alipay service  andCainiao, which is focused on logistics and recently raised its first external funding at a reported valuation of $7.7 billion.Cainiao was founded three years ago with partners from the logistics industry. Alibaba holds a 48 percent share in the business, but its exact role and financial involvement in the organization is unclear, as The New York Times pointed out last year.
