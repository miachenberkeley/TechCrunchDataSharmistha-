Alibaba has brought in a former counterfeit-battling executive from Apple to battle its own problem of fake goods.Matthew Bassiur is leaving his current role asVice President, Deputy Chief Security Officer atPfizer to take up the position ofVice President, Head of Global Intellectual Property Enforcement at Alibaba in January. Thats a new role to lead Alibaba Groups industry-leading anti-counterfeiting efforts, the company explainedin an announcement. Bassiur will report in to newly-hired business lead Michael Evans, aGoldman Sachs veteran.AsSenior Director, Global Security & Counsel for IPR Enforcement at Apple, Bassiur headed upthe U.S. companys investigative program into theft, fraud, leaks, threats and cybercrime.Bassiur, who joinedPfizer four years ago directly after a two-year stint at Apple, formerly taught IP law atRenmin University in Beijing under theFulbright program. Alibaba described him as having deep familiarity with China.Alibaba this month avoided being named on the U.S. Governments latest blacklist for fake products, but counterfeit items remain a huge problem for its business. At least in the eyes of brands that are having fake products sold on Alibabas Taobao marketplace. As Forbes recently reported, Alibaba has sophisticated software and a 2,000-strong team focused on shutting down shop owners peddling fraudulent goods, but Alibaba does also allow many Chinese sellers to continue to make money from selling fake items, so theres a compromise. It will be interesting to see howBassiurs arrival affects that dynamic going forward.
