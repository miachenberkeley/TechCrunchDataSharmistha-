Alibabais continuing its international push after hiring aGoldman Sachs veteran to leadits international business. Michael Evans, a thirty-year finance executive, has joined the company as itsnew president.Evans, wholeft Goldman at the end of2013 after 20 years with the firm, is not a new face per se, hesbeen a member of Alibabas board since its U.S. public listing last year. In his new role, Evans  who spent the last nine years at Goldman running the firms Asian operations will be responsible for leading and executing Alibabas international growth strategy, as it continues to push itsnetwork of commerce services to retailers and merchants located outside of China.Speaking back in April, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, who took the hot seat earlier this year, stressedthe need for the Chinese company toexpand its business across the world. Rather than launching e-commerce services in new markets (thoughit did recently back out of a U.S. service it launched last year), Alibabas international expansion plan focuses around positioning its services  and in particular its branded mall site TMall and its Taobao marketplace  as windows for international brands that seek to reach consumers in China.Evans, who won a gold medal for rowing at the 1984 Olympics, will report directly to Zhang and is tasked with making that pitch to international brands and retailers not currently part of Alibabas ecosystem of e-commerce services.Outside of straight-up online retail, Alibaba also offers payments service Alipay, which is expected to go public in China in the near future, and Aliyun, thecloud computing businessit recently pledged to invested $1 billion in.Globalization is Alibaba Groups most important strategy for the coming decades, and our goal is tohelp 10 million global businesses and serve 2 billion consumers around the world, Zhang said in a statement. We have beenlaying the foundation for many years and now we need a global team in place with best-in-classtalent to bring our vision to fruition. To that end, I can think of no one better than Michael to helpAlibaba become a truly global company.
