Alibaba is stumping up more than half a billion dollars to kick its lacklustremobile phone businessinto gear. The NYSE-listed e-commerce giant today announced a $590 million investment in Chinese phone-maker Meizu.The deal grants Alibaba an undisclosed minority share in the Guangdong-based company, which sold 1.5 million of its Android-based smartphonesin January, but it is particularly notable for the strategic alliance between the two.Meizu, which operates a Xiaomi-like online sales model but isyet to break into Chinas top five smartphone companiesbased on sales, will integrate its hardware with Alibabas struggling operating system. Aliyunis the business unit behind Alibabas Yun OS, which is based onAndroid and used for smartphones and smart TV sets.Alibaba Group will provide Meizu with resources and support in thefields of e-commerce, mobile Internet, mobile operating system and data analysis with theaim of developing Meizus smartphone ecosystem, the company said in an announcement, which also revealed Meizus phone will be sold via Alibabas range of online retail sites.The investment in Meizu represents a significant expansion of the Alibaba Group ecosystemand an important step in our overall mobile strategy as we strive to bring users a wider arrayof mobile offerings and experiences, said Jian Wang, Alibabas CTO, in a statement.While Alibaba is best known for its formidable collection of e-commerce sites  including marketplace Taobao and high-end mall T-Mall  the company, like Amazon, has its tentacles in a range of other areas, including smart TVs and mobile devices.The move is an interesting one when you consider that Xiaomi, the smartphone success story of 2014, is rapidly moving into e-commerce after starting out in mobile hardware and software. Thus, Alibaba is working backwards. Despite an impressive 40 percent of transactions happening from mobile devices, it wantsto reach its customers in a more personal and direct way usinghardware like smart TVs and smartphones.But Alibabas approach to mobile software is yet to bear fruit.The most notable achievable of Aliyun to date has been a run-in with Google back in 2012, when then head of AndroidAndy Rubin forced Acer to cancel a planned phone launch because it wasan incomplete version of Android. Aliyunwas spun out from the main Alibaba business months laterand, despite powering some minordevices, Alibaba has thus far not scoredany real traction with it.As an investor in Meizu, that is likely to change, although Meizu itself is overshadowed by Apple, Samsung, Lenovo and even newcomers like Xiaomi in Chinas market. The bet here for the 11-year-oldphone-maker is that a collaboration with Alibaba  which is desperate to make inroads on mobile, having also failed to create a successful chat app  can help raise its profile and popularity in China.Alibabas past mobile investments have included leading a $280 million round for messaging app Tango, a $120 milliondeal for U.S.-based mobile games startup Kabam, and a recent $10 million investment in Android games console maker Ouya. It makes sense that it is looking to complement that focus on software and services with a hardware partner, although Meizu is also still yet to prove itself in China or on the global stage.
