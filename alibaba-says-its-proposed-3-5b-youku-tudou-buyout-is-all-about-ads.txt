Alibabas proposed $3.5 billion buy outof Youku Tudou, a deal that would take the New York Stock Exchange-listed Chinese video site private if accepted, is mainly aboutadvertising with e-commerce sprinkled in, company executives explained today.Last year,Alibaba forked out $1.2 billionfora 18 percent stake in the company, which claims a monthly viewership of more than 500 million people in China. The duohave collaborated closely since then, particularly around advertising and identifying mutual users,but, in a call with analysts, Alibaba vice chairman Joe Tsai admitted that the e-commerce giant needed to buy Youku Tudououtright in order to unlockfurther synergies and business potential.Weveworked with them in various parts of the business, [including] advertising and data integration, [but] a lot of cooperation isjust partial, Tsai said. Wed like a closer integration of our resources.The deal is less about financials  Youku Tudou has struggled to post profits despite impressive year-on-year revenue growth  and much more about eyeballs.Alibaba is interested in aligning with Youku Tudou because the service, which hosts both YouTube-like free content and Netflix-style paid videos, reaches a demographic thatits e-commerce services are yet to fully penetrate: youths. Likewise, with the majority of views  and nearly 50 percent of advertising  coming from mobile devices, closer relations could help Alibaba increase footfall to its mobile apps and services,where it is yet reap the same success with advertising as desktops despite seeing high levels of sales from mobile devices.Its often overlooked that Alibaba makes its money from selling advertisingand not by charging commission on transactions, and thats another area where Youku Tudou could add value. Tsai explained that, by matchingIDs from Alibaba and Youku Tudou, the company can learn more about users and better tailor advertising and content to them to produce higherreturns for advertising partners, and an improved experience for customers themselves.Despite those focuses, it isnt onlyabout ads. As we mentioned in our earlier story, Alibaba has made a big push for entertainment with its own Netflix-style service in China, smart TVs and set-top boxes, and even a motion picture company, among other pursuits. Adding Youku Tudou to its stable bolsters that witha major viewing platform on board, whileitcould also help nab content deals at better prices  since it can offer a larger userbase to drive down content acquisition costs  and it allows Alibaba tocontinue to explorepotential synergies between its shopping and payments services and entertainment content. Tsai outlined a possible scenario that could see Youku channels funded by advertising from Alibabas network in the future, but that seemed to bea hypothetical scenario rather than explicit excerpt of the product roadmap.Youku Tudous CEO and founding shareholders have approved the deal, which values the company at $5.1 billion  an increase on its $3.9 billion market cap  but Alibabas offer remains subject to approval from all shareholders. Assuming that is granted, it is likely to be some time before the deal is completed, since it involves a NYSE firm going private.
