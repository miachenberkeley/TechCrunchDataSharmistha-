If you read the headline above and said Huh? then you are not alone. It seems Ross Ulbricht, the alleged head of Silk Road, was not the real owner of the site. According to Ulbrichts attorney, the creator was one Mark Karpeles, the disgraced head of Mt. Gox, an exchange that imploded theatrically in February.Motherboard has a reporter at the trail who noted that Ulbricht smiled when he finally made the admission.DerYeghiayan believed his evidence was so strong that he even drafted a search warrant for Karpeless email in May of 2013.The trial is currently adjourned by Judge Katherine Forrest, who said The defense has been building a picture all afternoon that Karpeles was Dread Pirate Roberts or a Dread Pirate Roberts. That has come out in spades, that that is their argument. That cat is out of the bag.Bitcoin has always been controlled by a very small cabal and this was even truer in the heyday of the Silk Road. But that Karpeles, the bumbling CEO of a completely imploded exchange the head of a drug den? It sounds far too good to be true and should make the Ulbricht trial far more interesting.Defense's alternative theory seems to be that MARK KARPELES OF MT GOX and one other were the real DPR. #SilkRoadTrial Sarah Jeong (@sarahjeong) January 15, 2015
