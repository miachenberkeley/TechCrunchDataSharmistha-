Nest, the connected home company acquired by Google last year, made the news yesterday with the departure of two of its key people: founding VP of technologyYoky Matsuoka and Greg Duffy, who had come to Nest as the CEO of acquired company Dropcam. In the wake of that, weve been passed (anonymously) two different memos from Nest co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, whichshed some more light on what is going on.In short, the company is reorganizingas it gears up to launch a raft of new products in 2015, starting with camera updates in two stages (or levels)that Nest is referring to as Quartz and Black Quartz. In line with this, and the departures, the company is adding more business and product management, redistributing some of the technology teams closer to product groups, and tying camera hardware more directly to Rogers authority.While the memos dont really offer any context for why Duffy or Matsuoka have left the company, weve seen reports elsewherethat allege culture clashes between Dropcam and Nest.We have had another tipthat points to similar problems  also anonymous  allegingthat Duffy had been in conflict with Fadell before leaving. It alsopoints to low morale after employeesweretold they would have to work Saturdays until April or May(by emailed edict a few weeks ago) because we are supposed to be pulling hard for a release we dont even believe in.One thing seemsclear: Duffy and Matsuoka were popular and their departure surprised others atthe company. Place is in shock and disbelief, another tipsterwrote to us.Nest declined to comment for this story.Were embedding the two memos below, but here are the basic details:Rogers note  possibly put out to the company in the wake of the news going public  confirms the departures of Matsuoka and Duffy, with Matsuoka moving to Twitter in an unspecified role and Duffy leaving to pursue other opportunities. Duffy later said as much himself viaTwitter.It doesnt look like either will be replaced: the algorithms team that Matsuoka led will now be reorganised to sit closer with product groups, to help [Nest} build even better products by getting our technology and algorithm roadmaps more tightly aligned.Duffys former direct reports Loren Kirkby and Greg Nelson will now report to Daphne Luong, managing engineering for e-commerce, the video service and next-generation video architecture. Meanwhile, Rogers will get a more direct grip on camera hardware, with Sam Kortz now reporting to Rogers.To follow that up, Fadell also noted some changes in a separate memo. Tom vonReichbauer, who started out as the companys CFO when he moved to Nest from Tesla, is taking on more responsibility as the companys head of business, overseeing sales and business development in addition to the operational and finance roles.And Maxime Veron, who worked forApple for many years before joiningNest in 2011, is moving over to make room fora second product marketing lead, given our ambitious roadmap for 2015 and beyond. Richard Townhill will be the companys new product marketing lead for apps and services.Updated with response from Nest.
