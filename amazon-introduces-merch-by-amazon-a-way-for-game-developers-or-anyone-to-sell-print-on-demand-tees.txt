In a clever move that combines Amazons prowess as a large online retailer and advertising platform with its footprint in the mobile gaming market, the company today introduced a new service called Merch by Amazon aimed at helping app developers  or any other content creators  increase their revenue by selling branded t-shirts to their customers.Developers and others can use the new service to create custom T-shirts that are advertised in their mobile applications or elsewhere online, then printed on demand. For each T-shirt a fan buys, the creatorearns a royalty that increases with the number of shirts sold.Largely, theidea with Merch by Amazon is to offer a self-service tool that eliminates out-of-pocket costs for developerswho want expand beyond traditional in-app advertising or in-app purchases like sales on virtual goods.Offering physical merchandise is something a number of game developers try, but it often requires upfront investment. Thats why youve seen merchandise from bigger brands over the years, like the extensive collection of toys and games from Rovios Angry Birds franchise,merchandisefrom Plants vs. Zombies,or partnerships like the one a few years back between Zynga and toymaker Hasbro, for example, but dont typically see the same fromindie developers.Meanwhile, monetizing on todays app stores is a growing challenge  especially for newcomers and smaller developers who dont have a lot of money to fuel things likeuser acquisition costs.To use Merch by Amazon, creatorsupload their custom artwork to an online dashboard  like a logo or art from theirgame  or they can use Amazonstemplates to get started. They then set the price for the t-shirt with the help of Amazons provided calculator that lets them see what the royalty per shirt will be dependingon the list price.Developers earn a royalty based on the list price they set, less Amazons costs ($8.10) and a small listing fee (15 percent). Amazonrequires that the minimum price cover its ownexpenses, which include everything from stocking the blank shirts, producing the shirts with artwork when ordered, customer service, shipping to the customer with Prime or Super Saver shipping, and selling expenses.As sales grow, the cost to print the shirts goes down, so the royalties will increase, Amazon notes. (A list of the available discounts withvolume sales is provided here.)The shirts themselves can be configured as either one- or two-sided printed tees, and creatorscan specify the material used, says Amazon. Creators pick from eitherAnvil and American Apparel brands, and the shirts are available from a single product page in mens (S-3XL), womens (S-XL), and kids sizes (K4-K12). After the sale is complete, the shirts are printed by an Amazon-owned printer and shipped to customers anywhere in the world.Because the shirts can be promotedin-game on the Android, Fire OS, or iOS versions of an appvia Amazon Mobile Ads, theyre mostlyaimed at mobile gaming developers. ButAmazon says that Merch by Amazon isnt being limited to app developers.According to a spokesperson, anyone who wants to create a T-shirt on demand and sell it on Amazon.com could use the service. They just need to register for a Merch by Amazon account on thedeveloper portal,they said.Amazons entry into the print-on-demand space challenges businesses like CustomInk, Spreadshirt, Teespring, Zazzle, CafePress and other services where users can design and sell T-shirts online.A number of developers have already been using the platform ahead of its release, includingBackflip Studios (DragonVale),Etermax (Trivia Crack),Big Blue Bubble (My Singing Monsters), ZeptoLab (Cut the Rope), Glu Mobile (Deer Hunter 2014), among others.The Merch by Amazonserviceis live here.
