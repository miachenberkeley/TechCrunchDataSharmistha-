Amazon is clearly doubling downon its Alexa-powered connected speaker Echo, and the Alexa ecosystem as a whole  and not just because its now shelling out the big bucks to advertise the product during the Super Bowl for the first time, though that, too, is notable. But the company has also put itsAmazon Appstore VP,Steve Rabuchin, in charge of Alexas growing business, including the Alexa App Store (aka Alexa Skills) and the teamsinside Amazon working to bringAlexa to other connected devices.Alexa, which is like Amazons version of Apples Siri, is a voice-activated assistant that lets you ask questions; create tasks and shopping lists; get information like news, weather and traffic; play music; set alarms;control your smart home devices;and yes  even, order things from Amazon.com.While Amazon notoriously keeps sales figures around its products close to its chest, there have been signals that the affordable Echo speaker has turned out to be one of the companys hardware hits, following the total flop of its Fire Phone and a re-organization at its hardware R&D group, Lab126.For example, Echo become the top-selling device on Black Friday 2015, for those devices over $100, and it has since continued to hold a top spot in Amazons Electronics Best Sellers list on itssite. (It was #5 in January, and has since climbed to #4.)The speaker also has a 4-and-a-half star rating, after some 31,000+ customer reviews.There have been reports of Amazon developing a smaller, more portable, and even cheaper version of the Echo speaker.Now, we hear that Rabuchin, the VPpreviously responsible for the Amazon Appstore, including the global app selection, developer outreach, business development, Amazon Underground, and more, has moved over to Alexa. This can beconfirmed on his LinkedIn profile, which notes the title change took place this month.According to LinkedIn,Rabuchin is now in charge of both the engineering and business teams who bring Alexas voice services (AVS) to connected devices and who help developers build new skills for the Alexa platform using the steadily improving Alexa SDK.Before the move, Rabuchin had spent over two years as Vice President of Amazons Appstore.Alexas own app store, meanwhile  aka the Alexa Skills section in the Amazon Alexa mobile application, which complements the Echo speaker  has also been growing in recent weeks. While a good number of todays Alexa apps are not great fart apps, joke apps and trivia games, for example  the selection has been growing.As of earlier this month, the Alexa app store had reached135 applications, including a handful of bigger names, including StubHub, AccuWeather, AOL (including HuffPost and TechCrunchdisclosure!), Automatic, Fidelity, Bandsintown, Automatic, and others.However, to make the platform more useful to consumers, it needs to be easier to add and utilize these third-party creations, and the quality of the selection needs to improve as well.Amazon has not yet responded to a request for comment about Rabuchins move.Oh, and in case you missed it  heres Amazons forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which features Alec Baldwin and Dan Marino using Amazon Echo. CBS has been asking$4.5 million to more than $5 million for a 30-second ad, reports Variety. Amazon wont say when the ad airs or what it paid.
