Amazon is famous forpress releases devoid of actual information. (As we saw after Thanksgivingthis month.)But, in a moment of selectivetruth-telling, the company just revealed that it signed upoverthree million members for its Prime program during the week beforeChristmas.There are caveats, of course, as ever.Amazon confirmed to Geekwire that this figure refers to new trial and paying members. So the actual number retained as ongoing, paying members may prove to be lower. (This is the case with over services that offer free trials, such as Apple Music.)The company just gave a figure for the third week of December  which, in case you forgot, is right beforeChristmas  so were unable to gauge how much more popular the service was than a normal week. Offering free shipping is clearly most appealing during last-minute Christmas shopping time.(Fwiw, last year, Amazon said it added 10 millionnew Prime membersover the entire holiday period.)And finally, in typical Amazon fashion, there is no word on the total number of subscribers that the service has, although it was apparently a record-breaking holiday season.Amazon Prime membership continues to grow, and there are tens of millions of members worldwide,the company added.But the three million figure does give a small glimpse into the services popularity.The $99 per year Prime service gives Amazon customers free-shipping for Amazon.com products, other shopping perks and access to its Prime video service.Netflix, which rivals Amazon on the latter, has 69 million customers across 60 countries worldwide. Amazon Prime Video is only available in the U.S., UK, Austria, Germany and (recently added) Japan, however, though Prime membership servicesare supported in more countries.Thats the most meaningful part of Amazons holiday announcement. Other carefully selected metrics  some of which include no actual, raw figures and therefore give little to no insight  include:
