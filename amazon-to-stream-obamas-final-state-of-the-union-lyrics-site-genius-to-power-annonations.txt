Following news of last nights Golden Globes wins, Amazon has now taken another step to establish itself as a streaming media competitor worth notice: for the first time, the company will now makePresident Obamas State of the Union address available for on-demand streaming through its Amazon Instant Video service, saysWhite House Chief Digital Officer Jason Goldman. The speech will also be available via the White House website and the previously established YouTube channel.However, by bringing this years SOTU to another platform, the White House is further acknowledging that the way people are watching TV has changed  that is, instead of just broadcasting the speech live across network TV and a couple of places on the web, the White Houseis working to reach viewers on the streaming services theyre already using. And Amazon is one of the top services used today, thanks to its tie-in with the popular Amazon Prime membership program.Goldman acknowledges this shift in a blog post announcing the news, saying:Around this time each year, our job in the Office of Digital Strategy has been to find new or expanded ways for the American people to engage with the Presidents address. That means meeting people where they areand in this day and age, that starts by recognizing that even people following on two screens dont just flip back and forth between a TV and a smartphone. We jump from different social media platformsand we have shifting assumptions about the type of experience well have on each.So what does it mean to meet people where they are? First, it means recognizing the massive shift in the American media diet toward on-demand video.So, for those whove cut the cord from cable and network TV: Whether you use a smart TV, web browser, mobile device, or tablet theres a way for you to watch the Presidents speech as it happens and on-demand.Amazon will post the final SOTU for on-demand viewing on Wednesday, and it will also become a home to Obamas past addresses, allowing viewers to watch the speeches on Amazons cross-platform apps for mobile, tablets, PC, or TV.Plus, with another nod to how people are using technology differently in 2016, Goldman also pointed to seven marked-up versions of the Presidents previous State of the Union addresses and the 2009 Joint Session of Congress, where lyrics and annotations service Genius is powering the interactive line-by-line annotations.Says Goldman, the annotations are meant to provide morecontext about Obamas specific proposals, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at how the speeches came together.This the first time ever that the White House has turned to the annotation platform to reach web users, notes Genius. Included in the digital collaboration will be voices from the White House, like Vice President Joe Biden, and former Director ofSpeechwriting Jon Favreau, who iscontributing his own personal insights andanecdotes about featured elements in President Obamas addresses. Another dozen or so White House staffers were involved in the effort, too.Genius users are invited to share their own thoughts and reactions, and some of those submissions may be highlighted, notes Goldman. Following the final SOTU on Tuesday, Genius says it will post an annotated version of the speech on January 12.The White House, and not just the current administration, has been embracing technological advances for some time when it comes to reaching people using modern media, Goldman points out. He notes that the first live webcast took place in 2002 during President George W. Bushs administration, for example, and Bush also broadcast the address for the first time in high-def. Meanwhile, Obamas 2011 State of the Union was the first time a President offered an enhanced live stream, referring to the slides that are shown alongside the speech itself.Obamas final State of the Union Address will air at9:00PM EST on Tuesday night, January 12, 2016.Image credits: The White House; Jason Goldman
