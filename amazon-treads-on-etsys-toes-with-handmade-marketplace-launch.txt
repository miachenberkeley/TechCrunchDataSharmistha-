Amazon has expanded its ecommerce empire yet again, opening a marketplace for handcrafted goods that takes it right onto Etsys bespoke knits.The new marketplace, Handmade at Amazon, wentlive in the U.S. earlier today  offering handmade items in the following initial categories: Jewelry, Home Dcor, Artwork, Stationery & Party Supplies, Kitchen & Dining, Furniture and Bedding.Amazon is making a big push to tout the benefits of selling on its platform to the artisans its hoping to woo to the marketplace  flagging itslarge customer base, free phone and email support, business reporting tools and custom ordering tools.Amazonsfee structure for Handmade is a 12 per cent cut per item sold, plus a monthly fee of $40 if an artisan sells more than 40 items per month from their Handmade account (although its waiving this fee until August 2016  to get the handknitted ball rolling).The company is applying strict criteria at this stage to who qualifies to sell on Handmade  noting that:All products available in your Handmade at Amazon store must be made entirely by hand, hand-altered, or hand assembled (not from a kit). Products must be handmade by you (the artisan), by one of your employees (if your company has 20 or fewer employees), or a member of your collective with less than 100 people. Mass-produced products or products handmade by a different artisan are not eligible to sell in Handmade.This positions this new sub-division of Amazon.com as more bespoke than Etsy, which opened a manufacturing program last month, allowing sellers on its platform to outsource manufacturingto approved Etsy manufacturers in order toscale their businesses (taking it furtheraway from its strictly handcrafted roots).Amazon, of course, already offers a standard marketplace option for individualsellers wanting toshop goods they didnt make themselves on Amazon.com  so it can offeran artisan-only sub-division now without any downside. Its presumablyhoping to woo smaller Esty sellers who might be disgruntled aboutcompeting with other craftspeoplethat areoutsourcing their manufacturing.Speaking an interview with the NYT, Peter Faricy, the Amazon VPoverseeing Handmade, touted the sub-division of the Amazon.comecommerce empire as a factory-free zone, a mass-produced-free zone  taking a clear side-swipe at Etsy (while side-stepping the irony that, taken as a whole, Amazon.com is absolutely not a factory-free or mass-produced-free zone).It remains to be seen whether artisans will heed Amazons call to be hostedon a bespoke sub-section of its sprawling ecommerce empire. According to the NYT, Handmade at Amazon is kicking things off with around5,000 sellers from 60 countries signed up, andmore than80,000 handcrafted items on sale.Etsy, which went public in April, has had a turbulent time in the share price department since its IPO, with investor concerns focusing on slowing revenue growth and rising costs  likely explaining why its making moves to scale sellers on its platform by opening up outsourced manufacturing. Things arent going to get any easier for the New York-based craft marketplace with Amazon squatting in its backyard.
