Amazon has been working hard to build up the popularity ofits Android-based Appstore with consumers and developers  borrowing from the well-thumbed Amazon playbook of deep discounts to drive usage. Now, a new feature it wants to launch looks like it could be its biggest disruptive storefront promotion yet. The company has beenworking on anew section called Unlocked that will offer users a whole range of paid apps, along withthose that utilizein-app purchases, free of charge.Think of it as Amazon Prime for apps.Introducing Amazon Unlocked for Apps & Games, the company notes in one promotional spot. Paid apps and in-app purchasing now completely FREEfrom Amazon.TechCrunch learned of the new featureby way of an internal presentation, leaked to us, explaining how the new feature will look.App developers whose apps are highlighted in the deck include biggies like Sega America, whose Sonic Dash game features prominently in the presentation; as well as notable independents like UsTwo, whoseMonument Valley game is also flagged as an Unlocked app.Other non-gaming apps listed in the deck includeOfficeSuite 8 + PDF Converter  one of the more popular apps for reading and editing Microsoft Office apps on Android devices; andUltimate Guitar Tabs & Chords.The first of these is a free app with in-app purchases, while the latter is a paid app with additional items that can be purchased in the app. Under the Unlocked promotion, everything in and around these apps would be free.Details such as when Unlocked is expected to launch, or the full list of actual participating apps, is not notedin the presentation.Weve reached out to Amazon spokespeople for comment and will update when and if they respond. Developers we have contacted have told us they are under NDA and cannot discuss anything.Butthe basics are outlined simply enough in the presentation, which uses the code names Gretzky and Snuffy to respectively describe the new featureand user flow around it.(Why Gretzky and Snuffy? I dont knowbut my guess is hockey  Wayne Gretzky and Carl Snuffy Liscombe being two of the greats of the game. And hockey is a pretty goodmetaphor for how quickly users shoot and bouncefrom one app to another.)In a preamble to the presentation, the company sets out its objectives: the program needs to beclearly identifiable to users; the selected apps need to be obvious to users; and the apps are conveyed as high value provided by Amazon. There arealso some interesting attempts at a less cluttered experience: Customers should not feel overwhelmed by thousands of apps, but can get them if they need to, the presentation notes. Gretzky Gateway should operate primarily on algorithms rather than human touch.To that end, Unlocked will get promoted prominently in Amazons own flagship app, and there areplans to use social networks and other platforms to promoteUnlocked. The new feature is there not just to drive more downloads from the Appstore, but also more downloads of the Amazon app, which usersneed in order to access the Unlocked selectionof apps.Once users download the Amazon app, and then the Unlocked version of a selected app, they will be presented withfurther Unlocked branding each time that an in-app purchase has been waived, along with more options to share the experience with others. Gretzky apps are easy to share and focus on app not Appstore when shared, the company notes.For those browsing the Appstore in the Amazon app, they will have the option to filter searches to lookonly for Unlocked apps, or to see them in a mix with other offerings. As with other Amazon e-commerce experiences, users are given recommendations based on what they have downloaded already and other parameters.The wider context of Unlocked is interesting on a couple offronts.The first is that this is one more example of how Amazon is turning to price-busting moves to boost activity on its platform.Amazon is no stranger to offering deep discounts  or free items  to users to drive more business to its products and services, whether its on pricing for books, or shipping and video content through Prime, or enterprise services through AWS.The move puts pressure on competitors that struggle tomatch the prices that Amazon offers and Amazon wins by playing up the volume-based game of aggregating lots of revenues on thin margins, through economies of scale, and simply making their platform more sticky for users to come back for more.The Appstore is no different. The company regularly offers a free daily app to users, and to mark the Amazon Appstores fourth birthday, the e-commerce giantis currently promoting a larger freebundle of 34 appsthat usually cost between $0.99 and $9.95.Some of its free moves have been controversial. As one outspoken developer pointed out back in 2011 when the Appstore first launched, for all the glory of 100k+ downloads, he didnt see a penny of income from it.However, from what we understand this is not entirely true and there is some compensation in certain cases.How popular the game is changes how much compensation you get, one person says. Amazon uses these free deals to lure people who use Android onto their store, so are more than happy to pay for these deals.And if there are some who arent happy with free promotions,that hasnt stopped the service from remaining a popular way to boost users. Indeed, anotherdeveloper I spoke to about Unlocked was very clear to ask to remain anonymous. I like the free app promotion and hope to be included one day, he said.That may bewhat Amazon may be trying to address here. You see,Unlocked has a bit of a twist to it: When developers leave the Unlocked program, the extras become paid again.This effectively means that developers whoget nothing to begin with as the barrier to entry is lowered for new downloads, can hope to convert those users to paying customers when the wall comes back up.The other area where the Unlocked promotion is interesting is simply in terms of the effort that Amazon is makingto boost the Appstore. The company today is approaching 400,000 apps in its catalogue, but this still pales when compared to the 1.2 millionapiece on Google Play or Apples App Store.Beyond the numbers game, the company has facedotherhurdles for its app business. Sales of devices like its own Fire Phone have been low, and that is reportedly driving developers away from Amazons ecosystem.And it has facedchallenges as an alternative to Google Play for other Android owners, too. Last year,Google delistedAmazons flagship app from the Play store after Amazon quietly integratedits Appstore, and so now, those who want to access it directly from their devices have to navigate to a download from the web and then specifically tweak security settings in order to permit it to work.Will Unlocked unlock an app store jackpot for Amazon? Its anyones guess, but asthe company continues to look for ways to be relevant in the mobile economy, it will be one more way to try in what is likely to be a much wider, longer-term strategy.After all, as Mike George, Amazons VP of apps and games said back in February, We have patience and we take a long view of all these things that were doing, and we really do start with our customersAnd if we dont get it the first time, we keep iterating and inventing until we do.
