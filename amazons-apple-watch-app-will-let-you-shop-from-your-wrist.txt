Though online retailer Amazon wasnt among one of the many applications Apple introduced this week as coming soon to its new wearable device, the Apple Watch, the company does have an Apple Watch version of its mobile shopping app in the works, we understand. The shopping appwill allow consumersto search for products and even buy themfrom their wrist using Amazons 1-Click ordering system.Of course, its not surprising that Amazon will address the forthcoming mobile platform  after all, the company tends to release a version of its shopping app on almost any viable mobile or connectedplatform, not just its own Kindle hardware. And it already has an Android Wear (i.e., smartwatch) version of its shopping app in the wild, so it makes sense that it would build the Apple Watch counterpart, too.In fact, our understanding is that the Apple Watch version of the Amazon shopping app will operate just like the current Amazon app for Android Wear.That means it will support the ability to search for items using your voice, save products to your Amazon Wishlist, and even the ability to check out quickly using Amazons 1-Click ordering. (Oh, this could be dangerous, I think.)The retailer, however, is not officially confirming the details aroundits new Apple Watch app at this time, but instead is only hinting that such a thing is in the works. Acompany spokesperson told usthe only statement theyre offering for now is as follows:Amazon is constantly innovating on behalf of our customers. We are committed to being anywhere customers want to shop. That includes watches. We have an Amazon shopping app for Android Wear and will look to expand to other devices.Other devices essentially confirms Amazons plans to release anApple Watch app, if you read between the lines, of course.(Note: Above image is a mock-up.)
