The (in)famous former Top Gear presenter trio: Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, who last summer signed to Amazons Prime video streaming platform to make a new car show to be screened on its platform this year, have revealed what its going tobe called  and its The Grand Tour.Why a tour? Because the show format will see the studio portion of each episodescreened from a new location somewhere in the world  from inside a giant tent, rather than a studio. So really they should have called itCarry On Camping With Clarkson & Co.The format of The Grand Tour will also feature short films shot in different locations around the globe  so basically it sounds exactly like Top Gear, just with a new name. And a tent.Why mess with a winning formula, eh?The presenters make a lot of thisgiant tent in the PR announcing the shows name, so it can quite possibly be seen as a troll of the BBC, the owner of the Top Gear format. The Corporationdecided not to renewClarksons contract last year, after investigating an unprovoked physical attack on a Top Gear producer by Clarkson.And where Clarkson goes, May and Hammond duly follow And so The Grand Tour.Tickets for attending the tent-portion of the show will be released through a sweepstakes this summer. Its not clear if they will only be open to Amazon customers or more widely. Amazonsaid details of the location schedule and information on how to apply for tickets will be announced shortly.The new Top Gear Grand Tour will be screened to Amazon Prime customers, starting this fall. Amazon will clearly be hoping to pick up some of the millions of viewers who tuned in to watch Top Gear when it was anchored by Clarkson todrive (pun intended) uptake of its Amazon Prime paidsubscription.The last episode of Top Gear with Clarkson & co.presenting drew some 5.3 million viewers.The BBC has since rebooted Top Gearwith a new line-up of presenters. This new BBC carshow, sans Clarkson & co.,willkick off its first episode on May 29.
