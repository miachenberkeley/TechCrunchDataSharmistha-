Amazons X-Ray is a great Kindle feature, providing a healthy heaping of context on demand about things like plot, characters, authors and more. Now, it can also offer context for movies and TV shows, onFire TV and Fire TV Stick devices with a new, free, over-the-air update going out today.With the new update, youll be able to figure out where youve seen actors and actresses before directly from the on-screen interface, with information about cast, crew, trivia, soundtrack and more supplied by IMDb, which is most likely where youd navigate yourself on your smartphone, tablet or laptop to look up facts about what youre watching anyway.The new X-Ray feature for Fire TV is accessible using the set-top boxs remote, allowing you to ask questions like what is this actor in? right from the couch without having to pick up another device. It can also provide background info about the character theyre portraying, giving you more context if, for instance, youre joining a TV show mid-way through its run and dont feel like bingeing on back seasons to get caught up.Its a pretty cool feature, but one that Im unsure how much Id use in practice. It is true that Im often curious enough to look up cast and other information about shows Im actively watching on my devices, but the nice thing about that process is actually that it happens offline, without encroaching on the content youre actually trying to view on the big screen. Something tells me Im still going to prefer that paradigm, but this is an interesting way to unite first- and second-screen experiences nonetheless.
