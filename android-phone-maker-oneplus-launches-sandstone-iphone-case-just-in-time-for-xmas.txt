Its been a busy year for OnePlus. The Chinese company unveiled its much-anticipated OnePlus 2 this summer and followed that up with the OnePlus X in October. Now, the Shenzhen-based Android phone maker is closing the year with one final small  but interesting  release an iPhone case.Yes, thats right. OnePlus has put its signature sandstone finish into a case thatll house an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s.Why, you ask?I have my own thoughts  its a fun promotion for publicity (like this story) and also a way to raise the brand among Apple customers  but OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei told TechCrunch that is a gesture for those in the world who are stuck with iPhones.Although most of my friends have converted to the OnePlus family, theres still a hand full stuck with iPhones. This is for them. I think a lot of OnePlus fans can relate, Pei said in a statement.Cynicism aside  and I am usually pretty cynical about PR stunts  I was pretty surprise by the case, which OnePlus sent out to me in the mail. (Im one of those poor Apple users I guess.)The finish is unlike other premium iPhone covers Ive seen before, the texture gives you a strong grip and the case feels sturdy enough and heavy duty Im really not a fan of Apples all-silicon options. Ultimately the choice of case is a personal decision, but those I showed the case to thought it was pretty neat.Given this time of the year, it might make for a unique Christmas present.The OnePlus iPhone case is available onits online storefor $19.99/15.99.For that price youll also get an invite to buy the companys OnePlus X device  thats a move that has hadsome peopleaccusing OnePlus of effectively selling the invite. I think thats a little unfair, this is a fun move from a company that is into PR stunts (having hopefully learned alesson from past failures). My only irritation is that there is no OnePlus case for the iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6S Plus  my phone of choice  but we can chalk that up as a first world problem.
