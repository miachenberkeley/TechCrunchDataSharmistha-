Googles second foray into television, Android TV, has been a bit slow off the starting blocks in some respects  app support was one area where it definitely felt a little threadbare. Now, however, Google is expanding its software catalogue considerably, adding over 600 new apps via a Play Store update today for Android TV devices, including the Nexus Player.The new 600+ apps are also categorized into 20 new collections that help it easy to find specific types of apps like movies, sports, news, multiplayer games and more. The update should be showing up on compatible devices now, and youll see the new content in the store navigation area of your device.At Google I/O this year, the company talked about Android TV gainingfeatures via Cast, but didnt say much about local apps. An expanded library is great news for Googles own hardware, and for partners like the Nvidia Shield using Android TV in their own devices. Competition in the streaming set-top device market is getting a lot more fierce, and I cant help but wonder if this wasnt a pre-emptive move designed with Apples rumored Apple TV SDK in mind, though word is that will be delayed likely until at least fall.
