Apple Watch not for you? The Amazon preorder page for the Huawei Watch states that the device will support iOS. Now, at this point, its unclear if this is a typo or unreleased information  lets hope its the latter.So far iPhone owners have had a limited amount of smartwatches to choose from, say just the Apple Watch and Pebble devices. Likewise, there are dozens of different Android Wear models available, each offering a slightly different look and feature set from each other. If Android Wear gains iOS compatibility, suddenly iPhone owners will have a huge selection of available smartwatches.The Huawei Watch itself is a suave if not a bit gaudy wristwatch with a decidedly upscale look. It starts at $349 with a stainless steel casing and a leather band. Yet each model, from the $350 to $800 model, packs a 1.4-inch circular AMOLED display and reportedly iOS 8.2 compatibility. Amazon says the device will ship to buyers starting on September 2nd.Weve reached out to both companies for comment.
