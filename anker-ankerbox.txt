Screens, cameras, and connectivity on our smartphones are gettingbetter and better(yay!),but battery tech is lagging behind (boo!). As a heavy smartphone user, youll know that dreaded feeling of your battery marching relentlessly from healthy life, via threatened and endangered, towards extinction.The most common solution to the problem is to carry a charger or a USB battery pack, but both have downsides: Youve got to remember to charge the battery pack, and power plugs are often few and far between. AnkerBox is a charger-as-a-service solution that is hoping to put an end to all that.AnkerBox in actionTo use AnkerBox, a user downloads the app (available for iOS and Android), and can use the app to rent or return the chargers, much in the same way that you can use a bike-sharing system, or the already existing FuelRod battery-pack system.Launching as aSeattle-based pilot program on April 15th, the company is aiming to put an end to dead phones in Seattle. To run its proof of concept, it hasmore than200 bars, restaurants, gyms, and other locations set up to get a blanket coverage of the city.After youve installed the app, youcan use AnkerBox to get a quick, 30-minute boost for free. If you need the battery pack for longer, take it with you and you pay $1.99 per day until you return it to any AnkerBox charging station. The company has taken a flexible stance to their loss policy, too: If you want to keep the charger forever, or if you misplaceit, you pay $30, and its yours.After the pilot program in Seattle, the company is planning to expand to other cities. It wouldnt confirm which ones specifically, but New York and Los Angeles were mentioned.The AnkerBox battery packs are small and rugged, but the company is taking a big gamble in hoping that people arent smart enough to bring their own battery packs along yetYou probably know Anker best as the company that makes high-speed chargers for your car and home, and battery packs for when youre gallivanting about. The new company, AnkerBox, is a startup funded by its parent company Anker, but operates with a different business model; instead of an e-commerce oriented B2C customer, AnkerBox is augmenting Ankers coverage by taking a service approach.To the businesses hosting the charging stations, AnkerBox is positioning itself as a feature that can help increase the footfall to locations featuring the devices. The company installs the AnkerBox stations for free, but isnt currently offering a revenue share to the merchants.Its going to be interesting to see whether device charging on the go is a big enoughproblem to the average consumer thatAnkerBox will take off, or whether people have become savvy enough  in part due to Ankers own efforts  to bring their own chargers or power packs along with them.
