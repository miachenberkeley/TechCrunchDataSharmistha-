Anker, the company that makes affordable, good-quality backup batteries and other accessories without the hefty price tag of some of its competitors, is answering the call of USB-C. To serve buyers of the new 12-inch MacBook and Chromebook Pixel (as well as countless future devices), the accessory-maker today unveiled a line of USB-C cables, adapters, hubs, backup batteries and more.The range covers the gamut from USB-C to USB 2.0 and 3.0, Lightning and Micro USB cables; to multi-port USB 3.0 hubs (complete with Ethernet); to display adapters and docking stations; to high-capacity mobile chargers that can power your MacBook at full charging speed multiple times over.Apple touted the open USB-C standard as one of the strengths of the new MacBook, and now that accessory makers are starting to get into the game, its going to ease arguably the biggest pain associated with Apples aggressively futuristic single-port notebook design. In my review, I noted that I actually didnt mind the lack of physical I/O ports on the MacBook, especially given how I planned to use it primarily. Still, having a goodie bag of options for the rare occasions when you would like to connect to wired Internet, for instance, would definitely be nice.Ankers lineup is mostly still coming soon, but the USB-C to USB 2.0 cable, 4-port USB 3.0 hub, and 3-port USB 3.0 hub with Ethernet are all up for pre-order with shipping dates of late June and early July.Others are attempting to fill the same new demand, including the Voltus, which is currently funding on Kickstarter. Anker could beat them to market, however, and Im sure this isnt the last well see of accessories from established third-party vendors.
