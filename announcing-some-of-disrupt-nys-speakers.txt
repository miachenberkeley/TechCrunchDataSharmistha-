With a crisp design and a neatly packaged edition of the news, theSkimm provides a ton of vitamins in a tasty medicine capsule. That medicine goes down well for theSkimms users which include a healthy dose of millennial women and A-list celebrities as well as over a million others.Next up, we have Alex Chung, Founder of Giphy and its CEO.Giphy has taken the new movingpicture world by storm, and no matter how you pronounce it, has become a one-stop shop for the best animated reactions, exclamations and approbations.Fresh off of a $55M raise, where it was valued at $300M and a new partnership with Twitter, where it is one of the default delivery engines for a built-in gif button, Chung will be with us to chat about looping, scaling, captioning and other gif-related technical terms.Also, perhaps, about the cultural impact and shorthand of the gif and how it has risen (back) to power.And last but not least, were also announcing that well be speaking to Adi Sideman, CEO of YouNow.
