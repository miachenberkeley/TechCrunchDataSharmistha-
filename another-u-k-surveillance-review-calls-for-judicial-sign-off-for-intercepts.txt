Another independent report into U.K. government surveillance has concluded interception warrants should require judicial sign-off, rather than being sanctioned by ministers as is the case now.This followsthe publication of theAnderson surveillance reviewlast month which also urged the government to adopt judicial sign-off.The U.K. is alone among the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance powers in not having a judicial process for signing off interception warrants.Late last monthHome Secretary Theresa May said the government was considering the Anderson recommendations, and had not yet made adecision on the judicial sign-offpoint, although in earlier comments (reported in The Guardian) the governmentappeared to pourcold water on the idea of handing off warrant authorization to judges.The government has said it is committed to introducing new surveillance legislation, the forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill, in the current parliament, with a timetable to introduce a draft bill this autumn  with a view to gaining Royal Assent next year before emergency surveillance legislation (DRIPA) expires at the end of 2016.The latestU.K. surveillance powers review, conducted by defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI)  at the request ofthe governments former deputy Prime Minister, in the wake ofthe Edward Snowden revelations  concludes it foundno evidence the government knowingly acts illegally in intercepting private communications.This despite the judicial oversight body for the U.K.s intelligence agencies, the IPT,itself ruling earlier this year thatGCHQ had acted unlawfully in the past in its data-sharing arrangements with the NSA. A second IPT ruling also judged GCHQ has broken the lawinits handling of intercepted comms data pertaining to two humans rights organizations  breaching its own internal rules and violating the human rights of the target groups.The RUSIs report aligns with the government position on mass surveillance being a necessary tool for intelligence gathering too  arguing that some degree of untargeted data collection,involving the collection of data in bulk, may sometimes be required, especially given thenature of modern communications  and claiming it found no evidence that mass surveillance is being used to provide the state with a perpetual window into the private lives of British citizens.Andersons report generally supported theuse ofmass surveillance  going against the prevailing view fromEuropean rights bodies and recent political moves to row back domestic dragnets in theU.S.  although he saidsuchpowers mustbe subject to strict additional safeguards, such as the aforementioned judicial sign-off for interceptwarrants, if they are to be acceptable.The RSUI follows what is now aclearconsensusthat reform of U.K. surveillance legislation is needed, identifiing an urgentneed for a new, comprehensive and clearer legal framework forauthorizing interception, noting:We have seen evidence that the present legal framework authorising the interception of communications is unclear, has not kept pace with developments in communications technology, and does not serve either the government or members of the public satisfactorily. A new, comprehensive and clearer legal framework is required.That said, itdoes not support the earlier Intelligence and Security Committees call for a single act of Parliament to govern how spy agencies operate, arguing that substantial reform does not require consolidating all existing legislation in this area. It is also not supporting separate legislation for the police and the security agencies.The RSUI calls for new surveillance legislation in this session of Parliament to provide a new democratic mandate for digital intelligence, asserting that: The present arrangements are too complex to be understood by the citizen and have contributed to a public credibility gap that must be addressed.It also sets out ten tests it believesany new legislation must pass before it can be regarded as giving the police and the intelligence agencies a democratic licence to operate  such as intrusion being in accordance withthe rule of law; being justified as necessary to explicit tasks and missions; being judged as proportionate to the advantages gained; being subject to an effective oversight regime, and the applicable legal regime beingtransparent and clear, and comprehensive to the public.The secret parts of the state must draw and observe clearboundaries between that which must remain secret (such as intelligence sourcesor the identity of its employees) and all other aspects of its work which shouldbe openly acknowledged. Necessary secrecy, however, must not be a justificationfor a wider culture of secrecy on security and intelligence matters, the report adds.The 154-page report, entitled A Democratic Licence To Operate, isbased ona year of investigation and consultation, and drawson views frominvestigative journalism, the Internet, law, policing, political life, moral philosophy.Former heads of the three U.K.intelligence and security agencies were also consulted.Update: Responding to the report, civil liberties campaign group Privacy Internationalflags uptheRSUIs finding that the existing technical oversight regime does not check the code [that underlies GCHQs interception capabilities], nor does it have the capacity to do so  arguing this is a clear deficiency and asymmetry in U.K. surveillance oversight capabilities.GCHQs mass surveillance systems rely heavily on computer automation and processing to crunch the large numbers of private communications that it collects. When GCHQs processing goes wrong, it results in large volumes of material erroneously collected. Adequate technical oversight is necessary to prevent this from happening, it says.Commenting in a statement, Privacy Internationals deputy director,Eric King, added: It should be obvious that the most technologically advanced government agency, with the most intrusive powers, would require oversight bodies to have the independent technical chops to match. Yet today, our oversight relies on technical errors to be self-reported by GCHQ itself.Fundamentally, our safeguards against abuse will not be effective when the core technical activities of GCHQ cannot be kept in check by equally technically-equipped overseers. While recent efforts by the Interception Commissioner have been made, they are essentially trying to make the best of what is an impossible situation.While we applaud such efforts to navigate this problem, this is a gaping structural deficiency, plain as day, that needs to be fixed. A better resourced, more technically-equipped oversight body who can take GCHQ to task should be a priority in the coming discussion of reform.
