Greatfire, a service that monitors blocked websites in China, is suffering from a DDOS attack that is sending 2.6 billion requests per hour to its servers  a 2500% increase in traffic  with the aim of destroying the business.The company is currently seeing $30,000 in bandwidth fees per day and but is hoping for amnesty from Amazon who hosts its data. NGOs use the service to unblock various news sources around the world including The Tibet Post and the site is the primary source for information on blocked keywords in China. They blame the attacks on interest in a recent WSJ article about Chinese censorship.The admins write:The Great Firewall is a pernicious system that will block or throttle various websites depending on political content. While many customers can route around the damage by roaming over cellular or using VPNs, the Chinese rank and file often find themselves in an Internet of the Partys making. Services like Greatfire are non-profit and aim to help the network exploit cracks in Chinas cyberarmor.The company is asking for help via Twitter so if youre good at stopping DDOSes, these guys need some help.
