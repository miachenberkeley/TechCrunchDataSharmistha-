It isnt often that we hear thatan 18-month-old startup raised$56 million, and itseven less likelywhenthe company is based in Asia  but thats exactly the case for Antuit, a big data startup that is headquartered in Singapore.Goldman Sachs led the $56 millionround, which included participation from existing investor Zodius Capital, an India-based VC firm thatput $3 million into Antuitin 2013.Antuit provides big data analytics and consultancy for a range of different business. It counts more than 20 companies on its client roster, includingeight Fortune 500 firms. In more basic terms, the startup takes big data and statistical analysis and applies it in a practical way to help businesses make smarter decision. Forexample, it might assist a multinational planning its entry into a new country, or advise a consumer brand preparingthe sale of a new product.The difference between Antuit and other big data firms is that the company offers more than just access to complex systems and models. Instead,it operates on a more partner-like basis, working with clients to structure data and intelligence, analyze it, and then model it basedon the immediate needs of the business.Essentially, were helping clients to create a value chain that progresses to insight and can be used to execute, Antuit CEO Arijit Sengupta told TechCrunch. We believe that we can do a lot for our customers becausewe stitch together all the components for big data.Though it is based in Singapore,Sengupta stressed that Antuit is a global company. It has offices in New York (via a 2013 acquisition), Seattle,Bangalore and Auckland, and Sengupta said its clients are mixedbetween North America and Asia.Startups targeting the U.S. generally tend to be based there, but ex-IBM execSengupta explained that Antuit adopteda contrarian approach to take advantage of opportunities in Asia.We werefirst to market here so we could get the benefit of being local to Asia, but we also recognized that we hadto be in the U.S. too, he explained.Sengupta said the new capital will go towards expanding the Antuit business into Europe. He added that the company is looking for newacquisitionopportunities and will consider partnership-based routes.Wehave fairly aggressive growth plans, M&A is part of that but not the only component to our expansions. We may work with clients also, and we could deploy resources [and expand our locations] with different kind of deals with customers, he said.The funding is about rapidly expanding the businesss footprint, and, in addition to new geographies, that also requires the right kind of hiring.Sengupta didnt disclose how many staff Antuit has right now, but he is keen to add seasoned individuals, which he admitted means a heftysalary bill.To be disruptive one has to move fast, there is some risk in this [expensive approach], but weve been through this journey before and want to play the big game, he said.Additional plans for Antuit include developing data products in-houseandworking with universities to researchnew ways to interpret and analyze big data.Goldman Sachs has invested in big data startups before, but this is its first such deal inAsia.Ankur Sahu, the co-head of private equity at Goldman Sachs in Asia, said that the firm believes big data analyticscan be the next wave of global services andthe market has tremendousgrowth potential.Sengupta said there was good chemistry between both sides and that the deal was concluded smoothly. He explainedthat the bankinggiantstrack record and experience scaling companies  not to mention expansive networkwere major reasons for taking it on as an investor.Antuit has largely existed under the radar in Asia, perhaps because of the nature of its business, but fewstartups in the region will raiselarger rounds of fundingin 2015.Thats likely toputthe company on the map and also serve as a strongendorsement for Singapore as a base for global startups.
