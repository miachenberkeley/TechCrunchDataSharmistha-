AOL is announcing another acquisition  Kanvas Labs, maker of mobilesocialapps.An AOL spokesperson told me that the company will continue to offer the existing Kanvas Labs products. Those include photo editing app Kanvas; Kanvas Keyboard, which allows users to add GIFs and stickers to their mobile conversations; and Kanvas for Messenger, which integrates the startups products into Facebook Messenger.There are plans to integrate Kanvas technology with AOLs products, too.The startupsaid in February that the photo app had been installed 1 million times. Thats not an enormous audience, at least by some standards, but it could give AOL a foothold with younger users  you know, the ones who dont get all those jokes about AOL dial-up.The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. AOL said the entire Kanvas Labs team will be joining the company and working out of its New York City headquarters. (AOL owns TechCrunch. Also, I work out of that office.)The combination of AOL and Kanvas Labs adds to our vision of reaching consumers on a global scale, said Kanvas Labs CEO Vic Singh in an emailed statement.Of course AOL itself was acquired by Verizon a few months ago. A big reason for the deal was AOLs ad technology, which has been growingthrough acquisitions.
