Tim Armstong has had a busy year. Back in May, AOL (owner of TechCrunch) got acquired by giant U.S. carrier Verizon for $4.4 billion. While AOL is now a subsidiary of Verizon, Armstrong said that he would continue to head up AOL after the deal was completed. Thats why we are excited to announce that Tim Armstong will join us on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt London on December 7-8, 2015.Armstrong joined AOL in 2009 to become CEO and chairman. Before that, he was President for the Americas and SVP for ad sales and operations at Google. Hes been key to AOLs turnaround with strategic acquisitions and a new focus on content, video and advertising technology.When it comes to consumer-facing brands, AOL is the owner of many content websites, such as the Huffington Post, Engadget, Moviefone, Autoblog, Cambio, Stylelist and us. It also operates consumer products, such as AOL Mail, MapQuest and more. And finally, a non-negligible chunk of the companys revenue still comes from its historic dial-up business.But getting AOL back into shape was just the first step. Now that the company is part of Verizon, AOL could focus on new areas of opportunity. AOLs video content could play an important role in go90s future. AOL also remains one of the leading advertising platforms when it comes to video ads in the U.S., which is also key when it comes to distributing over-the-top content.For all these reasons, were excited to interview my boss boss boss boss boss at our conference in London. Other speakers include BlaBlaCars Nicolas Brusson, Eileen Burbidge, Thierry Henry, TransferWises Taavet Hinrikus, Klaus Hommels, Postmates Bastian Lehmann and more.
