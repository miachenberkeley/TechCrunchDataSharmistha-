Six months into its acquisition by Verizon for $4.4 billion, AOL is doing some trimming of its workforce. TechCrunch has learned, and confirmed, that AOL has laid off around 100 employees, as it looks to eliminate overlap with its new owner and decentralize some functions.The market changes and we at AOL change ahead of the market, Caroline Campbell, AOLs SVP of of Brand and Communications, said in a written statement. As we have continued to do over the last six years, we have re-aligned a handful of key customer functions to put our consumers and customers more squarely at the center.We have done 3 years of deals in the last 6 months. We are aligning the organization for the same level of growth in 2016.This latest round of layoffsbreak down as two-thirds in AOLs Membership division, and the rest in roles like marketing, advertising and social that were not tied to any specific AOL-owned brand like TechCrunch or Huffington Post, but instead worked across several organizations. Thecompany is looking to take away some of that operations layer and put more emphasis on people who are working on specific businesses.To that end, from what we understand, there is also going to be some hiring in the first part of the new year; and some of the people who werelaid off yesterday may move to other roles as a result of the strategic change.On the Membership side, its not too much of a surprise to see AOL trimming staff. Things like AOL dial-up subscriptions have  surprisingly, considering the wider trends in the market and AOLs own emphasis on content and ad tech  continued to account for a significant chunk of AOLs revenue. Even as late as 2013, Membership was AOLs biggest revenue generator.More recently, Membership is still a significant but decreasing revenue area. In Q1 of this year  the last time AOL filed financials as an independent company  Membership accounted for $182.6 million, or about 30% of revenues. But Internet subscriptions and customer service connected to that arealso areas that massively overlap with what AOLs new owner, Verizon, does. So in a move for integration and cost efficiencies, it makes sense that this would get addressed.But even while AOL is working on ways to decentralize some functions, its also looking at ways of leveraging economies of scale to help vault its brands and advertising into the next generation of media business.Earlier today, Tim Armstrong, AOLs CEO, was on stage at Disrupt in London, where he commented on how the plan will beto invest more into individual companies; and work on moving away from outdated ad formats like display ads, and outdated metrics like page views.From what we understand, this maycome with a larger overhaul. This could include several brands moving on to a new CMS to help createnative ads that would run across several properties and also so that AOLcould interface more easily with third-partyplatforms like Facebook and its push into Instant Articles. AOL appointed a new EVP and president for its content and consumer brands, Jimmy Maymann, in September 2015, who is looking at how to improve these areas in a more concerted way.Verizon has shown that its in an acquisitive mindset in its shift to becoming more of a media business and there have even been rumors that it could be one of the companies interested in making an offer for Yahoo, and perhaps other properties that are seeing their valuations getting hit in the market today.It will be worth watching whether Verizon-owned AOL lays off further employees as it focuses on what is growing and cuts out what is not. AOL currently has around6,000 employees, and in January, ahead of the Verizon sale, AOL closed several sitesthat were underperforming and eventually laid off 150 employees, with an emphasis in sales.There have been other significantrestructuring moves further back, in part around its former struggling hyperlocal news service Patch.A video of Armstrongs appearance at Disrupt is below:
