A number of technology companies took to the airwaves during last nights Super Bowl 50 broadcast to make their names  and brands  better known amonga mainstream audience. However, according to new data out today from TiVo, which historically tracks viewer engagement with Super Bowl ads across its network, the only tech company to make intothe list of the top 10 Super Bowl ads was Apartments.com.Its controversial advertisement titled Moving On Up, featuring Lil Wayne and Jeff Goldblum, was the #7 most engaging ad, said TiVo, falling in behind other popular household names like Pepsi, Doritos, and Mountain Dew, for example.The ad was also most-watched, when compared with those from other tech companies, said TiVo. (That may not be a good thing, however, given that TMZ called out the advertisement for being low-key racist for its depiction ofLil Wayne cooking dinner for George Washington, a former slave owner.)TiVo says it determines its rankings based on aggregated,anonymous, second-by-second audience measurement data from a sample size of approximately 30,000 anonymous households with TiVos service. Interest in an advertisement is based on what percentage of the audience is watching the ad in play speed.The most engaging ads are those that see the biggest increase in viewership relative to the viewership in the surrounding 15 minutes of programming, the company also notes.In addition to Apartments.com, other tech companies whose ads did well with viewers include Machine Zones $5 million ad for the Mobile Strike gamefeaturing Arnold Schwarzenegger, which ranked #2 out of all tech companies ads.Next wasAmazon.coms adpromoting its connected speaker Echo and the powers of its virtual assistant, Alexa.
