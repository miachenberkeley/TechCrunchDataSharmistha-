Apple has confirmed that it will open its first retail store in Southeast Asia, located in Singapore, as the U.S. phone maker begins toincrease its efforts in the regions fast-growing smartphone market.The company quietly began hiring for retail staff inSingapore last week  as Tech In Asia first reported  and todayAngela Ahrendts, Apples Senior Vice President for Retail and Online Stores, confirmed that an Apple Store is indeed coming.We have more than 900 incredible employees working in our Singapore contact center and are thrilled to begin hiring the team that will open our first Apple Store in Singapore  an incredible international city and shopping destination,Ahrendts said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. We cant wait to deliver the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world.In addition,Reuters reports that the store, and the companys entire operations in Singapore, will be powered by renewable energy in a move that mirrors initiatives in the U.S., Europe and, most recently, China.Apple hasnt confirmed when the store will launch or where it will be located, although theres been speculation that the firm has already secured retail space atKnightsbridge, in the city-states much-sought-after Orchard Road shopping hotspot. Thats according to a note from the existing tenants whoclaim they are vacating to make space for Apples store.Apple currently uses a mix of licensed third-party retail partners, carriers and its online store for sales in Southeast Asia. Singapore is a country that is among the first wave of launches for new Apple products and therefore a logical first step for expanding the companys retail footprint.It isnt clear whether the companyis actively planning to introduce its own stores in other parts of Southeast Asia,which is alreadya focal point for Samsung and smartphone makers from China, such as Xiaomi and OnePlus.Analyst firm IDC reported this summer that sales of smartphones across Southeast Asia, which counts a cumulative population of over 500 million, grew by 66 percent year-on-year to reach 24 million units between April and June. While that volume is far below China or the U.S., the regional market in Southeast Asia is far from saturated  unlike China and the West and thatspellsopportunity.Exact marketshare for Apple in Southeast Asia isnt clear but, despitemid- and low-end devices accounting for the bulk of sales in emerging markets and itslack of anown-retail presence, the U.S. company is largely seen as a premium brand by consumers acrossthe region.
