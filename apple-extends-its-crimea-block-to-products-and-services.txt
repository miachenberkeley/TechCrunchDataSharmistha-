[Contact at Apple Russia in Moscow]Yours faithfully,
LLC Apple RusApples move to shut off all business with Crimea is a result of sanctions that the U.S. first published on December 19, 2014, in line with a similar move from the European Union.Crimea is a peninsulathat juts into the Black Sea with less than 2 million inhabitants, but as Ive written before, ithas become a bone of contention over tensions between Ukraine and Russia.The U.S and the EU bothinstituted the economic blocks to exertpressure on Russia, which annexed Crimea in March, 2014, as part of itsongoing conflict with Ukraine. The U.S. and Europe support Ukraine in that conflict and therefore oppose Russias annexation move.The U.S. ordersigned by President Obamacovers technology specifically alongside other goods and services, and callsfor blocks ofthe importation into the U.S.directly or indirectly, of anygoods, services, or technology from the Crimea region of Ukraine; and the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly,from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located,of any goods, services, or technology to the Crimea region of Ukraine. Other areas covered in the order include investments and immigration.While the U.S. is trying to use economic sanctions as a way of getting Russia to budge on Crimea and its overall position against Ukraine, there remains a lingering worry among somethat Ive spoken to that this conflict could potentially spill into a wider conflict with Russia itself, for example Russia retaliatingby blocking imports from U.S. companies like Apple.If something like that happened it would be a significantly bigger deal:with a population of144 million people and a strong tech culture, Russiarepresents a lot of emerging market opportunity for Apple (and others).Thesedevelopments come at a time when Apple is seeing some good traction in Russia, along with some hiccups, too.Analysts at GfK found thatApples iPhoneovertook Samsung to become the leadingsmartphonebrand in terms of value in 2014; it remains second to Samsung in unit sales.Thats come at a time when Apple has been raising its prices in the country. At one point last month Apple closed its online store as the value of the Roubleplungedbutthen reopened itwith prices up by 35%.On another front, the Russian government has been looking to tighten the reigns where digital content is concerned. Sometech companies have been facing blocks of their sites, and others have shut down operations in the wake of new Russian regulations over what kinds of content is legal, and how the governmentis able to access material in Russian and on Russian servers.
