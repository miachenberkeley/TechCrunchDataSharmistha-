As the market for virtual reality technology continues to grow, Apple has made an interesting acquisition that could further its role in the space. TechCrunch has confirmed that Apple has snapped upFaceshift, a startup basedinZurich that hasdeveloped technology to create animated avatars and other figures thatcapture a personsfacial expressions in real time.There were unconfirmed reports earlier this year of Apple buying Faceshift, but with no definitiveproof of the deal, Apple remained mum. In the meantime, we dug upfurther sources and conclusive links between the companies, and a spokesperson from Apple has todayconfirmed the acquisition withitscustomary statement:Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.From what we understand, several Faceshift employees are now working for Apple now out of Europe.Its not clear howApple intends to use Faceshifts technology, but there are a number of areas where Faceshift has been demonstrated and is already being used.Ingaming experiences, people can adoptavatars whose faces will alter based on the players actual expressions for a more immediate and realistic experience. In film production, the technology can be used to improve the process of animating characters to more closely mimic the actors facial movements. And while its not something that Faceshift appeared to focus on in its lifetime as a startup, theremay also be enterprise applications usingfacial recognitionfor identification or security purposes.Its main focus, so to speak, was on visual effects in areas like gaming and film. Ina worldwhereanimationtechnology can becostly and time-consuming to implement, the startups main product wasmarketeda game changer: Faceshift studio is a facial motion capture software solution which revolutionizes facial animation, making it possible at every desk, according to the company.Even so,the technology is also making an appearanceat the highest level of wow: its used in the latestStar Wars film to makenon-human characters more human-like in their expressions (a glimpseis at the 0:41 mark hereand pictured above).Apple itself already has patents and assets across motion capture, facial recognition and augmented reality, partly by way of threeother European acquisitions, respectivelyPrimeSense,Polar Roseand Metaio. Faceshift could complement and expand Apples capabilities in these areas going forward.Faceshift was originally founded in Zurich by academics Thibaut Weise, Brian Amberg and Sofien Bouaziz as a spinoff from the Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory at thecole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausannein Switzerland. The school originallyowned two of Faceshifts facial animation patents (here and here), which transferred to Faceshift at the end of August of this year, just ahead of Faceshift transferring much of its IP administration to firms that commonly do work for Apple.Faceshiftlater added offices on the West Coastheaded by film and gaming industry vet Doug Griffin (no longer with Faceshift), and in London. The Londonoffice isheaded up by Nico Scapel, a visual effects specialist with a long and impressive list of film credits.Prior to Apples acquisition, Faceshift had a web site that offered a demonstration of how it worked, along with some support documentation for developersusing it.You can see a basic archived version ofthe original sitehere(viaWayback Machine).There are also severalvideos on YouTube showing how Faceshiftstech worked, including this short video withinterviews produced by Intel, whose RealSense 3D camera integrated with the Faceshift SDK:
