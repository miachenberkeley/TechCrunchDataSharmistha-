At long last, Apple is adding away for people to pay for purchases on iTunes beyond credit or debit cards  a move that pointsto the companysharpeningits focuson marketingtheiPhone to a wider set of users. Apple  working first with O2/Telefonica in Germany  will nowlet people pay for items usingcarrier billing in iTunes.This means users can now pay for apps and other iTunes purchases by linking uptheir phone numbers to chargethe itemsto their mobile bills, bypassing the need for a credit or debit card, or potentially even a bank account.If you are an O2 user in Germany, you can now enter yourphone number instead of a card number into your iTunes account information. Subsequentpurchases fromApple Music, iTunes, the App Store and iBooks are thencharged directly to yourphone bill, or debited from a prepaid amount that a you haveaddedto the phone if you are not on a contract.We have contacted Apple directly for a statement, but in the meantime O2, owned by Telefonica, has confirmedthat the feature has started to get quietly rolledout across Germany and will be available to all users by next month.Telefnica Germany is working with Apple related to carrier billing, a spokesperson told us in an email. Payment via the O2 phone bill is now available for Apple Music, iTunes, App Store and iBooks Store Purchases. The service is gradually being rolled out and will be available for all O2 customers (prepaid and postpaid) in Germany by the beginning of November 2015.We were first alerted tothenew feature by Carsten Knobloch, a blogger in Germany, who tells us that the billing option appears both on the desktop iTunes app (pictured above) as well asvia his mobile app (which he has captured and sent to us, pictured below):O2 declined to say which company was providing the backend service to link up iTunes to O2s billing machine, or what the plans may be for other markets. Unfortunately right now I cannot give you more information, the spokesperson said.We have heard on the grapevine that Apple hadbeen talking with Bango, a carrier billing provider, to roll out carrierbillingfunctionality on iTunes. Bango has declined to comment on the deal, but points out that it has been working on another implementationthat lets people charge an iTunes voucher to their carriers bill, which in turn can be used to top up iTunes credit.Another source says that its not Bango working on this deal, pointing out that O2 also has a relationship with Boku, another carrier billing provider that O2has backed financially.Up to now, carrier billing players like Bango and Boku have integrated with other major app stores, barringApples. Telefonica hasbeen workingon carrier billing for years already for Android and other devices.Germany, it seems, is often used as a test market for early carrier billing services: its where Amazon had also first tested its first integration, with Bango and O2, in September of last year. If the Germany implementation is a success, its likely that the feature could be rolled out well beyond that country: Bango works with Telefonica across the whole of its 340-million user footprint.Indeed, the significance of Apple turning on carrier billing will likely be felt more in markets further afield.Carrier billing may not seem like a big deal to a lot of iPhone users in mature economies, where payment card and bank account penetration are both veryhigh.But inemerging economies, where card useis far lower and many consumers might not even have bank accounts, a phone can essentially serve as a proxy for both: mobile users cantop up their phones with cash at shops, and those phonescan then, by way of carrier billing, be used to pay for goods purchased on those devices, usually under a certain limit. Apps, music and books fall well within that limit.For Apple, it could mean that its looking for ways of making its services much more accessible to users in those emerging markets and among a wider pool of users in developed countries  targeting demographics where the iPhone and Apple have proven to be knownbrands but not nearly as widely used as Android smartphones.Its also an interesting turn of events for O2 and carriers as a whole.Operators have traditionally seen themselves as owners of the billing relationship with mobile users, and all the rich data and upselling opportunities that comealong with it.But that situation got turned on its head after Apple launched its App Store and developed its own direct billing relationship with users by way of iTunes, and others followed in Apples wake. Introducing carrier billing is one way of clawing that back, at least in part: you still have to activate the billing by way of iTunes, after all, and thats where all yourpurchases are made and your purchase history will ultimately reside.Updated with response from Bango and further partnership detail.
