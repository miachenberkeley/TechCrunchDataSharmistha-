Apple has received an extension in the timeline that it has to reply to a court order to modify an iPhone for the FBI. The deadline, originally Tuesday, has been pushed out to Friday, February 26th, TechCrunch has learned.Apple will need to make its case why the FBIs request to createa special version of iOS is burdensome and taxes the limits of the 200-year-old All Writs Act. News of the extension was previously reported by Bloomberg.Most controversially, it also wants Apple to create a new version of iOSthat allows the submission of passcodes via wireless protocol like Bluetooth or Wifi or the physical port on the device.Apple has objected in a strongly worded letter by its CEO Tim Cook, but it will now have to respond legally and a court will have to decide whether to compel it to comply.
