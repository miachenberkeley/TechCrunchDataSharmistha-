Craig Federighi, Apples senior vice president of software engineering (and one of its most popular WWDC presenters) says the FBIs demands on the company will make all iOS users more vulnerable to malicious attacks in an opinion piece for the Washington Post.Apple is currently battling a court order that would force it to create new software for the FBI so the bureaucan unlock an iPhone 5c used by one of the perpetratorsofa Dec. 2 shooting attack on a social services center in San Bernardino, California that killed 14 people. The company has said repeatedlyincluding in a public letter to customers and before a congressional Judiciary Committeethat doing so would set a precedent that could compromise the security of all iOS users.Apples stancegot reinforcement at the end of February when in a separate but legally similar case in New York, a district court judge ruled in favor of Apple by denying a government request for information on an iPhone, sayingthat the government had failed to prove it is entitled to force Apple to help it bypass the devices passcode by the All Writs Act.In his op-ed, titled The FBI wants to roll back safeguards that keep us a step ahead of criminals, Federighi wrote that fulfilling the FBIs request would force Apple to compromise its current encryption technology, negatingyears of work by the companys engineers and creating a security hole that could be exploited by criminals:Thats why its so disappointing that the FBI, Justice Department and others in law enforcement are pressing us to turn back the clock to a less-secure time and less-secure technologies. They have suggested that the safeguards of iOS 7 were good enough and that we should simply go back to the security standards of 2013. But the security of iOS 7, while cutting-edge at the time, has since been breached by hackers. Whats worse, some of their methods have been productized and are now available for sale to attackers who are less skilled but often more malicious.To get around Apples safeguards, the FBI wants us to create a backdoor in the form of special software that bypasses passcode protections, intentionally creating a vulnerability that would let the government force its way into an iPhone. Once created, this software  which law enforcement has conceded it wants to apply to many iPhones  would become a weakness that hackers and criminals could use to wreak havoc on the privacy and personal safety of us all.The ruling in this case potentially affects all tech businesses that need to safeguard sensitive customer data. Companies that have filed amicus briefs in support of Apple include Box, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Square, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The United Nations human rights commissioner has also issued a statement supporting Apple.
