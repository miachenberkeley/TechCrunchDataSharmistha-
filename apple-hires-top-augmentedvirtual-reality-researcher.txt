With all of the declarations of augmented reality and virtual realitys inevitable ascents to the heights of technological cruciality, Apple has managed to staynoticeablyquiet on the topic. Thishas ledto any VR/AR movement on their end being quite notable.According to a report from the Financial Times, Apple just hired a top AR/VR specialist to join their team. Doug Bowman, a man who quite literally wrote the book on 3D interfaces (he was the lead author of3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice), will be joining the Cupertino-based tech giant following a sabbatical from his position as a professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. He alsoserved as the general chair of the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference in 2007-2008 according to his Virginia Tech bio.Bowman, who has been employed by Virginia Tech since 1999, has published and collaborated on numerous articles relating to augmented reality and virtual reality including, Virtual Reality: How Much Immersion Is Enough?, 3D User Interfaces: New Directions and Perspectives, and The Effects of Visual Realism on Search Tasks in Mixed Reality Simulation.A quick scour of his CV indicates a laundry list of impressive accomplishments in the field of AR/VR research that will undoubtedly prove useful to Apple whichhas, in the very least, indicated interest in the AR/VR space.Healso details that his research interests include three-dimensional user interfaces, virtual environments, virtual reality, augmented reality and human-computer interaction.Unlike its competitors, including Google, Facebook (Oculus), Samsung and HTC, Apple has yet to formally announce any serious hardware or software efforts in the virtual/augmented realityfield, though patent applications and their 360-degree videos certainly show that theyve been experimenting with it. Positing what AR/VR pursuits could be next for Apple would justbe simple speculation, but it will certainly be interesting to see what comes of hires like this in the future.
