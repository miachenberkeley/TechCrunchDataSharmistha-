As part of a huge push to own the Chinese market, Apple is opening up a new store in Hong Kong. It will be located on Canton Road, which is known for shopping, on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong. The company has yet to announce an opening date, but work is already underway behind the barricade pictured above. Apple currently has 19 stores in China, and the Hong Kong location will be its 20th in the country, and the fourth in that region. Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chengdu, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Zhengzhou, and Chongqing already have at least one Apple store. Hong Kong is one of the more shopping-focused markets in China, and Apple currently has three stores in the area. Canton Road, however, is one of the more highly trafficked shopping streets in China and the world, and the new store should prove to be one of the biggest on the island. Apple has been heavily focused on building out its presence in China. First quarter earnings in 2015 showed that China represented sales of $16.144 billion, which is an increase of 157 percent from the quarter before and 70 percent from the previous year. Retail is a huge part of that push, and a store in Hong Kong only makes sense. Apple has no word on when the store will open, but you can likely expect to see more and more of a retail push in China as Apple continues to climb the charts in that market.
