ApplePay may only be available in six countries right now, but the iPhone maker is keen toextend the footprint of thedigital payment service worldwide.Thats according to Jennifer Bailey, VP of Apple Pay, who spoke to TechCrunch this week as the service expanded its presence in Singapore, where it now supports five major banks that cover over80 percent of cards, following an initial launch in April. Apple Pay is also live in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia and China,but there are plans to do a lot more.Wereworking rapidly in Asia and also in Europe, our goal is to have Apple Pay in every significant market Apple is in, Bailey told us.Apple recently announced plans to expand the payment service to Hong Kong but, that aside, it is unclear which markets will be next. Back in February, leaks suggestedthat France, Hong Kong and Brazil are on Apples expansion list for this year, while Tim Cook this month hinted India is also in Apples thinking,but the company isnt commenting on its plans.Wehave announced Hong Kong [and], across the [Asia Pacific] region, were talking to many partners andbanks and evaluating how quickly we can bring Apple Pay to new markets, former Netscape execBailey said.Apple has focused onthe most logical markets in Asia to date  China is the most populouscountry on the planet and a huge market for Apple, while Singapore and Hong Kong are small markets with many Western consumer traits and Bailey shared some insight into what Apple seeks when assessing expansions.First, we look at the size of the market for Apple products, she said. We also look at credit and debit card penetration, and [existing] contactless payment coverage.[But]when we bring Apple Pay to market even when contactless is low it will grow  it was 4 percent in the U.S. but is now 20 percent. Wealso work with our network partners, where we can utilize integration with Amex and Visa, to go to market quickly.That focus on existing Apple customers makes sense, since they are the only ones who can use the technology, but itmight rule out any immediate entry into countries in regions like Southeast Asia, where cheaper Android devices dominate Apple and others on marketshare.Either way, Bailey said she is really excited about the momentum that Apple Pay has gathered in markets where it is live.Bailey previously revealedthat the service hit three million provisions inside its first three days in China, while, more generally, it is adding one million new users per week worldwide. Bailey didnt offer new datafor Apple Pay in China, but she did say that the service is seeing incredible user and developer reception with a number of prominent consumer tech companiesintegrating the service into their apps to enable digital payments.From all indicators the launch [in China] has been really successful, she added.Apple Pay now covers 2,500 bank locations in the U.S., up from an initial six, while in China the 12 it launched with in February is now 19. Even in existing markets where Apple Pay is live, there are more updates planned soon.Beyondadding support for more banks and cards, Apple is also focused on introducing loyalty programs for Apple Pay  having completed its first rollouts in the U.S.. Likewise, Apple Pay doesnt support online/in-app payments in all markets, so that is also on the agenda.That might just be the tip of the iceberg. Earlier this year,we reported that Apple Pay is coming to ATMs in the U.S.as it aims to grab a larger slice of the payments pie.
