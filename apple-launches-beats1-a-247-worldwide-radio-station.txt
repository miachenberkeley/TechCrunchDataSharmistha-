Apples Jimmy Iovine announced Beats1, the first ever live worldwide 24-hour radio station would be coming to Apple Music at WWDC15 today.Trent Reznor called me up. He saysI got it. Lets create the worlds first 24/7 radio station. Iovine said onstage of the origins for the new global radio station. He continued explaining what it was in that raspy, guttural voice of his, saying, Broadcast from 3 cities; not based on algorithms, not based on drum beats. A station that only has one master: music itself.And I said Why do artists always have the craziest ideas that are so hard to execute? But wait a second, thats why were at Apple!The global radio station will broadcast the same sound from London, Los Angeles and New York City out to over 100 cities throughout the world.It will be led by former Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe, broadcasting from L.A. and will include DJsEbro Darden in New York and Julie Adenuga in London and will offer exclusive interviews and guest hosts.#Beats1. Worldwide. Always on. Coming soon to @AppleMusic. #WWDC15
