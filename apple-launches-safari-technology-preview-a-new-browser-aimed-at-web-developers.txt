Apple today announced its expandingits efforts in the area of web development, with the launch of a new version of its Safari web browser, designed specifically for developers. Called Safari Technology Preview, the company says this browser will allow developers to get an early look at upcoming web technologies in OS X and iOS, including things like the latest layout technologies, visual effects, and other developer tools.The idea is to allow developers to more easily get their hands on these technologies and be able to experiment, then offer feedback to Apple earlier on so the company can make the necessary improvements.Of course, Apple has for a long time offered Nightly builds of WebKit, the open source browser engine that today runs on hundreds of millions of devices and powers Apples Safari. However, getting access to these builds takes a bit more effort than using the new Safari Technology Preview browser. Instead, with the new browser, its updates are distributed every two weeks by way of the Mac App Stores software update mechanism. That means its less hassle to run a browser that features the latest advances in web technologies, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS and WebKit.Plus, the browser allows developers to access the latest versions of Web Inspector and Responsive Design Mode  the latter which is used to help developers build websites that work across devices, from desktop to mobile.Other advantages this version of Safari offers over using a Nightly build is that its signed and validated by Apple, and it works with iCloud. The lack of iCloud support, in fact, has been a pain point for web developers who wanted to use aNightly build as their primary browser. Now, theyll have a differentoption, while still being able to use their bookmarks, access their Reading List and accessthe tabs theyve opened on other devices.In addition, SafariTechnology Preview is a standalone application, meaning it can run side-by-side with the shipping version of Safari, to make it easy to switch between the two builds. (The Technology Preview version will feature a purple icon to differentiate it from the shipping version.)While the big news is the products actual launch, developers will also likely be interested to learn whats shipping in the debut version, out today. This includes a variety of first-release features, such as:While Safari Technology Preview is obviously aimed at developers, it will be accessible to anyone who wants to try it  you wont need to have a registered Apple Developer account to download the browser.For tech enthusiasts, there arestill some advantages to running this version of Safari, even if you arent a web developer.Because the browser offers the latest web technologies, there are real consumer benefits that you can see and feel as you use the web  like better performance and a richer web experience, for example.Safari Technology Preview is available today, as of 10 AM PT ondeveloper.apple.com/safari/download.
