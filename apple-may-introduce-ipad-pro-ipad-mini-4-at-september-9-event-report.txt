Apples upcoming press event, scheduled for September 9, is going to be a long one, if were choosing to believe the rumors.Alongside new iPhones and a brand new (potentially world-dominating) Apple TV 4, both of which are reported to debut at the event, we may also get an introduction to the long-rumored iPad Pro and a refreshed iPad mini, according to 9to5Macs Mark Gurman.The iPad Pro is expected to be a MacBook-sized tablet, meant for the enterprise where a larger screen could come in handy. Apple has already announced enterprise partnerships with Cisco and IBM, so a debut of the iPad Pro in the near-future makes sense.Rumors suggest that the iPad Pro will have support for a ForceTouch-based stylus as well as larger, more powerful speakers.Gurmans sources say that a pre-order campaign for the iPad Pro will begin near the end of October, with the larger iPad slated to hit stores in November.Beyond the iPad Pro, Apple is reported to have plans to unveil the iPad mini 4 at the September 9 event. According to rumors, the iPad mini 4 should be thinner, with a more powerful chipset that can support split-screen apps.
