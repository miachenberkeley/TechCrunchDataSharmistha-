Update 2:20 PM ET: Apples status page now says that the issue has been resolved.Apple and MTV were supposed to announce the Video Music Award nominees. But it looks like many Apple services are down right now, including the iOS and Mac App Store, Apple Music (and Beats1), Apple TV, the iBooks Store, many iTunes services (iTunes in the Cloud, iTunes Match, iTunes Store, iTunes U) and the Podcasts app.iCloud services are still up and running, so you should be able to save and retrieve your documents, calendar events, contacts and more.Beats1 was supposed to announce the nominees at 7 AM PT this morning, but many couldnt load the station. Its unclear whether the VMA nominations are the reason iTunes-related services are down right now. MTV sticked to its original plan and shared the nominees on Twitter when Beats1 was supposed to announce them. We will update this post as we learn more.In addition to the following table highlighting affected services, Apple wrote the following message:All Store Services  Some users are affected.
