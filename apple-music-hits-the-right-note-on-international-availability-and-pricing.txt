Its still early days for Apple Music, the newly launched streaming service, as the world chews over itsuser interface, initial service issues, that Beats 1 radio station and other unexpected factors. But twoareas where the U.S. company has hit the right notes areinternational availability and pricing.Its always surprised me how slow the music streaming industry has been to move into emerging markets. Granted, users in Asia, Africa and Latin America dont spend as much as those in Western markets, but their smartphones and tablets are their entertainment hubs, since many have limited access to TV, cable, and other offline entertainment.Everyone has music on their phone, butthe potential to go beyond downloads and MP3s  legal or otherwise  and tap into a library of millions is hugely compelling.And yet, Spotifys global footprint is still limited, as is that of Rdio and Deezer.With that in mind, its refreshing that Apple Music has gone global from day one.Beats 1 is available in 100 countries. That might sound obvious, but it is completely in contrast to ApplesiTunes Radio service, which rolled out very slowly to North America, parts of Europe and Oceaniabut no further.It isnt just about global availability though, Apple has done right on price, too.Apple Music costs from $10 for a single account in the U.S., but the company has priced its service competitively across the world. In Thailand  where Ilive it is $5 per month, as is the case in Indonesia and elsewhere, but it is even lower in other parts of the world. The service costs around $3 in the Philippines and Russia, while in India it is available for just 120 INR (less than $2) per month. (Of course, its worth pointing out that catalogue availability will vary from country to country, which is another factor forprices.)So not only is Apple Music available in a range of markets where rivalsarent  Thailand, India, Indonesia, and Russia are three markets where Spotify is absent, for example  but it is offering seriously competitive prices, with the additional option of discounted family packages.Im pleasantly surprised by Apples approach here. Of course, it makes sense to at least match your competition on price, but lets not forget that this is Apple  a company that charges top dollar for its smartphones and consequently has minor(but loyal) userbasesin many emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere in the world.The only problem right now, is that youll need to shell out $600+ to get an Apple device on which to make use of that $2 subscription in India, for example. With Android phones offering increasingly sophisticated user experiences at a fraction of the cost of an iPhone  Xiaomis new Mi4iretails for just $200in India, compared to $880 for the lowest priced iPhone 6 model the cost of hardware is the barrier for Apple Musicoutside of the West right now until the Android version arrives this fall.(Thats unless you want to use the service solely on a Windows desktop device, which rather defeats the point of paying for a cross-platform music service when there are others thatcover Android.)As for Spotify, Rdio and other streaming music contenders. Apples focus on iOSand the nascency of streamingmean the market is far from sewn up, especially in countries where Android dominates. Plus, theres certainly an argument that Apple Music is good for the industry in general since it raises awareness of music streaming among new demographics and consumers.One thing thats for sure, however, is Apple Musics global footprintfrom day one highlights the difference that the companys influenceand financial muscle(plus its know-how via the acquisition of Beats)makes when dealing with licensing and the music industry generally.
