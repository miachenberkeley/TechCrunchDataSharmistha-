Apple Music is coming tomorrow, and Apple Music Senior Director and former beats CEO Ian Rogers wants you to be ready, so he has revealed the specifics of when itll star rolling out. The official launch time for Apple Music is June 30 at 8 AM PT, per a Rogers blog post and Facebook event, at which time iOS 8.4 will be made available for users to update their devices.iOS 8.4 is required for Apple Music, which shouldnt have too much impact on adoption; Apple enjoys likely the steepest upgrade curve anywhere for OS upgrades, and its unlikely that 8.4 will run into any issues like the size constraints that prevented some from updating immediately to iOS 8 when that major new version launched.While Rogers seems to be confident about the specific timing of the launch, the traditional history of iOS updates is that the debut window for the software can encounter issues that delay availability of the software, due to things like a whole bunch of people all attempting to access the update from Apples servers at the same time.Lately, mass update roll-out has gone more smoothly than in previous years, probably due to investment Apple has made in its cloud capabilities and infrastructure through data center expansion. Remember this is a streaming service enabled by an update made available OTA, though, so plan for some delays just in case.Apple Music is launching with a three-month free trial (the subject of some controversy recently) and its also getting a streaming radio service called Beats 1, which features artists hosting programming sections as well as a team of full-time DJs headed by ex-BBC host Zane Lowe.
