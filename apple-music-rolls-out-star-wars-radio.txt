The latest to join the fray is Apple, which has today added a new Star Wars-themed radio station to its streaming music service, Apple Music.The station, now appearing under Apple Musics Featured section, includes selected tracks from the soundtracks of previous films, including the prequels, so that you can enjoy the perfect music to accompany you on your journey to the premiere.Apples station has all the memorable tunes from the past movies, including the main title theme, the trash compactor scenes score, andthe Emperor Arrivesmusic,for example, which are interrupted by various sound effects, like Darth Vadersbreathing or R2-D2s beeps.The station is available on Apple Music on both Mac and PC as well as on mobile devices and Apple TV. However, some international users are reporting that they dont see the station appearing in their own countries, which indicates this may be a U.S.-only launch.Inaddition to the new station, Apple is also offering the soundtrack to the new film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, for pre-order on iTunes and is selling a Star Wars collection of digital movies for the limited-time price of $89.99 for the HD bundle.Apple is hardly the only tech company helping to promote the highly anticipated movieand boosting its own bottom line in the process.
