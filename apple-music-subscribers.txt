During an earnings call marked by a lot of less than stellar news, Apple CEO Tim Cook did manage to locate some bright spots in the companys ever-expanding portfolio. Among them was a steady increase in paying Apple Music subscribers.That number has surpassed 13 million, up from the 11 million announced by execs Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi back in February. Of course, the number still pales in comparison to the 800-pound streaming gorilla that is Spotify.Last month CEO Daniel Ek tweetedthat the reigning champ of online music had hit the 30 million mark.Still, its steady growth for the service formerly known as Beats. At least we know that neither Taylor Swift (nor her stunt double) suffered in vain.
