Symptoms your machine may be exhibiting if its affected include video distortion, lack of video or image despite a powered-on computer, or unexpected system restarts.Only in the case of a Mac actually showing these symptoms should you contact Apple to take advantage of the repair program, since otherwise you most likely dont have a problem.Apple has generally been very good about extending warranties when it finds more system problems affecting models out of warranty.
