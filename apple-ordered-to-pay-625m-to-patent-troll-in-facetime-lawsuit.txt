Apple has been ordered to pay $625 million to notorious patent troll VirnetX after a U.S. court judged that the iPhone-maker had infringed on patents used in its iMessage and FaceTime services.VirnetX, which is commonly referred to as a troll because it makes almost of itsrevenue from patent licensing and lawsuits, has sued a number of tech companies over the past decade. Itsettled a 2014dispute with Microsoft over patents used in Skype, pocketing $24 million in the process, and made$200 millionfrom the Redmond-based company via a 2010 case.The jury saw what we have been saying all along: Apple has been infringing VirnetXs patented technology for years, the legal firm that represents VirnetX said in a statement.Apple said it would appeal the decision. The company argued thatthe patents in question are not valid.We are surprised and disappointed by the verdict and were going to appeal. Our employees independently designed this technology over many years, and we received patents to protect this intellectual property. All four of VirnetXs patents have been found invalid by the patent office. Cases like this simply reinforce the desperate need for patent reform, itsaid in a statement.Nevada-basedVirnetX previously won $368 million from Apple in 2013 when a U.S. court adjudged that it infringed on patents used inFaceTime and its VPN service inside iOS.Apple later tweaked its services, but VirnetX argued that the changes werent enough.In addition to Apple and Microsoft,VirnetX has taken on Cisco, Avaya, Siemens and others for allegedpatent violations.
