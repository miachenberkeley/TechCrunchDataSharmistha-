Ever wonder how much one makes as the head of Apple?Good news! Since Apple is a public company, thats public information. They updated their charts for last year just this morning.Heres how it all broke down in 2014:This doesnt factor in any net worth gained on Apple stock each exec already owned  and given that Apple stock did nothing but climb in 2014, thats likely a huge chunk of cash in its own right.You can find Apples Executive Compensation table on page 40 of this document.tl;dr: some made more than others, but all of them made more than most can begin to imagine.
