The CIAhas been involved in a multi-year effort to break through Apples security code, according to a new report fromthe Intercept.Top secret documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden reveal a CIA-sponsored annual gathering called Jamboree where researchers presented the latest tactics at cracking the security code of Apples iPhones, iPads and proprietary developer tools.The report provides a total of 10 presentation slides detailingefforts to weaken the security of Apples products. One such slide describes the creation of a dummy version of Xcodethat would be targeted atmost likely innocent developers in order toentice all MacOS applications to create a remote backdoor on execution.Another reveals efforts toembed surveillanceand counter-surveillance for iOS devices (note the British Government Communications Headquarterslogo and the reference to the WARRIOR PRIDE program that wasrevealedby Snowden last year on this slide):The most troubling part is the revelation that the CIA has targeted App Store developers  a vast majority of whom were US citizens in 2010  to compromise their computers and install software that would then install back doors in all of those developers products, security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski told TechCrunch. This is very direct evidence of the government weakening commercial technologies and likely violating a number of laws by attacking innocent software developers, he said.The slidesdontreveal any successful operations, but the practicecould potentially create security weaknesses within everyday appsused bymillions of iPhone and iPad users, as well as compromise the security of every app made by targeted developers.Even more troublesome is the kind of data the CIA was supposedly extracting from these devices. According to one slide, itwas attempting to extract GID keys, not UID keys. UID keys allow access to an individuals data on one phone. Its something youd want access to if you were trying to track a terrorist, according to Zdziarski. However, the GID256-bit key is shared by all devices with the same application processor.So what that tells me is that the CIA was NOT interested in getting to encrypted personal data on individual devices, but was instead interested in cooking their own low-level boot firmware to install across an entire product line of devices, Zdziarski said.This sort of technique could be used for widespread mass surveillance, nottargeted surveillance against one group of individuals, according to Zdziarski.This isjust one accusation in a series of damning allegations against the NSA and cooperating security agencies. TheNSA worked in conjunction with theBritish equivalent organization Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to steal SIM encryption keys, according to an earlier report from the Intercept.This latest accusation alsocomes on the heels of other news that Wikimedia is suing the NSA over mass surveillance.The CIA did not respond to a request for comment about this story.
