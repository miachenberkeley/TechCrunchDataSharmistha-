Apple has just released its fiscal Q1 2015 earnings, reporting $74.6 billion in revenue, $18 billion in net profit representing $3.06 per share. This is the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time, above Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 29.5 percent in revenue, and 47.8 percent in EPS (adjusted for the 7-for-1 split).Fortunes consensus among analysts was for Apple to report earnings of $2.68 per share on $68.71 billion in revenue, with both revenue and EPS exploding more than 19.3 percent and 29.3 percent respectively  this is an insane growth prediction. In particular, analysts expected iPhone sales to drive the companys performance. But these expectations were nowhere near todays crazy quarterly earnings.The iPhone is this quarters clear winner. Tim Cook reported during the earnings call that this quarter represented the highest number of new iPhone users and the highest switch rate from an Android phone to an iPhone.Apples own guidance from its last earnings release predicted between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion billion in revenue, with gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent percent. Apples guidance has been accurate for the past year and a half, with the upper end of the forecast very close to what it actually reported. But this time, Apple was too conservative and easily beat its own guidance.Wed like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple products soar to an all-time high, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in the release.
