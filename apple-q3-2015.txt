Apple has just released its fiscal Q3 2015 earnings, reporting $49.6 billion in revenue, $10.7 billion in net profit representing $1.85 per share. Compared to the year-ago quarter, it corresponds to a growth of 32.5 percent in revenue and an impressive 44.5 percent jump in EPS.

Apples guidance has been accurate for the past couple of years, except for the past two quarters. At the time, Q1 2015 was the largest corporate quarterly earnings of all time, and even Apple couldnt predict that. While Q2 2015 wasnt as big, it was largely above Apples guidance and the streets expectations.During this quarter, Apple also launched Apple Music.

Last quarter was a massive quarter when it comes to sales in China. It was Chinese New Year, revenue soared 71 percent. Many expect the Apple Watch to work well on the Chinese market, but the iPhone is still a massive success already, driving the companys bottom line.
