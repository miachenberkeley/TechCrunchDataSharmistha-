Apple just introduced a few new updates to the Apple Pay service at the WWDC conference in San Francisco. Alongside adding your usual debit and credit cards, Apple Pay now lets you add store cards as well as loyalty and rewards cards.With the help of PassBook, the Apple Pay also knows exactly which card you need when youre in a given store and presents the right option. That said, the company decided to rename the Passbook app to Wallet.Kohls, JC Penney and BJs will be the first retailers on the platform to offer Apple Pay compatibility with their own store credit cards. Beyond that, Kohls, Walgreens and Dunkin Donuts will be bringing rewards cards to the Apple Pay platform.This comes alongside a major expansion to Apple Pay, which is headed to the UK and will soon be compatible with 70 percent of the UKs debit and credit cards. Plus, Apple has just announced a new partnership with Square, which will release a new card reader that will let small businesses take Apple Pay payments and credit card chip payments (no card swipes, however).
