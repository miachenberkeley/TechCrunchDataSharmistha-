Apple today is unveiling an overhaul to its App Store developer website, a resource available to the 11 million registered developers worldwide whohave helpedgrow the App Store to now more than 1.5 million applications. The updated site will include new articles and videosaimed at helping developers better understand how to grow their businesses and engage users. For example, some of the topics will include things like getting an app discovered on the App Store, using freemium business models (meaning, free with optional upgrades to a paid tier) and how to engage users via app updates.These articles and guides are arriving at a time when its become increasingly more difficult for App Store developers to get their new applications noticed amid a sea of competitors, and when industry insiders suspect we may have reached a point of app fatigue.Apple is clearly aware of the problem, as Bloomberg last week reported the company has been quietly exploring waysto revamp the App Store, and was evenconsidering features that would allow developers to pay to have their app promoted in search  a model similar to Googles.Of course, theres no doubt the App Store economy has had an impact over the years  Apple says it has paid $40 billion to developers since the store opened, and the App Store is responsible for some1.9 million U.S. jobs.But the App Stores middle class has been shrinking, somesay.Thats why it makes sense that Apple is now rolling out more educational resources to its developer site to help address theseconcerns.The contenton the new site will include a mix of more straightforward how-tos and explanations  like the Discovery on the App Store article which details how editorial collections work and how Apple selects apps to feature  while others will be more of an article-format case study. For example, in the Releasing App Updates article, Slack, Smule and BuzzFeed share how they plan their roadmaps and release their updates to re-engage existing users andattract new ones.Other topics will include Choosing a Business Model, User Acquisition Marketing with App Analytics and Choosing a Category. Combined, they offer guides to running a real app business aimed at generating revenue. Developers will also be able to submit apps for feature consideration through the new site.In addition to the articles, the App Store site will now includea case study video series called Developer Insights, which will involve having some of the more successful developers sharing their knowledge on various topics.For example, one video from a company called Seriously, whose first game Best Fiends surpassed 1.5 million daily users and gained a million social media followers in its first year, will focus on using social media to build a brand and community.Another video from Evernote will highlight the approach the productivity software maker took to localize its app for Japan.Localization, obviously, is a key topictodays App Store developers should understand, especially given the opportunity to reach non-U.S. users in the No. 2 and No. 3 countries for iOS App Store revenue, China and Japan.The newdeveloper resources are being rolled out now, but the collection will be expanded in the future.
