The next major update toApples mobile operating system since the debut of version 9.0 released in September, is now rolling out. In iOS 9.1, Apple is introducing a number of new features and improvements, including one involvingthose GIF-like Live Photos. However, the addition that most users will be excited about is iOS 9.1s inclusion of new emoji characters  yes, including the middle finger.Also rolling out now are updates to watchOS for Apple Watches, and an update for OS X El Capitan, both of which will receive the new emoji, too.The emoji are based on standards set by the Unicode Consortium, to be clear, so this update is about Apple moving to support the new standard  not Apples independent decision to include an expanded emoji set, and in the case of the rude gesture, possiblycontroversial  characters.The middle finger gesture is probably the most-desired among users  Emojipedia noted it has been the #1 emoji on its site for the past 12 months.However, the updated standardadditionally includes a number of other in-demand characters and images, such asnew foods likea taco, hot dog, cheese, pepper, popcorn, champagne bottle, and burrito, for example; animals like a turkey, crab, squirrel, lion, unicorn, and others; more religious symbols like prayer beads and places of worship; more faces, like an upside-down smiley, one with $ symbols for eyes, a robot face, a bandaged face, a thinking face, and others; a few extrasports emojis; more weather emojis; more landscapes; and a lot more.The other significant consumer-facing change in iOS 9.1 is an update for Live Photos. These are the images that, when pressed using the iPhone 6s and 6s Pluss 3D Touch function, animate like a video (or a Harry Potter-like photo!). Now, says Apple, the iPhone will sense when its being raised on lowered so it wont record those extra movements. For anyone whos been playing around with Live Photos on their new devices as I have will welcome this change, as you would often accidentally record video of your phone pointed at the floor,or just away from the subject matter.9.1 also introduces other compatibility updates for the soon-to-be released 4th generation Apple TV and new iPad Pro, plus other bug fixes, security fixes, and improvements, as per usual, along with performance enhancements. And theres a new setting for Messages that lets you disable Contact Photos via a toggle switch.iOS 9.1 is rolling out now as an over-the-air update to all current iOS 9 users.Just ahead of its release, Apple updated its App Store Distribution page to show iOS 9s current adoption rate, which has risen to 61 percent. Thats up from the 51 percent reported closer to the beginning of the month. iOS 8 accounts for another 30 percent of iOS devices, the chart indicates.Full Changelogs, below:Besides the iOS 9.1 release, Apple also rolled out watchOS 2.0.1, a more minor update with several changes and bug fixes.
