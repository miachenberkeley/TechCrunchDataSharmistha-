Apple is set to start finally selling the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus without SIMs, completely unlocked in the U.S., according to 9to5Macs reliable Mark Gurman. The SIM-free version of the iPhone has been available in the stores of other countries before now, but a debut stateside would be the first time its officially unlocked and without any carrier ties or SIM since its launch this past fall.The T-Mobile version of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is not locked into any specific contract, and will work with SIMs from other carriers, but the latest flagship smartphone from Apple still technically cant be bought SIM-free through official channels in the U.S.Pricing wont change either, according to Gurman, meaning the iPhone 6 will range from $649 to $849 depending on storage choices, and the iPhone 6 Plus will go from $749 to $949 unlocked and SIM free. Storage options with this generation include 16, 64 and 128GB options, as Apple dropped the 32GB tier and began offering the new top of the range with its newest, larger screen phones.Unlocked sales generally follow a few months after the initial launch, so the timing here isnt surprising. And since, functionally speaking, the T-Mobile version is effectively the same thing, not much changes for consumers  but its still one of the notable markers in an iPhones lifespan, and a reminder that the 6 and 6 Plus have already been around for a while now.
