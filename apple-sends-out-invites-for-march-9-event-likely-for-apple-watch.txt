Apple has issued invites for a new media event on March 9, with the tagline Spring Forward, which likely refers to time, hence the Apple Watch is a good guess for the star of the show. The event kicks off at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco beginning at 10 a.m. on Monday, March 9, and we should get more details regarding the April launch window for Apples first wearable, which Tim Cook alluded to in Apples most recent earnings call.The Apple Watch is the most likely candidate for discussion here, as Apple has also reportedly been inviting select Apple Watch app developers to Cupertino for special sessions in preparation for a device launch showcase of sorts. Other potential announcements could include MacBook Air or iPad developments, based on recent rumors, though it seems likely that Apple wants to highlight its very first wearable, which broke cover at the September iPhone launch event, and it might not want other devices to share the stage. Note also that Daylight Savings Time begins on March 8, the day before this event.We already know the Apple Watch will come in three distinct lines, with a variety of options within each. The Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition will be priced lower and higher in that order, with the Watch Sport starting things off at $349. We also know the Apple Watch will be a touch device, with a new kind of haptic feedback and a digital crown, and apps that essentially run remotely from a connected iOS device. Its also thoughtto have a battery that can last approximately a day with normal, mixed used.This event will almost certainly give us specifics regarding pricing of individual models, as well as when we can expect it to become available both for pre-order and in stores. Well also probably get specific battery expectations, and a better idea of whats coming in terms of both first- and third-party apps.TechCrunch will be live on the scene in San Francisco to bring you all the info as its announced by Apple.
