Apple has just issued invites for its next press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Like in previous years, the event is going to happen on June 13 at 10 AM PT on the first day of WWDC. As always, its unclear what the company is going to announce. But there are some likely possibilities.First, Apple should unveil iOS 10 and maybe OS X 10.12. WWDC is a developer conference after all, so it makes sense to showcase the latest software innovations in front of a room full of developers. tvOS and watchOS could also receive an update.One of the key features of iOS 10 could be a much improved Siri assistant. This version 2 of Siri could be able to understand context and follow-up questions. It would come with an SDK so that you can trigger complex actions like on the Amazon Echo.But the company has also used this opportunity to make other announcements. In particular, there are rumors about new MacBook Pro laptops. These laptops could feature a TouchID sensor, an OLED mini screen above the keyboard as well as the new Intel Skylake processors.Apples external displays havent been updated for years. It would make sense to unveil new retina displays at WWDC as developers love gigantic displays. And why not a Mac Pro update as well?Rumor has it that Apple has been working on a big App Store refresh with better discoverability and more options for developers. The company may also talk about Apple Music as it still needs more work.Theres one thing for sure. Its unlikely that Apple is going to showcase a new iPhone. The company usually unveil a new iPhone at a separate September event. Well have a team on the ground to liveblog the event and cover all the news.
