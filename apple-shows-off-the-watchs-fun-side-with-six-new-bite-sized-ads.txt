Apple just unveiledsix new 15-second Watch ads highlighting the instantaneous utility that the device offers. The adsfeature color gradient backgrounds, pop tunes and beautiful people wearing Apple Watches.These ads are a bit of a departure from the previousmore cinematic Watch ads that have focused largely on the emotional integration of the device into users lives. Instead,these ads are playful and punchy, and show a visual style more evocative of the silhouette iPod commercials of the 2000s, albeit now with more hipstermain characters.These ads signal somewhat of a value shiftin Apples Watchadvertising as the product matures and the company looks to showcase itsutility a bit more seriously. The ads also highlight the fact that the best use casesof the device are generally in the moment and may only grab a users attention for a fraction of a second.Notably all six of these ads, titled Ride, Sing, Date, Train, Sprinkle and Cycle, highlight features that have been available on the Watch since its release, an interesting move given the recent watchOS 2 updatethat addednative Watch app integration.Check out the rest of the newadsfrom Apple below.
