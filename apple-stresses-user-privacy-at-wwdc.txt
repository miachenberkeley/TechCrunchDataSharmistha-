Apple is continuing to put blue waterbetween itself and data-mining mobile rivals such asGoogle by engineering its services with a clearfocus onuser privacy.At ApplesWWDC developer conference today, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi showed off an update to its Siri voice assistant, called Proactive, which will offer some Google Now-esque predictive features, such as suggestions for when a device userneeds to leave to get to an event in their schedule, or inferring who might be calling from a landline number thats not stored in your contacts, based on parsing data from your email.But where Google Now doescloud-based processing of user data (and Google data-mines the personal information it gets access to build detailed user profiles to sell ad-targeting intelligence to advertisers), Apple is doing this data processinglocally on the device.Apple said user data that powers its Proactive service remainsanonymous, isnot linked to the usersApple ID or shared with third parties, and remainson the device.This is a defining difference versuscloud-companies building big data-mining businesses.Yep, Apple went with local processing to offer its 'Proactive', intelligent Google Now alternative in iOS 9 https://t.co/tM8wqwnSJw Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) June 8, 2015We dont mine youremail, yourphotos or your contacts in the cloud to find things out about you all of this is done on device under your control, saidFederighi.We do it in a way that does not compromise your privacy we honestly just dont want to know. All of this is done on the device.While Apples pro-privacy approachoffers a clear contrast to how many currentcloudbusinesses handle and data-mine user data, the most obvious strategic target is Google. Ultimately this isApple highlighting thecore, underlying difference betweeniOSand Android  given how much feature overlap remains between the two mobile OSes.Googles ad-fueled business model absolutely requiresmassive data-mining of users. Apple, by contrast, makes the majority of its revenue from sellinghardware  so the clear message coming out ofCupertino is: we can afford to protect your privacy.Google recently revamped its Photos app, making much of a natural language feature that lets users locate particular photos by searching for generic terms, but not mentioning the background tradeoff  i.e. thatGoogle will also be searchingandcataloguing your photos and photo metadata in order to further flesh out what it knows aboutyou.Today Federighishowed off a similar photo search featureon iOS demoing how userscan say things to Siri like show me my photos from last July and have it pull up the correctimages. So again, theres obvious feature overlap, but behind the scenes the Apple versusGoogle philosophy about handling user data is very different.In another instance during todays keynote, Apple noted that its incoming Flipboard-clone News app will not be sharing users reading habits with third parties  or with Apple itself.
