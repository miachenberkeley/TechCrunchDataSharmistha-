Apple has topped smartphone shipment numbers in China in Q4 2014, according to analyst firm Canalys. The popularity of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus helped push the California gadget-maker ahead of its homegrown competitors, seeing it ship more than Xiaomi and Huawei, and putting it out in front of Samsung, which placed third overall. Canalys credits the large screen of the newest smartphone models, along with proper support for Chinas LTE networks, good launch timing, and a crackdown on gray market exports from the nearby Hong Kong market for the iPhones significant win in the key Chinese market.This makes the first time Apple has led the rankings of smartphones as measured by devices shipped according to Canalys. Its a tremendous feat considering that most of its handsets come in at almost twice the retail cost of flagship hardware from competitors like Xiaomi, which has itself proved a formidable presence in the Chinese smartphone ecosystem. Xiaomi became the leader in Chinas smartphone market in Q2 2014, per the research firm, pushing Samsung down the list.Samsungs slide is another key takeaway from this new report, as the Korean device maker continues to struggle to find positive growth for its global smartphone efforts.
