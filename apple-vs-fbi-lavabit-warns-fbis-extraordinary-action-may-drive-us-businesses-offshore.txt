Another amicus brief has been filed in support of Apple in its legal battle with theFBI over the measures it is beingordered,by a court writ, to take to help the agency break into a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. Apple is keeping an update list of amicus briefs and letters of support filed with the court here.This time the amicus briefhas been submittedbyLavabit, a technology company that previously judged it necessary to shutter itsown serviceafter receiving similarly extraordinary government demands for assistance to access user data, in the wake of the 2013 disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.The former encrypted email service had apparently been used by Snowden for private email communications but shut down its services in August 2013to avoid being forced to compromise user data, with founder Ladar Levison saying at the time:I would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.In itsamicus briefin support of Apple, published on Friday, the company detailsthe extraordinary assistance it was compelled to provide by the government back in 2013  noting that the FBI sought itsprivate encryption key, which would have enabledthe agencyto perform man in the middle attacks as a method for obtaining user data. the FBI sought the private encryption key used by Lavabit to protect the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections to their servers.With the SSL/TLS private key in hand, the FBI would be able to impersonate Lavabit on the Internet. This would allow them to intercept, decrypt, inspect, and modify (either with intent, or by accident) all of the connections between Lavabit and the outside world, Lavabit writes.In the same vein, the government now seeks extraordinary assistance from Apple, Lavabitasserts, joining the chorus of voices arguing that the FBIs demandfar exceeds the scope of the All Writs Act and violates the rights guaranteed to Apple under the United States Constitution.The governments extraordinary request eviscerates the purpose of the All Writs Act, and unnecessarily compromises the proprietary intellectual property of a private company that has not been implicated, in any way, with the crime under investigation, Lavabitadds.Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes If Congress had intended that private entities and individuals be forced to provide such extraordinary assistance to government investigations, Congress would have passed a law to that extent.(To be clear, Lavabitsimplication is that the typeof assistance being sought by the FBI in the San Bernardino iPhone case is similarly extraordinary to the earlier FBI action in its case, even though the route the agencyis seeking to take now against Apple is different, given it is not asking Apple to hand over its private encryption key but rather to create a security-weakened version of its OS on demand. But then Apples higher profile vs Lavabit makes it rather harder for the FBI to out-and-out ask forencryption keys in this case.)Lavabitgoes on to warn the governmentsaction risks damaging Applestrusted brand and reputation, as well as the reputations ofthird party companies providing secure services via the iOS platform.And if the Apple brand becomes mistrusted by its users as a result of government action, Lavabitmakes the point thatthat could have a wider impact on iOS users security since usersmay no longer trust routine security updates sent byApple.Automatic updates are often criticalto iOS security because they fix new vulnerabilities, it notes. Because consumers trust Apple, many iPhone owners have these automatic updates turned on. If the government is successful, however, many consumers may not be as trustful of these updates because of a fear (actual or imagined) that the updates will contain malware to provide a backdoor into the data on their iPhones. The result is that fewer people will automatically accept the automatic updates and the overall security of iPhones across the country will suffer.Lavabitalso warns the FBIs action against Apple could ultimately triggeran exodus of US companies seeking toavoid similar reputational damage.Such precedence would likely result in many businesses moving their operations offshore, therefore, making it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain even ordinary assistance from such companies, itwrites in the brief.On that front, another secure encrypted comms company, Silent Circle, moved its global headquarters from the Caribbean to Switzerlandback in May 2014 citing the latters strong privacy laws asone of the reasons to headquarter itsbusiness in Europe. Variousother pro-encryption startups, includingProtonMailand Tutanota, have also chosen to locatetheir businesses incountries in Europe that have a reputation for protecting privacy.
