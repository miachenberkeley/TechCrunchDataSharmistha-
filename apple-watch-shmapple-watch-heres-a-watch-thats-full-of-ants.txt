Assume, for sanitys sake, that this isnt an April Fools joke. If we begin our exploration of the Ant Watch on that basis we are able to suspend, for a moment, our disbelief and consider deeply and truly the madness of wearing a watch full of ants on your wrist.And that is just what this is: a watch containing ants. You feed said ants a little sugar every few weeks and they live within the watch, busily making tunnels in a shake-resistant container, while you examine their activities like a great dead-eyed god.Some information is in order. From the site:This watch is obviously not for children.But I ask you, friends, at what point in your life did you look at your wrist and say Huh. Ants? In what universe will you be allowed to put ants into a fridge? What strange delirium could cause you to leave live ants on your bedside table as you sleep? While ants are not intrinsically dangerous I believe that they are inherently creepy and the further from our delicate parts the better is the rule of the day.That said, perhaps youre the kind of person who wants a watch full of ants. The watch  which does not tell time  costs $59 and includes a years worth of real ants shipped to your home. Presumably you can replace the ants with maggots or cockroaches once you run out. Lets see Tim Cook beat that.
