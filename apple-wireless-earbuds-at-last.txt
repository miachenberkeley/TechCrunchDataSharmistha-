Apple continueslooking at ways to improve its earbuds  includingpotentially ditching the iconic white cables whichhad such a starring role in iTunes ads, back in the day.According a patent filed in February last year but published this week and spotted byAppleInsider, Cupertino is looking atmaking wireless earbuds thatalso incorporate bone-conduction technology in order to improve voice communications. The patent alsodescribesdeploying a range of other sensors  such as internal microphones and accelerometers  to better detect externalnoise to boostnoise-canceling capabilities and enhance the in-ear audio experience.The patent application, entitled System and method of improving voice quality in a wireless headset with untethered earbuds of a mobile device, detailsvarious configurations of in-earbud sensors for enhancing noise-canceling technology.Inertial sensors are used to detect vibrations in the users vocal chords, via the vibrations of the bones and tissues of their head, while internal microphones and processors detect wind levels and external noise.The multi-sensor configurations then utilizea combination of these wind/noise and voice signals to determine how to tweak audio levels to improve overall audio quality.Its not the first earbud-related bone conductionpatent from Apple. The company filed a very similar patent back in March 2013 (which we covered last year)  albeit its yet to bring an implementation of thetechnology to theearbuds it ships with iOS devices.Applefrequently files patents relating to earbuds, including another sensor-packed variant last year for power-efficient noise canceling; a variant with beamforming mics that can redirect towards the sourceof a users voice;earbuds with built-in activity, health and fitness trackers;and a set of earbuds that can automatically detect when its being shared by two users and switch between stereo and mono sounds to allow two users to hear two different audio streams.Given itsbusiness continued core focus on music, including the$3 billion acquisition of the Beats brandlast year, its hardlysurprising Appleis a little obsessive about seeking outnew ways to tweak itsprimary audio delivery mechanism (aka its EarPods).Whats perhaps more surprising is how (relatively) little the earbuds Apple ships with its mobile devices have changed over the years, despite all itsinventive whiteboarding.But given how many earbud patents are floating around now it surely cant be long before some of these sensor-based smartsfind their way into iOS users ears.
