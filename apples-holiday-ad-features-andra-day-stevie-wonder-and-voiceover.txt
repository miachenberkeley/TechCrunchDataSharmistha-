Apple just shared its holiday video ad, named Someday at Christmas, ahead of Thanksgiving in the U.S. and the holiday season. Surprisingly, it doesnt showcase Apples latest and greatest products. Instead, it focuses on music and family time. It also features Andra Day and Stevie Wonder.The two artists sing around a piano with various shots of kids opening presents and families gathering for the holidays. The only Apple products you can see is a MacBook at the very beginning and an Apple Watch. The Apple logo appears for a fraction of a second at the very end of the ad, showing that the focus isnt on Apples brand.Interestingly, we can see Stevie Wonder using Garange Band on his Mac at the beginning of the video and using VoiceOver. This feature tells you whats on your screen and what you can do. Apples efforts when it comes to accessibility stand out as many tech companies still lag behind on this front. One of the most fascinating workshops at WWDC was the VoiceOver presentation.Its easy to forget how important accessibility tools can be when you dont rely on them every day. And the brief VoiceOver demo in todays ad is a nice touch. It shows that Apples work shouldnt be just about selling more devices. ResearchKit is another example of that.Heres the video:
