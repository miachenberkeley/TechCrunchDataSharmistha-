Apples newest addition to the iPhone family may be its cheapest phone yet at$399, but the four-inch iPhone SEisnt likely to move the needle in emerging markets, where the lions share of growth in the handset industry lies.A report from Gartner found thatglobal smartphone sales have reachedtheir slowest growth rate since 2008 as smartphone saturation sets in, particularly in Western markets. That general slowdown, which has been impacted by China, has sent many phone companies in search of growth potential in nascent markets like India, Southeast Asia and Latin America  regions were consumers are particularly price sensitive but smartphone volumes are rising.Apple has faced many calls from investors and industry watchers to release a more wallet-friendly device to capture new users in such growth markets, but the iPhone SE is not that phone. Apple is never likely to move into the mass market bracket of places like India, where the majority ofhandset volume issub-$100, but the new release does offer something new.The iPhone SE marriesthe innards of Apples top-of-the-rangeiPhone 6S, including the same12-megapixel cameraand 4K video capture, with afour-inch form factor atsnip of the $549 starting price of the 6S.Thats unlikely to make a dent in China, where the market has long moved to larger, phablet-sized devices which are preferred for video, entertainment and other such activities. Apples previous stab at a mid-range phone  the ill-fated iPhone 5c  didnt go down well in China where it was perceived ascheap. The iPhone SE has evoked a similar reaction in China, where users of microblogging site Weibo have christened it The Red iPhone, in homage to Xiaomis Redmi sub-$100 affordable range, the Wall Street Journal reported.The iPhone SE may not satisfymainstream tastes in China, but it may have more luck in India.At the iPhone SE launch event yesterday Apple revealed that it sold 30 million iPhone 5s units last year alone, and thedevice  first launched in 2013and clearly the model for the iPhone SE  performed particular well in India.When Apple lowered the iPhone 5s price in Q4 2014 to nearly $300 [from an initial $500], [its] contribution [to the total number of iPhone sales in India] went up from single digits to nearly 43 percent,Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, told TechCrunch in an interview.That rise in demand showed that Indian consumers are willing to lock themselves into the Apple ecosystem even if it involved buying atwo-year-old phone,Pathak added.Putting more advanced technology into that same form factor at asimilarly low price could offerthe best of allworlds, but Pathak isnt quite sobullish on the iPhone SE. Thats because the bigproblem for Apple is price. The iPhone SE thatis billedas starting at $399willsellfrom around $599 in India.Higher pricing for Apple products isnt new in India.Thanks to taxes and other fees, India was the most expensive country to buy an iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus last year. Apple, whichsells in India via channel partners since it isnt permitted to run its own retail business in the country, subsequently cut costs, but, in a price sensitive market with much competition, the markup may cut intothe phones potential.A highly specced iPhone at $300 may be a snip, but once a device is priced around $500 it requires a buyer with a certain levelof spending power. Inevitably, at $500, that person has the capacity to spend a little more and, since many inAsia are moving towards larger devices, that means less of a need to compromise screen size for price.Indeed, Apples own portfolio couldprovide competition to its new phone.Because the price of the iPhone 6 [and iPhone 6 plus] already dropped in India, Apple is directly competing with itsown phone which mightbe more appealing to consumers, IDC analystKiranjeet Kaur told TechCrunch, referencing the fact that, like China, Indian consumers are increasingly interested in larger screen iPhones.The iPhone SE compared to the iPhone 6S plusThe iPhone 6 retails at upwards of $649 brand new in India, thats not a lot more, while apre-used model could cost hundreds of dollars less.Counterpoints Pathak said Apple is applying for a license to sell the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plusrefurbished in India, an eventuality thatcould see the devices retail from stores for around the same price that the iPhone SE currently occupies in India. (Apple has also applied for its own retail stores in India, whichwould give it greater price control.)When faced with the choice of a larger phone for the same price as the iPhone SE, analysts believe aspirational consumers may choose the latter. Or, at least, that there is a decision will impact Apples new phone.In emerging countries, we are not very convinced that [the iPhone SE]will generate volume, Pathak said. His firm, Counterpoint Research, estimates that Apple has around 4.5 million active iPhones in India, just a fraction of Indias billion-plus population, while its sales arenearly 15 times lower than China.Itmay be a short growth spurt not a long-term one, IDCs Kaur said, slightly more optimistically of the new iPhone. But Idont believe it will create a new segment for Apple in emerging markets.There is some cause for optimism though, as part of Appleswider efforts.CounterpointsPathak is of the belief that the new device, while unlikely to be universally appealing, may entice some new price-conscious users to Apple.People in India are aspirational. Those locked into the ecosystem via a low price device may upgrade later. Thats an important market for Apple.In two, three or four years, thesame young population will have increased affordability, he said.The device is likely to perform better in Western countries, where fewer consumers desire large screened phones and many have held on to the iPhone 5s in the face of newer product releases from Apple. The iPhone SE would give them a taste of Apples newest technology  such as Touch ID  without forcing them to adopt a new form factor.But price is unlikely to be a key motivator in markets like the U.S., where consumers typically choose either high-end premium devices or budget phones. The move away from fully subsidized devices could play in the iPhone SEs favor but, then again, U.S. consumers are adopting monthly payment plans for their phones which enables them to buy more expensive flagship devices as they do with contract deals.Just banking primarily on small phone lovers in the West might notequate to volume either.Consumer Intelligence Research told Recodethat it expects Apple to sell fewerthan six million iPhone SE units in its first year, with the companyshigh-end offerings likely to bemore appealing to consumers.Article updated to correct that Apples sales in India are nearly 15x lower than in China.
