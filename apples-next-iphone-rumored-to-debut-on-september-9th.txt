Im not a betting man  but if someone were to say Quick! When will Apple announce the next iPhone?! Id say September. Its just what they do.Sure enough: word around the rumor mill is now that the next announcement will come on September 9.No official invites have been sent out yet, but the quite-often-correct John Paczkowski is saying that Apple is planning an event for the week of September 7, with the 9th currently looking most likely.Whatever might they announce at this special event?The iPhone 6 was announced in September 2014.The iPhone 5s was announced in September 2013.The iPhone 5 was announced in September 2012.You can see where Im going here. If Apple is to debut an iPhone in 2015, itll probably happen in September.These dates also line up with previous rumors that Apple was working on an AppleTV announcement for September, delaying a debut said to have been originally planned for WWDC.
