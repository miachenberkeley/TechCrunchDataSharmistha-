Close your eyes. (Dont actually close your eyes because you have to read this, but just get in the mindset of having your eyes closed.)Now imagine yourself in a sort of glamorous shopping mall. The shopping mall is lined with various stores, all of which are filled with the latest technology from across the globe. Each store is attended not only by a helpful representative, but by the person who actually developed that very technology. Like buying software from Bill Gates. Now open your eyes. (I know, I know.)The heavenly vision I just described is very real, and exists for three days only during Disrupt New York in May. Since 2010, more than 450 companies have been through the Startup Alley in New York, and in 2013 we introduced country pavilions for international startups from across the globe. This year, we should have at least 50 companies within the country pavilions, not to mention the hundreds of companies who hail from the States. Oh, and I havent even gotten to the best part. Each day, as folks peruse the Startup Alley, one company will be selected to enter into the Disrupt Battlefield on the main stage as the Audience Choice winner. Those companies will get the opportunity to pitch live to crazy awesome judges, and if they do well, they may even make it into the Battlefield Finals, with a chance to win $50,000 and the Disrupt Cup. While weve seen Startup Alley companies make it into the finals, weve never seen one win. Maybe Disrupt NY in May will be different? The only way well find out is if you sign up for the SUA now. The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center. Tickets are available at an early-bird discount rate until April 11.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
