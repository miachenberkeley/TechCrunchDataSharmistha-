Were on our way to Atlanta and Boston in a few short days, and were ready to see the best that those tech communities have to offer. The world-famous TechCrunch Pitch-Off will hit Atlanta on February 24 and Boston on February 26, where select startups will have 60 seconds to pitch their product live on stage to a panel of judges, including TC writers and local VCs. But if you want to get in on that action, you need to apply now. Applications for the Atlanta and Boston TC Pitch-Offs close on Monday, February 16.We will announce the selected companies on Wednesday, February 18. Were also quickly selling out of tickets for both events, so if you want to kick back, listen to some interesting startup pitches, and get a free beer for the night, you should definitely consider picking up a ticket to the Atlanta Meetup on February 24 or the Boston Meetup on February 26. Tickets are $10 (21+ please). We cant wait to get to know you guys and see what youre working on, so if the Pitch-Off seems like a good fit for you, delay no longer.
