Attention New Yorkers!Applications for the NYC Meetup + Pitch-Off will be closing in 24 hours (ish) so if youd like to pitch your company to the coolest judges in the land (TBA next week), you really shouldnt waste another minute. Heres the plan, Stans:Participants will be afforded exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of kick-ass judges, to be followed by a quick Q&A. At the end of all of the pitches, judges will deliberate and choose the winners. First place will get a table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September, along with two tickets. Second place will receive two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner will receive one ticket to the big show. IF this sounds like something you want to be a part of, you have exactly 0 time to waste. So apply here now. But lets say you want to just hang out with cool peeps, watch the pitch-off and throw back a few cocktails. Tickets are available to folks 21+ for $25 right here. The event will be held at Le Poisson Rouge on August 18, with doors opening at 6pm ET sharp. Lets do this, folks!
