TechCrunch is headed back to Austin and Seattle in late June and were looking for a few good startups to pitch at the event. Is that you? Apply below.In past events in both of these cities people have shown up in droves, and with that sort of love we just cant stay away. The Austin meetup happens on June 23 and Seattle on June 25th. We cant wait.The goal is to bring the community together, get to know the fine entrepreneurs of Austin and Seattle, and get the word out about cool local startups.In order to do this, we hold a Pitch-Off, where pre-selected companies will have exactly 60 seconds to pitch their product on stage to a panel of judges, including TechCrunch editors and local venture capitalists. In the end, well crown a winner and carry on talking about tech and throwing back a few cold ones (this is a 21+ older event).First place will receive a table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. Second place will receive two general admission tickets to Disrupt, and third place will receive one general admission ticket.But this isnt just about the entrepreneurs on stage. This is about the college kid who has a bright idea and wants to see what its like to build a startup. This is for the designer, the engineer, the journalist. Everyone is invited, as long as theyre 21 or older.Apply to the pitch-offs and purchase general admission or sponsorship packages below.AustinSeattle
