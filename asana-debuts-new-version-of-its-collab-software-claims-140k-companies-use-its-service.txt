This morning at Asanas San Francisco headquarters, the startup announceda new version of its product, a new brand  logo  and, happily, some metrics about its growth.As you will recall, the startup picked up a new Head of Business from Google on Monday, announcing at the same time that it has expanded its revenue by 230 percent over the past year.Asana announced that it has annual recurring revenue in the low tens of millions, a metric that it predicates on the 140,000 companies currently using its platform. The firm also announced that it is expanding that number by 10,000 companies a month, giving it just under 100 percent year-over-year growth, on a customer basis.(You can grok the implied positive dollar churn of Asanas revenue growth compared to its customer growth.) (Protip: Looks good.) (Other protip: Ignore me.)In addition, Asana described a fast ramp-up to profitability. In the wake of the company hiring its new business head, TechCrunch indicated that Asanas performance is notable as a potential IPO candidate. Say, 18 to 24 months.Onstage, the company extended its revenue chart to include a note about going into the black, off of the red:That matters, because so many companies in the software as a service (SaaS) space grow quickly, but do so while main-liningamolotov cocktail of Other Peoples Money, leading to a years-long binge that can help some on their board presume that the bigger the loss, the greaterthe future positive cash flows. That can be, and sometimes is not; Asana is trying to play a different game.Asanas product has racked up usersbecause it can be useful for inundated teams that wantto escapeemail, while, at the same time, managing a less convoluted workflow. Thats the firms goal, at least.To that end, Asana announced today a redesign, and several new features that, presumably, it expects to bolster its current in-market performance. Asanas executive duo Justin Rosenstein andDustin Moskovitz said that new new Asana is redesigned from the ground up.According to the two founders, alongside their product team, the largest request that they received from users was to improve the design of theirapp.The new version of Asana launched to its users this morning, includingnew features designed to bring communication inside of its own platform (hello, Slack), and a tool built to assist users in keepingtabs on information inside of their current work environments.The last piece wont be available until early 2016, while the communications tool is now out.Asana therefore managed to complete the Current Business Trifecta, if you will, stressing quick growth, product advances, and a strategy to integrate its product into the workflowof others.That may sound like a reiteration of clich, but in this case we should allow the bland, given Asanascapital efficiency.Oh, and this is the new logo:
