Kevin Spacey dropped into the TechCrunch studio at Davos, event today and we asked him about his engagement with the tech world.Its his first year at the World Economic Forum and hes partly here because hes become an investor in cyber security firm Wisekey, which is working the halls talking to big corporate about their solutions.I asked him if cyber security was a genuine interest of his: Ive always been fascinated by the space and now that Im chairman of Relativity Studios, and in light of the Sony hack last year its prudent for anyone in my position and any business So Im here to meet and talk with these experts who understand how to create walls to protect you IP and content. Its just prudent.Hes been hugely successful with his serial House of Cards which was funded and produced by Netflix, and now the online video streamer has recently launched in many more global jurisdictions.He noted that its no longer the case that stars have to be in LA or Hollywood  for instance  to get noticed, as they can be discovered online. And that tech companies are going to get more into the content world.In the next few years Silicon Valley is going to much more involved in content. I would not be surprised if a big tech company would buy a studio Its what I thought a few years ago with Yahoo, or Google or Netflix. Those companies who have made a lot of money being a portal for entertainment if they wanted to complete they would have to start doing their on content so I wasnt surprised when Netflix stepped up, he said.
