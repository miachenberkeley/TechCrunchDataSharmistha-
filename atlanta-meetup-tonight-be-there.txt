The time has come. We are in the Deep South, enjoying all the wonders that Atlanta has to offer, and for the past 24 hours weve been saving the best for last. And if Im not being clear enough, you guys are the best part.What Im trying to say is we really want to see you at the Meetup tonight. This is our fourth year in Atlanta, and each year is better than the next. Well be holding the pitch-off as soon as the event begins, where 10awesome companies will pitch their startup in 60seconds or fewer, and then well get off the stage and spend some time getting to know each other.Well have local VCs at the event who will participate as judges and try to find their next big investment, as well as TC editors and writers. Oh, and there will be beer.I honestly cant see a single reason why you cant make it out tonight.The Atlanta Meetup and Pitch-Off is going down at 6 p.m., at Prive (960 Spring St. NW).Tickets cost $10 and can be found here.By the way, this is your last week to apply to the TC Disrupt Battlefield New York, so if that sounds interesting to you, check it out here. (Our Battlefield Editor, Sam OKeefe, will be on hand tonight to answer any questions about the competition.)
