After a few months of public beta testing, Atlassian todayofficially launched Stash Data Center, its Git-based, code-management service for enterprises. The service allowsbusinessestorun Git on a server cluster that can support a large number of developers. The largest beta deployment, the company tells me, supported about 12,000 developers.As Atlassians VP and general manager of its developer tools unit Eric Wittman reminded mewhen I met with him in the companys San Francisco offices last week, Git is turning 10 in April, but enterprises are only nowstarting to adoptit. He argues the reason for this is thatGit itself can be hard for companies to get their head around.Distributed version control is great, but Git is very raw, he said. Unless you can get into the headspace of understanding the underpinnings of Git, its not very approachable.Stash and Stash Data Center aimto make Git more approachable and manageable for large enterprises.Those businesses that try to adopt Git often hit the tools limits, especially as their teams grow. Access and permissions become issues, for example, and Git can be verytough on the hardware, which makes it hard just toscale the system as teams grow. Stash, unsurprisingly, includes support for fine-grained permissions, and Atlassian is especially proud of the clustering technology it uses, which runs with very little overhead and allows the service to scale pretty easily.Wittman tells me that about a third of the Stash team worked on this project for about a year. Some of the customers that adopted Stash Data Center during the beta period include Amadeus, Cisco,Splunk, Blackboard and Ciena.
