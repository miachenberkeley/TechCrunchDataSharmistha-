Hey all you investors out there,were excited to announce the companies that will be on display in the Startup Alley at Disrupt NY, and you can check out every single one of them on our brand-new Startup AlleyHub.In addition toall sorts of great information on Startup Alley companies, the Startup Alley Hublets you easily follow the companies youre interested in meeting up with, making it easier to connect with them during the show.Every startup has a profile that gives you high-level information about the company  details about their product or service, any investors theyve had to date and how much money theyve raised.The profile also has contact information for the companys founders and key employees and representatives so you have all the information you need to get in touch right at your fingertips.And, if youre so inclined, you can follow interesting company profiles on Twitter or through CrunchBase.Weve also made a few changes to the Disrupt App for Disrupt NY 2016. Each day at Disrupt, one Startup Alley company is selected as the Wild Card based on popular vote, and given the opportunity to participate in the Startup Battlefield. This year, were thrilled to announce that all Wild Card voting will take place in the Disrupt App itself, making it easier for Disrupt attendees to vote for their favorite startup right from the show floor.We wanted to make your lives easier at Disrupt by giving you a tool to help find the companies you want to connect with at Disrupt  and while we may be a bit biased, we think the new Startup Alley Hub and the in-app Wild Card voting are perfect tools for you as you plan your days at Disrupt.In addition to the hub, TechCrunch is also launching another tool aimed at making it easier for investors to connect with companies at Disrupt, CrunchMatch.With CrunchMatch, investors will be contacted to fill out a brief form about their investment portfolio and the types of companies they typically invest in. Then, TechCrunch will take that information and attempt to match you with companies we think youll be interested in chatting with. If you agree to the match, well facilitate a private meeting for you and the company on the Disrupt floor.You can read much more about CrunchMatch here.And, while were talking aboutthe show, Disrupt runs from May 9-11 at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Brooklyns Red Hook neighborhood, and we cant wait to see all you VCs, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts at the show.If you still havent gotten around to buying your tickets to Disrupt, you can still snag last-minute tickets to the show here.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
