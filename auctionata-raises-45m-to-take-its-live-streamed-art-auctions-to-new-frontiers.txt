The tide is rising forlive streaming services, and just as this isliftingapps, other kinds of streaming startups are seeing a boost as well. Today,Auctionata, a Berlin startup that broadcasts onlinelive auctions for fine art and collectibles, announced that it raised 42 million ($45 million) in a Series C round of funding from a group investors led by MCI Management andincluding Hearst Ventures.Auctionata plans to use themoney to expand its service to new geographies and new categories.Since the launch of the weekly live stream auctions in May 2013, Auctionata has grown considerably and has successfully positioned itself among the global leaders for online auctions of art, antiques and luxury collectibles, Auctionatas founder and CEO Alexander Zacke said in a statement. In the future Auctionata will focus on efficient growth and thereby lay the ground for both organic and non-organic category and geographic expansion.New auctionareaswill include musical instruments, memorabilia (think original Mickey Mouse ears and old baseball cards), architectural and garden pieces, diamonds, and real estate.It also plans to put investment into categories that it already offers like watches, classic cars, wine, jewelry, design, contemporaryart, fine art, antiques and Asian art; and also into the tech behind its live stream auction format.Live streamedauctions havebeen a long-held ambition among many in the art world. Such a format has the potential toopen the physical floor and all the bidding hype that comes with it to a much wider audience, and with that raising the bids for items on the block.Butearly attempts at live streamed events failed to meet their estimates (so to speak), complicated by slow broadband speeds, and much more. So while sites like eBay flourished in the category of real-time bidding for items, thelive action spectacle that went along with that remained firmly offline, with the only way for bidders not present in the auction room to get in on the action by callingin by phone.But the advances weve seen in streaming technology, network connectivity, peoples computing devices, and perhaps most of all what we as consumers have come to expect have changed all that.Even leading auction companies like Sothebys which was burned in the pastfrom a middling JV with Amazonback in 1999is trying again, just this month announcing that it would team up with eBay for live streamed auctions. Christies, too, offers a live format, although tellingly I couldnt get the link to work today when I tried to visit it.In that context, Auctionatas boat may be rising at just the right time, but with a lot of competition, too. The startup itself is growing, albeitfrom a small base. In 2014 it had net sales of 31.5 million ($34 million) in 2014, with 12.5 ($13.5) million in the first quarter of 2015.And like its much larger counterparts Sothebys and Christies, it is also not just an online business. It currently calls on300 experts across40 countries to vetobjects before they get listed, with full officesin Berlin and New York and smaller offices inLondon, Zrich, Rome and Madrid. All of this, too, will need investment to grow.The opportunity, however, is one that investors are willing to bid on.We are excited to back Auctionatas ambitious growth plans, said Sylwester Janik, a partner at Warsaw-based MCI Management, in a statement. The company is an excellent example of what we look for in our investments: a disruptive business model combined with a high quality team and a leadership with strong industry experience.Other investors in this round, addition to MCI and Hearst, includeKreos Capital from London and Yuan Capital from Hong Kong, as well as existinginvestors Earlybird, e.ventures, Kite Ventures, Raffay Group, TA Ventures, Bright Capital, REN Invest and Holtzbrinck Ventures.
