Silvercar, a startup rethinking the auto rental experience in airports, already seems pretty tied to Audi  after all, every vehicle that Silvercar rents out is a silver Audi. Now the companies are deepening that relationship with a $28 million Series C investment.Audi led the round, with the companys North American president Scott Keogh joining Silvercars board of directors. Silvercar and Audi are also looking beyond airports with a new initiative called the Audi Shared Fleet, where businesses will be able to offer cars to employees on their corporate campuses.Silvercar represents not just the future of the car rental industry, but a vision for the future of mobility, Keogh said in the funding release We want to utilize the companys strengths in technology and innovation to merge connectivity and mobility for todays consumer.Silvercar has raised a total of $60 million in funding. Previous investors Austin Ventures and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin also participated in the new round.Writer Ryan Lawler (now sadly departed from TechCrunch) tried the service outthree years ago in Dallas-Fort Worth, Silvercars very first airport. He came away impressed withthe ease of getting in and out of the airport rental dock, and he suggested that business travelers, in particular, might be willing to pay a premium to get a better experience. (The exact pricing varies from market to market.)The company says its business tripled in 2015, and its now launching in its twelfth market, Las Vegas, just in time for this weeks Consumer Electronics Show.
