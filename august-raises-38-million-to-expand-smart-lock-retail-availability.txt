Smart Lock purveyor August has raised another $38 million in funding, bringing the companys tally up to $50 million, the companys co-founder Jason Johnson told TechCrunch. Augusts Smart Lock attempts to reinvent the front door and rid the world of physical keys by relegating that duty to a smartphone. As Johnson noted, Hardware is expensive, however the new cash will not be used only to make hardware, but to sell it, too.The companys first product launched in the Apple Store in late 2014. We had a wonderful fourth quarter and a great first quarter of [2015], Johnson said. Yet the August Smart Lock is only available from the Apple Store, Amazon and the companys website. But thats about to change.In the near future Johnson says the Smart Lock will be available in more consumer electronic and home improvement stores, but Johnson wouldnt say which.Bessemer Venture Partners led the round, with participation from Comcast Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures. Bessemer Venture Partners Rob Stavis will join Augusts Board of Directors.Access control and security bring convenience and peace of mind to the digital home, said Rob Stavis in a released statement. Jason, Yves and the team at August have the right set of hardware, software, design and integration skills to realize this vision and extend in-home offerings in unexpected ways.
