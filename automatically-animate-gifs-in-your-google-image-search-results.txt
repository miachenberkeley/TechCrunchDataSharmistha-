Even though Im a huge Giphy fan, I still use Google Image Search a lot to find fun imageryespecially animated GIFs. The problem with using Google Search for this is that the results arent animated.Static as the day is long. Womp Womp.First world problems, but you have to click on each result to see the animation and its never guaranteed that what you click on is indeed animated. Sometimes its a static image representing an animated GIF. UGH.With this Chrome Extension, your world will change. Do a search and blammoanimation station:Enjoy your GIF-filled weekend, folks.
