Netflixs internal hackdays consistently produce awesome stuff. This year is no different.Want to watch Netflix on an NES? Or keep your significant other from blasting through OITNB without you? Or how about being able to jump right back to that hard-to-hear line of dialogue you missed?Theyve got hacks for that.Heres some of the coolest stuff from this latest hackday:Netflix runs great on most modern consoles, but what would it look like on the pinnacle of 1983 technology that is the original NES? Sure, youd have to compress movies down to about four colors  and even then, youd probably only fit about 10 seconds of video on a cartridge. But that wonky Mario-inspired platformer interface makes up for it, right?(More like House Of Cartridges amiright?)Wait, whatd he just say?I missed it too. Rewind it?Okay. Here we go *tap*Nope, you went too far. Were way past it now. Fast forward a bit.*tap*Agh, missed it again. Screw it. Probably doesnt matter.Aaaand you just missed the most important line in the whole movie.The SayWhaaat project lets you rewind line-by-line, all based on subtitles. I want this right now.You know that Two-man rule they use to prevent accidental nuclear launches? Imagine that, but for Netflix shows.Until both people enter their respective PINs, protected shows wont play.Alas, the vast majority of Netflixs hackday stuff never sees the light of day outside of the hackathon (that would require Netflix doing something new and public-facing that isnt just changing the UI for the zillionth time)  so dont expect any of this stuff to pop up on your account anytime soon.Want more awesome Netflix pet projects? Check out this Netflix/Fitbit double-hitter from last year  it tries to determine when youve fallen asleep in front of the TV, and rewinds/pauses your movie at that exact spot.
