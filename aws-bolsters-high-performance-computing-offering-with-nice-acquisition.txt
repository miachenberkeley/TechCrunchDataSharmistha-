AWS attempted to enhanceits high performance computing offering today when it purchased NICE, an Italian software and services company for an undisclosed price.NICE provides a set of tools and technologies that were attractive to AWS, andbrings with itan international clientele, which should help AWS expand its marketwith a set of customerswho have high-endcompute requirements.These products help customers to optimize and centralize their high performance computing (HPC) and visualization workloads while also providing tools that are a great fit for distributed workforces making use of mobile devices, AWSs Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post announcing the deal.Among the technology that NICE owns is a nifty tool they callDesktop Cloud Visualization (DCV), which provides remote access to 2D and 3D applications, giving engineers, game designers and others access to their designs and the high-end hardware to make them workin the cloud, no matter what desktop or laptop they are using..Another piece of technology called theNICE EnginFrame could also be particularly attractive to AWS.It enablescustomersto run high-end computing environments likeHPC clusters, data, licenses and batch & interactive applications inside astandard browser.Constellation Research founder, R Ray WangbelievesAWS gets quite a bit out of this deal.The NICEacquisition gives Amazona good trove of IP, access to good clients and a good presence inEurope, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). TheseIP capabilities help with performance and some newer features that can benefit the overall Amazon platform, Wang told TechCrunch.TheIP he referenced includes an algorithmic model for performance, he said.Its worth noting that AWS has had a substantial presencein Europe for some time with offices throughout the EU including Italy where NICE is located.The acquisitioncould give them access to a set of clients with much more intensive computing requirements. Just last year Amazon launched new C4 instances for companies with high performancecomputing requirements in the cloud. As TechCrunchs Frederic Lardinois wrote at the time:As Amazon notes, these new instances are designed for applications where CPU performance is critical. These include high-traffic front-end fleets, MMO gaming, media processing, transcoding, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications.For now, AWS intends to keep NICE in place with its own brand, products, customers and team continuing to operate just has it has been with plans to enhance the companysofferings and come up with new combined solutions in the future.
