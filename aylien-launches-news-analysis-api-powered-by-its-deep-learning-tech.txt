Text analysis startup Aylien, which uses deep learning and NLP algorithmsto parse textand extractintel fromdocuments for itscustomers, has launched a new tool specifically focused on analyzing written news content.The idea for the News API is to give access to the news content that is out there enriched and in real-time to developers and data scientists, says co-founderParsa Ghaffari. Its a very data and analytics centric approach to news.The Dublin-based startup says its utilizingcore text analysis techpowering its existing textAPIproduct, whichlaunched back in February 2014  but this time itsfocusing exclusively on news content and also doing a little more of the analytical heavy lifting for its customers.We decided to simplify the use case a little bit by collecting and analyzing the news documents on our end, rather than giving them the tools to do that themselves. So this was born out of that, says Ghaffari.He adds thatthetext analysis API was already beingused by news and media companiesto makes sense of news articles at scale  so the team has now stepped in with a tailoredproduct to better serve that demand.Ghaffari says theyretargeting the News API at developers, data scientists and solution builders in verticals such as publishing, PR, news aggregation, newsreader apps, hedge funds, media monitoring, and voice of the customer analysis solutions. So there will evidently be some overlap/cannibalization of existing Aylien users.ItsSaaS Text API product has nearly 20,000 subscribers at this point, withGhaffari flagging up the likes ofSony, The World Economic Forum and Complex Media as notable customers.While Ghaffari mentioned a plan to launch a news API all the way back in 2014, when TechCrunch last spoke to him, he says theidea then was to build a bare bones news ticker. Whereas the News API is a fully featured product in its own right  letting users performgranular search queries  such as, for example, askingfor news stories written about Donald Trump that havea negative sentiment and were published by news outlets based in Wisconsin.The product also serves up automated summaries of retrieved news article; points to related stories; profiles social media performance; charts the volume of stories on a particular topic over time; shows sentiment breakdown; and details article length.Users can search for news by byline to track particular journalists output  a useful feature for PRs wanting to intelligently target pitches. (Rather than, *hint-hint*, repeat copy-pasting I read your story about X and thought youd be interested in writing about Y )I ask Ghaffari whether he used the news API tool to determine which TC journalist to send his pitch to  and he confirms he did (as youd hope). So, in this one example at least, the techs targeting relevance was fair. (Itdid also suggest he approach my colleague Fred, who wrote the prior story on Aylien.)The tooldraws content froma (human) compiledlist of thousands of news sources  so, as with much AI tech, theres still a key role for the human brain when it comes to filtering/sanity checking source material, although Ghaffari reckons this too could be automated in time.At the moment its a manually curated list of sources that we monitor, he says, adding: We are looking at ways to automate source discovery But for the initial launch we wanted to have really high quality content, we didnt want to have any noise in there. There are challenges if you increase the number of sources, youre going to get a lot of duplicate content, a lot of low quality content We shouldnt do that unless we are confident we can provide measures for our users to filter that content.Ayliens analysis enginecurrently supports six languages  including English, Spanish, German and French which itshoping to ramp up to15 by July.Discussing how the core techworks,Ghaffari tells TechCrunch:We utilize Deep Learning and NLP to understand news articles better, by extracting things such as mentions of entities (people, brands, organizations, products, etc), authors sentiment, high level category and topical structure of each article, and so on, and we use this information in aggregate to train predictive models that can predict things such as best targets for a press release or most popular topics within a niche, which are tremendously valuable to a publisher, journalist or a PR person.Compared to classical Machine Learning, Deep Learning significantly reduces the need for manually labelled data, and makes it easier to hop from one language to another, or even from text to image and vice versa, without losing a lot of information, he adds.Our proprietary NLP engine learns how to perform multilingual language processing, which then it applies to news content, just by looking at large volumes of text, and that makes it much more scalable, and capable of learning new languages (which is crucial in our todays fragmented, globalized world) than what is available out there.In terms of competing products, hename checks the likes ofCisions media monitoring suite, plusproductsfromKantar Media and Moreover Technologies, but argues that Ayliens text analysis tech is much more advanced, given its been honing its algorithmic smarts for more than three years.There are similar offerings by Diffbot, by Alchemy API [and IBM Watson], but we have a lot more of a heavy focus on the fact that this is news content, not just any kind of document, he adds. Those guys look at news articles as just any other webpage. So thats one key differentiator.Pricing for AyliensNews API SaaS starts at $49 per month  for which the customer gets 30,000 articles. After that, if they want to analyze more data, theres a sliding scale price per article.The startup, which was founded back in November 2012, has raised $1.3 million to date, most recently taking in a 580,000 round from SOSVand Enterprise Irelandjust last month.
