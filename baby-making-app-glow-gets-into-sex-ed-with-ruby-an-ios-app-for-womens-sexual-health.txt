Glow, the appthat aims to help women get pregnant (or not) launched a new iOS app for womens sexual health today called Ruby.Rubyis similar to the other Glow family of products, but is tailored toward womens general sexual health as opposed to just reproduction  because, well, theres a lot more to us thanour baby ovens.Sex ed for young women is woefully missing in a mobile world. There are quite a few apps out there, but most arent compelling enough to download versus just Googling the information.Take iOS appSex Positive, for instance. This is an app aimed at sexeducation for college students.College students definitelyneed to be informed aboutwhat is okay and is not okay, sexually  one in four women report being raped or an attempted assault while in college  but students areprobably not going to download a random app to read up on what is appropriate behavior.Ruby is different in that it provides a community of support and enables women to track their sex life and other key health information like when they get their period by logging it on the app.Then, like an older, wiser sister, Ruby offersinformation, resources and sex-positive advice.To get a sense of what the female genderfaces psychologically, justwalk past the magazine section at any grocery store and readthe crazy messaging about how women should look and behave sexually. Some of it is comical, but could be taken as the Bible truth for those without enough knowledge or experience about what is okay and healthy.The idea behind Ruby isto provide women, especially the young and sometimes ill-informed with a better sense of self and to help them make informed decisions about their health, birth control and safe sex options.Ruby is partnerning with Bedsider,an online birth control advocacy run by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, to provide resources throughout the app.To offer young women a way to embrace their bodies and better understand their health really drives us, Glows marketing VP Jenifer Tye said.Rubywill also partnerwith Huru International, a nonprofit that provides menstrual hygiene supplies and sex education to young women in the developing world, for the launch. Women in developing countries such as Uganda often miss school when they get their period, simply because they dont havea way to stay clean. Ruby plans to help these young women to stay in school with a social media campaign. Each time someone tweets or posts with the hashtag #TalkRubyToMe, Glow will donate a day of supplies to one young woman.
