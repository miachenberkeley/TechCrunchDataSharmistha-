Baidu is pushing into the public WiFi space, after the Chinese internet giant  responsible for the countrys most popular search and maps services  led an $11.5 million investment inQianhai Mobile, a company that getsChinas commuters online.Qianhai Mobile, which is an affiliate of NASDAQ-listed media firm ChinaVision, provides wireless internet access on a range of commuter routes, including bus services across 18 cities in China. That deal covers around 35,000 buses in major cities that includeShanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.The company, which claims to reachover 7.5 million Chinese commuters via its VIFI service, revealed that private investorsGuangdong Zhongke Baiyun New Industry Venture and Dongguan ZhongkeZhongguang Venture also participated in the round. The fresh capital, it said, will be put to use expanding its infrastructure and securing more deals and deployments.Baidus involvement in the deal is strategic  and pretty interesting. The Chinese firm said it will work withQianhai Mobile to jointly develop and monetize mobile app distribution and other mobile passenger services powered by BaiduMap.Clearly, commuter WiFi services have vast potential. They offermorereliable (and potentially faster) internet access to millions while they commute to work and seek to filldead time. That lends such servicestobecoming hubs for others.Likewise, map services like Baidus are inherently at their most useful whena person is in transit. Thus, combining these two could create some interesting synergies and the potential to pipe in other relevant services  for example e-commerce deals, location-based promotions and other initiatives. The golden rule, of course, is to avoid abusing the position and ensure that each integration provides value to users.We are very impressed withVisionChina Medias many years of experience operating the leading public transit-based media platform inChina, and the Companys ongoing transition to an Internet-focused business. We are excited about theopportunity to work with VisionChina Media to truly address the needs of urban commuters and realize thesignificant long-term value of the Companys public transit Wi-Fi network, BaidusPeter Fang said in a canned comment.For those who ask, yes, the picture featured at the topis a stab at humor, not an actualQianhai Mobile rollout. Come on, its Friday  !
