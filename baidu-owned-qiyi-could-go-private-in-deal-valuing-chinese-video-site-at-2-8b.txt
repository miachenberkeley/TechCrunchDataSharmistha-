Chinas online video wars are heating up again.Last year, Alibaba snapped up Youku Tudou, the countryslargest YouTube-like video portal, in a major $3.5 billion deal, and now theres more happenings in the space after Baidu received an offer to sellits majorityshare in close rivalQiyi.Baidu, best known for its search technology and investment in Uber, owns 80.5 percent of Qiyi,and on Friday it disclosed that it received a bid for that stakethat values the video content service at around $2.8 billion. The offeris led by Baidu chairman Robin Li and QiyiCEO Yu Gong, and, if successful, it could lessen Baidus financial responsibility to the business and provide new funding options bytaking Qiyipublic.In a filing made at the end of its most recent financial year, Baidu disclosed that Qiyi  which is a subsidiary that is included in its financial results  was the primary reason for its content costs ballooning 125 percent to $301.7 million,andbandwidth expenditurerising 81 percent year-on-year.In a comment to Bloomberg, Summit Research Partners analystHenry Guo suggested that a China IPO, not a U.S. listing like Baidu, could be on the cards for Qiyi if it is allowed to go private viathis acquisition offer.If you IPO in China, because of the brand awareness, you may get a really high premium.In China, people dont care whether or not youre profitable yet, Guo said.Research last year suggested that theres little to separate Youku and iQiyi (Tudou remains a separate site to Youku) as the largest video platforms in China, but with Alibaba now in control of both Youku and Tudou, Qiyi and Baidu are making moves of their own.This bid for Qiyi follows another significant China-led deal this month.A consortium led by Baidu rival Qihoo 360 and Kunlun Tech, the majority owner of gay dating app Grindr, offered to buy browser maker Opera for $1.2 billion last week.
