Baidu, Chinas largest Internet search and maps provider, continues to see slowing businessas it adaptsto the rise of mobile. The companys latestQ1 2015 financial report continued an ongoing decline inrevenue growth and saw net profit dip year-on-year, too.Last year, the numberof mobile Internet users in China overtook that of PCs, indicating that a shift to mobile is wholly necessary for any tech company operating in the country. While mobileaccounted for half of Baidus revenue for the first time in Q1 2015, up from37precent across itsfiscal year 2014, key financial indicators showthe transition isnt quite sosmooth.Baidus total revenue for the quarter came in atRMB 12.725 billion ($2.053 billion). Thats 34 percent higher than one year previous, but the figure represents a decline in annual revenue growth compared to the recent quarter. In Q4 2014, Baidus annual revenue growth was 47.5 percent; that number was 52 percent in Q3 2014;58.5 percent in Q2 2014; and59.1 percent in Q1 2014.So, yes, Baidus revenue continues to grow, but its rate ofgrowth has tumbled sequentiallythispast year.Profit is down, too. Baidus Q1 2015 operating profit ofRMB 2.155 billion ($347.7 million) represents a 9.2 drop on Q1 2014. Net income fell3.4 percent over the past year to reachRMB 2.449 billion ($395.1 million)in Q1 2015.Baidu chairman and CEO Robin Li focused on the growth of mobile in a statement:Mobiles tremendous momentum continued this quarter, with mobile contributing 50% of total revenue.Baidu is redefining the search box by building an ecosystem to connect people with services and drive closed loop transactions. Baidus platform is comprehensive and robust, and we plan to fully exploit the huge growth potential ahead  in mobile marketing, online to offline, and key select verticals such as healthcare, education and financial services  by leveraging our solid mobile foundation, exceptional technology advantage, and proven operational experience.The company retains its position as Chinas top search engine  with around 80 percent market share  and it runs Chinas de facto maps service. It has experimented with an Android operating system (which was recentlyclosed), has introduced web apps, and it forked out $1.9 billion to buy top app store 91Wireless, among other strategies to diversify.Beyond these services, it isfocusing its efforts on big data and deep learning. Baidu hired former Google exec Andrew Ngas chief scientist forits U.S.-based lab, and  separately  it is developing language technologies that will enable it to introduce services in a range of emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America and North Africa.At this point, it isnt clear exactly how Baidu will use these technologies in its business  beyond the comments Li made above  but clearly mobile is the focus point for itsfuture strategies.
