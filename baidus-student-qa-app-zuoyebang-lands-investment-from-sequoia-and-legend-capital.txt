Baidu, Chinas largest search engine and an investor in Uber, is giving its Zuoyebangafter school service, which helps schoolstudentswith their studies, wings of its own after it revealed that the business raised an undisclosed Series A funding round.The new capital was provided by Sequoia China andLegend Capital, and is part of an ongoing Baidu initiative to open some services to external investment opportunities. The company has enabled investment inBaidu Takeout Delivery and 91 Desktop, two companies it span out this summer  with the former raising $70 million.This strategyaimsto promotethe independentquality assets,andto fosterBaidus open ecosystem, the company said.Zuoyebang, which began life as part ofQ&A site Baidu Zhidao, is aplatform where students can seek answers to study-related problems, and also provide solution to peers who are looking for assistance.Rumors of the services impending independence made the rounds in Chinese media this week, so word of this dealis not a huge surprise. Baidu said that the one-year-old service has over 50 million registered users, some three million of whom use it daily. Available for Android and iOS, the service has seen more than 950 million questionsand answers on file. Baidu said also that it is operational within113schools and educational centers across China.Its pretty clear from this move that Baidu wants some of its promising business to operatewith a more startup-like structure.Zuoyebang, for example, has less than 100 employees, nearly two-thirds of whom are focused on R&D, Baidu said.While it isnt going to the lengths ofGoogle, with its Alphabet reshuffle to help the U.S. firms more innovative projects operate with greater freedom, Baidus approach to spinning out someservicesisnonetheless notable. Combining links to the parent company with quality,external investors and their networks could, on paper at least, boostthese businesses. It also decouples them from the Baidu which, likeall other public firms in the country, is affectedbythe collapse ofthe Chinese market.The education market is a crowded one in China.Zuoyebangs competition includes offerings from close rivals Tencent and Alibaba.
