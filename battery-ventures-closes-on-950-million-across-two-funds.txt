Another 15 of its portfolio companies have been acquired.In fact, justyesterday, theLawrenceville, Ga.-based healthcare-software companyBrightree announced that itsbeing acquired by the medical-device company ResMed for $800 million in cash. Battery began investing in the company in 2008; it became the companys majority owner over the years.Battery is among a large number of firms that are expected to announce funds in 2016, with True Ventures, First Round Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz among them. Thats good news and bad news for the institutional investors that write checks toventure firms. As one limited partner told us yesterday, many investors love their venture customers, but they are being inundated with requests for capital at a very bad time, including because VCs havent turned as many of theirreturns on paperinto cash as their investors might have hoped.
