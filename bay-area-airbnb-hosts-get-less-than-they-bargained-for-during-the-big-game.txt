David Ordal is the chief executive of Everbooked, an Airbnb booking analysis company. As Super Bowl 50 draws near, some Airbnb hosts are hoping for a substantial payout. Crazy listings are popping up  this home is going for $6000 a night.If thats out of your price range, how about sharing a room for only $1300 per night?The thought process seems solid  an estimated million people descending on the already housing-strained San Francisco Bay area. With such high profile demand, the obvious conclusion hike prices sky-high, and hope for a big payday. But will hosts get it?Maybe I should AirBnB out my spare bedroom for $1000 per night for Superbowl weekend. Minimum 3 night stay.

Meghan Currier (@MeghanCurrier) January 26, 2016Probably not  lets take a look at the data. In Santa Clara, where Levis Stadium resides, the average Airbnb price for booked rooms is only up 25% compared to nearby weekends. How can this be?The answer lies in the good ol laws of supply and demand  unlike hotel rooms, the supply of sharing economy accommodations is elastic  the higher the price (or perceived price) goes, the more people put a place on the market. In the case of Santa Clara, there are 86% more Airbnbs listed for Super Bowl weekend than the surrounding weekends. There are so many properties available, that theres actually excess supply for Super Bowl weekend, which has put a cap on the additional revenue a host could make.Bay Area wide, the trend is the same. In only the past three months, Airbnb hosts with only one listing have grown from 9,627 to 13,732  an increase of 42%. This elasticity is hidden from a would-be Airbnb host  if exposed, it may make people think twice about asking for crazy rents.
