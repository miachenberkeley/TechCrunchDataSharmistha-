The days of CDs and vinyl might be (mostly) over, but singer-songerwriter Beatie Wolfe is making music physical again, in a very literal way.Wolfe stopped by the TechCrunch New York office to show off her jacket designed by Mr. Fish, who also created designs for legends like David Bowie and Mick Jagger. Not only does the jacket look pretty spectacular  it also uses NFC technology, so someone can tap it with their phone (uh, if shes wearing the jacket, maybe ask permission first) and bring up a page showcasing Wolfesnew single Take Me Home.I just wanted to bring back  or sort of revive  the best of that tangibility, that storytelling and that sense of ceremony that I experienced as a kid, she said. But make people that were streaming and downloading from iTunes and all of that, make them really want to engage with it.
