We seem to have been residingin asecond age of social media usage, a technological era of willful impermanence birthed from apost-Snowden culture that fears the concept of content which is immortal by default.Its in this environment that apps like Snapchat have thrived, but with what weve gained in perceived security we seem to have lost in online spontaneity and outward context.A new app for iOS, Beet, is hoping to bring back that context, and present and save our life memories and experiences for our friends in one package.Beet is essentially the amalgam of Snapchat stories stackable life moments and Instagrams comprehensive photo feed. On day-to-day usage itpretty much operates like Snapchat stories, sans photos, because youre generallyjust keeping up with your friends latest video updates. What makes it refreshingly unique, however, is how quickly you feel like you can get to know someone when you discover them for the first time.Beets co-founders Jonathan Miller and Sean Thielen hope that their app can help people focus on theless photogenic personality moments of their life.Social media tends to force us into sharing only those moments that we think will get the most likes, but that leads to a narrative that is disconnected from who we really are, Miller said. He added, These portrayals of our personalities dont really align with who we are, and it distracts your narrative.In lightof this pretty profound statement, I found it a little bit odd that Beet actually does have a like button for its videosunlike services like Snapchat, but otherwise the app definitely does live up to Beetsbroader mission ofsharing our lives in context.What reigns as the apps standoutfeature is the ease and comprehensiveness that Beet offers to those looking to follownew people outside of their friend circles. It takes a page from Instagrams discover feature, but instead of simply seeing a random photo from a users life, you are presented with what is essentially a movie of clips from thatusers life. Thanks to a major update this week, Beet is also introducing major improvements to the discovery section of the app and is allowing peopletodiscover other users based ontrending stories or user-moderatedevents.Much of the content that I saw from peopleon Beet, right now at least, didnt seem to be radicallydifferent from what Im used to seeing on other social media sites. Typical videos included people grabbing food with friends, lounging by the pool with hot dog legs, or out clubbing in the city. The app definitely has the potential to be different, but users habits from other social media sites sort of seem to be driving it right now.Miller and Thielen told me that the app has gained popularity with college users at fraternities and sororitiescreating group feeds that their friendscan post to collectively. They also mentioned a surge inparents documenting moments of their kids lives to share with relatives. On that note, users are indeed able to opt into security features that limit the visibility of their posts if they want to use the app with a small groups of people.Beet is new and is still picking up users, but its cool to see an app trying to simplify how we share our lives online at face value without any editing or filters. The apps similarities with Snapchats story feature are pretty significant, but its permanence really does change how you view users profiles (and online lives) as a whole.Beet is available now for iOS and will be updatedfor Android users later this fall.
