He was an engineer by trade, working with the firm Bechtel when he came up with an idea to streamline bid management for major construction jobs.Other solutions such as SmartBid and Procoreexistalready. Managerscould also cobbletogether a something to keep things organizedusing Excel and Google Docs, but DeVan believes that to bean inferior way to manage construction projects.The problem with all of the performance solutions, because I used to use them all, is they require you to maintain a static content database. The problem is people move from company to company all the time, DeVan told TechCrunch. So you go out to bid on a construction project and you realize your normal contact no longer works there.BuildingConnected aims to help managers build an up to date bid list and include data such as proposals and drawings, integrate those with services such as Box and Ignite and then create and build on projects from there in one place. It also allows contractors to communicate with one another on a project and make changes within the platform based on that conversation in much the same way as a team can make real-time changes in Google Docs.The platform will also provide business intelligence tools such as analytics tracking where projects are coming from  an important component for contractors to figure out where bid proposals might be getting lost.BuildingConnecteds list of features include:More than 250 of the countrys top general contractors now use BuildingConnected to bid on construction projects every month, according to BuildingConnected  including a new partnership agreement with Turner Construction Company,one of the biggestconstruction management companies in the U.S.DeVan mentioned over the phone that he expected his startup tohave more than 1,000 general contractors using the platform by 2016, which wouldmake BuildingConnected the largest provider of bid management services.The construction industry has a complex value chain that cries out for a network-centric technology, David SilvermannofCrossLink Capital, the lead investor in BuildingConnecteds Series A, said of the investment.
