Londons transport regulator TfL has concludeda review of a public consultation into changes to therules for private hire vehicles, dropping a raft of measuresthat would have substantially impacted ride-hailing app Uber.Among the measures TfL isabandoning are proposals to outlaw the ability to display areal-time location of a car for hire withinan app; an imposed minimum five-minute wait period between ordering and obtaining a ride; and a requirement that operators offer the ability to pre-book a ride up to seven days in advance.As youd expect, Uber lobbied fiercely against the proposals during thethree-month consultation period dubbing thembureaucratic and encouragingits users to sign a petition calling for TfL to drop the proposed changes. Ubers petitionwenton to gain more than 200,000 signatures.Today TfL said its publicconsultation attracted more than16,000 responses. Among the measures it is nowintending to takeforward are:The measures will be put to the TfL board for approval in March.Responding to the outcome of the reviewina statement, Ubers Jo Bertram, Regional General Manager in the UK, described it as a victory for common sense, adding: Were pleased Transport for London has listened to the views of passengers and drivers, dropping the bonkers ideas proposed last year like compulsory five minute wait times and banning showing cars in apps.For its part TfLargues the changes it has settled on will enhance safety standards in light of the impact of new technology. But it remainsconcerned about the rising numbers of private hire vehicles in London  noting that the number has increased from 59,000 in 2009/10 to more than 95,000 now, and adding: This has contributed to wider challenges for London such as growing traffic congestion, illegal parking and areas of poor air quality.So Bertrams other comment  that the TfL climb-down on more stringent measures means Uber can continue to keep London moving with a convenient, safe and affordable ride at the push of a button is not a littleironic. More vehicles on Londons streets will not yieldimproved traffic flow. Au contraire. But of course Uber isnt going to shout about thatTfL notes thatLondons mayor, Boris Johnson, has been having discussions with central government to push for legislation to enable TfL to restrict the overall numbers of private hire drivers and vehicles in order toreduce congestion. However it adds thatthe government has been reluctant to pursue such legislation. And without central government backing for a change inthe law to cap PHV numbers nothing is going to happenon that front. So Uber is likely to breathe easy for now.However TfL does say it isnow considering the impact and feasibility of removing theCongestion Chargeexemption for private hire vehiclesin central London  again as a measureto tackle pollution and reduce congestion.It notes that doing thatwould requirea variation to the Congestion Charging Scheme Order  which would be subject to statutory consultation requirements. So, in other words, there would be another consultation process required before Ubers (and other PHVs) mightbe required to pay to enter central London. So again, Uber isnt going to be overly concerned in the short term.That said,TfLs own estimate putsthe number of PHVs circulating within the central London Congestion Charge zone as increasingby more than50 per cent in the last two years. This means that 1 in 10 vehicles entering the zone is now a private hire vehicle, it notes. And such massive traffic increases are hardly sustained.So its possible central government might end up feeling public pressure to enable regulators to better manage the influx of tech-enabledPHVs in future. Not least when you consider increasing awareness of poor air quality in London. Something has to give in future. And the cleanest and least road-hoggingform of urban transportation is not an app-hailed car; its a human-powered bicycle.In related Uber news, a group of supporters of Londons black cab taxis this week kicked off acrowdfunding campaigntheyre hoping willfinance an application to secure a judicial review of the legality of Ubers PHV licencearguing that TfL failed to uphold the existing law when it granted Uber a licence to operate in 2012. At the time of writing the group has raised nearly 50,000 of the initial 600,000 theyre seeking to fund the legal action, with 54 days left for them to raise the rest of the cash.Commenting in a statement on todays TfL review ruling, Artemis Mercer, who leads the Action for Cabbiescampaigngroup behind the judicial review crowdfunding initiative, said: TfLs failure to regulate the swelling London private hire industry is proving to be an epidemic and they are now struggling to contain it.Whats worse isTfL issimply passing the buck to the Government when tackling soaring congestion. This should have been thought through before any licence had been granted in 2012.When Transport for London granted Uber a licence in 2012, it became a law maker instead of the law enforcer it should be  it has since failed to regulate the industry appropriately andadequately protect the lives of passengers, she added.The blurring of lines between the original two tier sector continues and effectively allows private hire operators to ply for hire via an app so they can just congregate where they know there will be lots of people and wait.
