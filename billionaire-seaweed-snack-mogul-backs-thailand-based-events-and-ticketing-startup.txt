In proof that investors can come in all shapes and sizes, a billionaire seaweed snack mogul in Thailand has invested in one of the countrys up-and-coming startups.Ittipat Tob Peeradechapan, who ownsTao Kae Noi  a company that sells friedseaweed snacks across Asia and raised $53 million in anIPOlast year  is one existing backer ofEvent Pop, an event management and ticketing startup in Bangkok which just raised a $500,000 seed round.Peeradechapan, who is 31-years-old and not known for being a tech investor, didnt participate in this new round, but this is the first time that Event Pop  which was founded in 2015 has disclosed his financial involvement,which we understand to beupwards of $500,000.Tob really took part in accelerating our growth,Event Pop CEO and co-founderPattaraporn Max Bodhisuwan told TechCrunch. With his input and mentorship, he has helped us to grow from zero to where we are today.If we didnt have him, it would have taken a lot longer.Peeradechapan, who was a billionaireat the age of 23and had his early life made into a film, has provided Event Pops funding thus far, but Singapore-based KK Fund led this seed round, which includes participation from OPT SEA  the VC arm attached to Japanese marketing firm OPT  and M&S PartnersHirokazu Mashita.A number of event and ticketing startups have come out of Asiasstartup world, such as Peatixin Japan, butBodhisuwan told us that Thailands event and ticket space is ripe for disruption while Event Pop is doing more than just ticketing or events. Itwants to bring bothtogether and help event management companies run ongoing campaigns and continually engage users rather than activities that are siloedaround events.In Thailand, Bodhisuwan said, a few big companies are dominant, and that has caused them to go stale and fall behind by not take advantage of new technology. To date, Event Pophas managed morethan 100,000 tickets sales for more than 300 events  thats two percent marketshare in just sixmonths of business, according toBodhisuwan, who is predicting the startups growth will increase ten fold this year.Weve been quietly building our business helping event promoters make the most of new technology and now, with our seed funding closed, we want to talk about how we can disrupt the industry and give event organizers the kind of tools and services that theyve been crying out for, he added in a statement.Event Pop is firmly focused on the Thai market for now, but, with investment from partners in Southeast Asia and Japan, it hasplans to expand regionally soon.
