BirdEye, asoftware company focused on helping its clients improve their business reputations and customer experiences in real time, has raised $8 million in Series A funding led by Trinity Ventures. As part of the investment, Trinitys Ajay Chopra has joined the board.Plenty of Silicon Valley luminaries also piled into the round,including SalesforceCEO Marc Benioff; Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang;Squares project engineering lead Gokul Rajaram;Kevin Weil (the formerTwitter product head who just hightailed itto Instagram);BranchOut founder Rick Marini; Haystack founderSemil Shah;and angel investorEllen Levy.To learn more about the company, which has been bootstrapped until now, we chatted earlier this week withCEO Naveen Gupta, who was formerly chief product officer at the telephony software company Ring Central, and whoseBirdEye cofounder is his brother, Neeraj, a longtime technical lead at Yahoo.Gupta says that what the company does in a nutshell is intelligent reputation marketing. To underscore how it works, he makes up an example,noting that these days, If your pizza is burned, yougo to Twitter and write [So and sos]pizza was burned. You go to Yelp and Urbanspoon and post negative reviews about your experience, or you tell your friends on Facebook.BirdEye collects signals from all that unstructured data and provides the pizza companywith a measurement of its business health based on thosefindings.Once the client companyfixes its act, step two is to amplify the good things people are saying about thatcompany. Was the pizza delicious? Wasyour car ready for you when you showed up to rent it?Consumers can let the company know by responding to a quick SMS message theyrelikely to receive shortly after the pizza was delivered, or while theyre still standing in the rental car parking lot. (Among BirdEyes relatedfeedback mechanisms are tweets, surveys, and other fields that make reviews simple to create.)It isnt a new idea; BirdEye has plenty of competition(though Gupta insists that because it isnt a pure-play reputation company, that it doesnt compete with 90 percent of the startups in its space).Still, BirdEyeis apparently getting some high marks. Guptasays it already works with more than 10,000 customers and that, before taking on funding, BirdEye, which has 40 employees, had turned profitable. (Itchargescustomers anywhere from $2,400 per year to several hundred thousand dollars annually, depending on their size.)The plan now is to build the next generation of the platform and expand it for bigger enterprises. Though it built its business by catering largely to small and medium-size businesses, Gupta says that increasingly, were being pulled up market.Now we want to fulfill the use case for Fortune 100 companies, too.Photo courtesy of BirdEye.
