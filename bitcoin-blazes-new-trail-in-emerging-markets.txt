Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.While the tech world is busyspeculating aboutbitcoins volatile value, cryptocurrency ismakingarguably itsbiggest impactin countrieswhere the current price of 1 bitcoin exceeds the average salary earned in a week.Kenya, Uruguayand Panamaare just a few of thecountriesplaying host to agrowinggroup ofventure-backedbitcoin companiesthat areusing blockchain technology to tackleregional payments challenges.Although the focus on emerging markets is a recent trend,cryptocurrencyhas beena global phenomenonfrom the beginning. While the majority(and largest)of rounds to date have been raised by U.S. companies,over 40 percent of the total venture investmentstrackedby CrunchBase in the past three years have gone into bitcoin startups based outside of the U.S.One of the reasons Im excited about bitcoin and blockchain is really the potential in emerging markets, where there are so many underbanked and the financial infrastructure is not as developed, says Jalak Jobanputra, founding partner ofFuture Perfect Ventures.As people becomemore connected with smartphones, theyre able to do transactions on these devices versus the brick-and-mortar infrastructure we have here in the U.S.  and blockchain just enables that to happen in a more efficient way, Jobanputrasays.Future Perfecthas backed three cryptocurrencycompanies, including Canadian blockchain infrastructure startupBlockstream and London-based bitcoin wallet providerBlockchain.Jobanputraslatest bitcoin bet, BitPesa, is an East African remittance platform based in Kenya.Yes, Kenyathe world leader in digital and mobile money. Over 75 percent of the adults in Kenya use a digital currency called M-Pesa, and over half of the GDP of the entire economy is operated over this digital currency, says Dan Morehead. Moreheads bitcoin-focused fund,Pantera Capital,led yesterdays$1.1 million round forBitPesa.BitPesa is among a number of startups tackling the $430 billion global remittancemarket by accepting bitcoin from overseas and converting it into local currencyfor delivery. This is a prime example of bitcoins ability toleapfrog traditional financial institutionsand improve efficiency.People talk about the 5 billion people in thedevelopingworld as being unbanked, and itslike callingthem un-landlinedthey skipped the whole landline thing and went straight to mobile phones, says Morehead. I think for most purposes theyre going to skip what we call traditional banking and go straight to mobile money.Morehead has already witnessed this first-handin Argentina, where his portfolio company BitPagos is using bitcoin to transfer U.S. dollars into the country for tourists.Argentinais avery classic use case for bitcoin: Argentina at the turn of the 19th century was one of the richest countries on earth, but since then, theyve had a series of massive devaluations that have been very hard on their paper currency. Bitcoin is a very efficient vehicle for transferring money in and out of the country, says Morehead.Whether for circumventingrestrictionsfor travelers or eliminating fees for locals collecting remittances, bitcoin technology has been able to provide a huge advantageinfacilitatingtransactionsacross borders.According toJobanputra, thisisjust the first stageof financial tech innovation inemerging markets.Some of the larger deals have happened more in the infrastructure and wallet space, but now youre starting to see new use cases in different markets, and new regional playerswillstartwith remittances before building a whole financial infrastructure for other types of services.
