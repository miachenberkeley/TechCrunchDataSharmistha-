Black Friday shoppers spent an average of 4.9 hours out at brick-and-mortar shops, according to data from Foursquare. Long lines meant that each shopper only visited 2.8 stores.The location-tracking service says it was also able to determine that Best Buy JCPenney, and Macys saw the biggest increase in foot traffic on the big day. Dicks Sporting Goods and Sports Authority rounded out the top five.Foursquare says its numbers show that Black Friday foot traffic was down 2% from last year, or over 5% if grocery stores and auto dealer visits are excluded. The shift to online shopping is taking the biggest toll on apparel businesses, department stores, electronics retailers, toy stores and mobile phone stores.Since many retailers play well in both digital and physical shopping, strong omnichannel brands may still end seeing overall sales gains, but others will not be able to make up the gap, said Foursquare COO Jeff Glueck in a statement.
