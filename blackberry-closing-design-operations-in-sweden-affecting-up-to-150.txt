Earlier this week smartphone maker BlackBerry confirmed it acquired Israels WatchDox to build out its security software business, but it looks like it may be downsizing elsewhere. According to reports fromSwedishnews sites,BlackBerry is closing down its software design operations in Sweden  abusinessthat grew out of its acquisition of UI startup The Astonishing Tribein 2010.News site Rapidusand financial newspaper Svenska Dagbladetboth note thatHans Bjrkqvist, a regional manager for the Swedish trade union Unionen, saysthat Blackberry is now in a consultation period with the union overclosing operations.A BlackBerry spokespersonhas now confirmed to the WSJ thatit is in consultations with the union. A consultation with a representative of a group of employees that may be laid off is one step in the closure process.At this time, we are considering the closure of our offices in Sweden [and] since this may impact approximately 100 employees, we are now initiating consultations with the employees trade unions, the spokesperson said. Our intention is to reallocate resources in ways that will best enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities across all facets of our business.One report from Swedish site8till5 noted layoffsof 100 in Malmo;Rapidusand SvDboth say it will be just over150 employees: 93 in Malm and 60 in Gothenburg.Numerous BlackBerry spokespeople that we have tried to contact to confirm the details have not responded to our requests for comment. When reached by phone, a switchboard operator in BlackBerrys Swedish office in Malm told TechCrunch that she was instructed not to comment on the report.Assuming the numbers are accurate, its not clear what operations will be affected, and where that work will shift. The WSJ reports that the Swedish team was working on BlackBerry 10 and other smartphone designs.BlackBerrys acquisition of The Astonishing Tribefor SEK800,000,000 (about $92 million) made a lot of waves when it happened nearly five years ago. The Swedish design firm was behind the user interface of the first Android phone, the G1, andat the time of the acquisition was (presciently) working on custom home screens for Android devices.As BlackBerry noted at the time, it bought TAT in part to work on the UI for its ultimately ill-fated PlayBook tablet, but also to lend design expertise to other touchscreen productsdeveloped by BlackBerry, specificallysmartphones andconnected carsystems.2010 was a very different state of affairs in the mobile world. While BlackBerrywasalready seeing some of the impactof Android and iOS popularity on its own handset sales, it wasnt out of the game altogether and still had a chance to turn things around.Figures from Gartnerfrom 2010show that BlackBerry (or Research In Motionas it was called then) was just two percentage points behind Apples iOS in smartphone market share, with around 15% of all sales, ranking number four in a market still dominated by Nokia. Still, it was already starting its slip: a year before, in 2009, RIM was number two just behind Nokias Symbian.Fast-forward to today and Gartner says that in the last quarter BlackBerry had just 0.6% of all smartphone sales.Under its current CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has been trying to make a gradual shift as a business over the last several quarters, to focus more on software and return to its enterprise roots  which is where the WatchDox acquisition fits in.As we pointed out earlier in the week when we reported on the WatchDox acquisition, BlackBerry actuallyposted a profit last quarter of $28 million, but on declining revenues of$660 million, down from $976 million a year before. In other words,profit was largely down to drastic cost cutting, not business growth.Indeed, as Rapidus notes, the company laid off more than 1,800 employees in the last financial year.Updated with comment from BlackBerry.
