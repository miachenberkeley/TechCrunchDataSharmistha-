BlackBerry has confirmed that it is exiting Pakistan entirelyin response to the national governments continued demand to monitor user data on the Canadian companys service.Back in July, thePakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) said it would shutterBlackBerry Enterprise Services(known as BES)by December 1 for security reasons. The issue was thought to center around BlackBerrysencryption of emails, BBM messages and other data from its users which prevented authorities from gaining the access to information that they deemed necessary for national security.BlackBerry kept silent at the time, but now the phone maker, which recently launched its first Android handset, has confirmed it will leave the country  with a population of 180 million people  after November 30 afterit refused to grantPakistani authorities access to its systems.BlackBerryCOOMarty Beard explained more in a blog post:The truth is that the Pakistani government wanted the ability to monitor all BlackBerry Enterprise Service traffic in the country, including every BES e-mail and BES BBM message. But BlackBerry will not comply with that sort of directive. As we have said many times, we do not support back doors granting open access to our customers information and have never done this anywhere in the world.Pakistans demand was not a question of public safety; we are more than happy to assist law enforcement agencies in investigations of criminal activity. Rather, Pakistan was essentially demanding unfettered access to all of our BES customers information. The privacy of our customers is paramount to BlackBerry, and we will not compromise that principle.Interestingly, while the PTA was focused only on gaining access to BES, BlackBerry said it has decided to withdraw its consumer business (BIS: BlackBerrys Internet Services) from the countrytoo.Pakistans demand for open access to monitor a significant swath of our customers communications within its borders left us no choice but to exit the country entirely, Beard added.While it isnt clear exactly how many customers  business and consumer  BlackBerry has in Pakistan, the phone-maker has seen its consumer market share dwindle to an all-time low, even in emerging markets where it once ruled, as affordable Android devices with more apps and options have risen. For that reason, its presence within the enterprise spaceis particularly important  although even that pie is being eaten at by Apple and Android phone makers taking advantage of bring your own device policies that enable employees to have consumer devices as work phones.Pakistan isnt likely to be a major revenue source for the company, and, on the positive side, this moveshows itis making a stand for user data and security, two areas where it has long believed that it can stand apart from the competition  particularly in the enterprise space.You be sure that BlackBerry will be keen to make that point to its existing and prospective customers.Long term watchers of BlackBerry (which was formerly known as RIM), will be aware that the company wasnt always so principled on security. After a long back and forth in India, it gave authorities access to data from BBM and BIS in 2013, while it was thought to have made concessions to do business in Russia and China in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Those were pre-Snowden-NSA times, and heightened awareness of monitoring could be a swaying factor, too.
