If Apple really is working on a car, it wont be the Ultimate Driving Machine. BMW and Daimler have discontinued talks with Apple over a potential automotive collaboration, Handelsblatt reports.Things fell apart (last year for BMW, more recently with Daimler) over questions of leadership and ownership, the German newspapers source said  and given what we know about Apple, that seems like a perfectly likely sticking point. The idea of integrating the car closely with Apple services rather than their own may have rattled the car makers; of course, automotive brands are among the most powerfully guarded and promoted in the world.So whos left for Apple to work with? The latest rumors point to Magna, a Canadian-Austrian specialty electric vehicle maker that works with multiple badges to produce limited editions and one-offs. With top-shelf cred, less brand jealousy and probably less-demanding terms, Magna sounds like a good match for a well-heeled dilettante like Apple.
