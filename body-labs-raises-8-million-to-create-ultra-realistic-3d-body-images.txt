Body Labs, makers of technology that provides true-to-life 3D body models, is announcing the close of an $8 million round of Series A funding led by Intel Capital, with participation from FirstMark Capital, Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH, Osage University Partners, and Catalus Capital.Body Labs technology is able to garner a fully realistic 3D body scan, complete with wrinkles and back fat, that goes well beyond matching up points on a body and actually includes data about the different properties of the human body. And beyond that, Body Labs technology allows you to add motion to the 3D body model to see how certain fabrics or materials might move or wear in the real world.The implications of this are huge. The system allows you to do things like health tracking, special effects in Hollywood, and even more immersive video gaming (featuring you as the main character, complete with back fat). But for now, the company is starting with customized apparel.The company is currently working with the United States Army to design Kevlar vests that fit womens chests, which are less predictable than mens. Body Labs is also getting scans for shoe manufacturers to build better orthotics, as well as various sports apparel companies to help build protective gear that fits the relatively odd body of a professional football player, for example.That said, Body Labs ultimate vision is to be a repository of information about the human body, with a set of APIs called BodyKit that would let developers integrate this technology into a host of various applications. The company has also developed a web site called BodyHub.com, which allows average users to upload their body scan and share it with companies who need it for a fitting, etc.Thus far, the company has worked as a consultant for various brands and organizations, but this latest round of funding provides the basis for Body Labs to build their own comprehensive suite of tools and products to let brands and consumers alike use realistic 3D body scans for their own uses.
