 The Bold Knot is a neatly designed top-upbattery pack aiming to preventsmartphone users from running out ofbattery towards the end of the day. Plug it in and your beloved handsetwill get a fuel injection(equivalent to three hours extra talk time).The idea is to offera more portable and more stylish  alternative tocarryinga full-size power pack.The top-up charger can also double as a USB cable, allowing for sequentialcharging of the Knots 700mAh cell immediatelyafterits charged yourphone all from the same USB port. Theteam alsoclaims their device charges your phone 2x faster than other USB cables.While its a neat looking prototype at this point, whats most interesting about the Bold Knot aside from its cute, keyring-esque design  is the team behind ithails from the West Bank.The founders, business development consultantLama Mansour and engineer Ismat Tuffaha, are both 22 years old and both Palestinian. They met at university and started work on one startup but found it too difficult to grow the business there because of border restrictionswhere they lived. Bold Knot is their second attempt at a startup.Theyre currently raising crowdfunds on Indiegogo to getthe device to market  but even getting to this pre-launchstageof business development required they leave the West Bank, so theyre now building the business out ofEurope.Access to funding is of course the lifeblood of startups. And economic conditions for Palestinians entrepreneurs remain hugely challenging, to say the least. A World Bank report published this week warned that the economy of the Gaza Strip, the other Palestinian territory, is on the verge of collapse, with unemployment set to reach a staggering 44 per cent, following last years 50-day conflict with Israel.As all doors were closed in Palestine, we sought an international fund, got accepted at Buildit Hardware Accelerator in Estonia, received a 10K fund in return for 6% equity. We couldnt have launched or taken the project anywhere before leaving Palestine, the teamtells TechCrunch.At the time of writing the Knothaspulled in more than $45,000 in crowd pledges  well beyond their original goal of $15,000. Its being offered to backers starting at $39, with an estimated shipping date of this October.
