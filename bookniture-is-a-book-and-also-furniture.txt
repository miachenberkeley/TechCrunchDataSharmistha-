You love books but you also love places to sit. Youre in a bind. The evil Dictator of your tiny country says you can only one of the two  a book or a chair. What to do? If you have Bookniture, you can thumb your nose right at Generalissimo Alibrias state photograph and sit on your book.What is this thing? Well, its basically a fold-away form of furniture made of carefully constructed cardboard. When closed you can put the furniture up on a shelf and when open it can support up to 375 lbs. What can you do with your Bookniture? Take it on a picnic! Sit on it at home! Use it as a little table! Make someone sit on it as a joke! The possibilities are endless!Why is this cool? Well, its a novel way of thinking about design and home furnishing and its a decidedly high-tech way to sell something surprisingly cool. I could see this as a special addition to a startup den or co-working space and its a clever use of engineered paper to create a usable piece of furniture.So fight Generalissimo Alibrias with your secret Bookniture. He doesnt have power over you and your carefully seated fellow freedom fighters anymore. Viva la hassock!
