Booktrack, a startup out of New Zealand that creates soundtracks to accompany e-books, has raised another $5 million in funding to make sure that reading is no longer a quiet activity.Led by COENT Venture Partners and Sparkbox Ventures, the Series B round brings Booktracks funding total to $10 million. Previous investors include Peter Thiels Valar Ventures and filmmaker Peter Jacksons Park Road Post Productions.Booktrack launched its first two tracks on the app store four years ago, and today the company offers a library of15,000 titles toits 2.5 million users.Each booktrack  think movie soundtrack for your book  consists of music, ambient audio and sound effects that automatically sync with your reading pace as you tap through the pages of an e-book.Book publishers can either create their own soundtracks, or pay Booktrack around $1,000 per novel to create the trackfor them. According to founder Paul Cameron, around 50 publishing companies includingHarper Collins and Random House are using the platform to generate a new revenue stream from both old and new titles.There are so many ebooks gathering digital dust on digital shelves, and we can bring them to a new audience of readers, says Cameron. Were able to get the Xbox, Netflix and Spotify generation interested in reading again by pairing it with another main form of entertainment.The real value of Booktrack, which seems a bit intrusive and unnecessary to readers who prefer to use their imagination, may be in the classroom. Cameron says that students reading with bookracks read for 30 percent longer, on average, and score 17 percent higher on reading comprehension tests.Currently, over 12,000 schools worldwide subscribe to Booktrack Classroom, which lets students access existing booktracks, as well as create their own.Reading is the only mainstream entertainment medium without synchronous sound, Cameron says. You dont go home and watch TV with the sound all the way down.Whether Booktrack is building thefuture of reading or merely pandering toatech-obsessedmillennial generation is yet to be determined. The companywill use the new funding to expand its library of titles and continue rolling outnew features for soundtrack personalization.
