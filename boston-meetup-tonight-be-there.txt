Dear Boston,TechCrunch has arrived. And even through all the snow, I can honestly say that you folks are looking wicked smaht this year.The Meetup + Pitch-off is going down tonight at Estate at 6 p.m., and we literally cannot wait to see you.Ten wonderfully brilliant startups will be taking the stage tonight to tell you about their products in 60seconds or fewer, with a panel of judges weighing and measuring each to decide who deserves a trip to TechCrunch Disrupt NY in May.After the pitch-off, well all get together and have a few beers and chat about what were working on.Its always fun, and I expect tonight to be better than all previous years combined. But you are a big part of that. You have to show up with a smile on your face and your Twitter feed tuned to #TCMeetup.Sound good?If you havent already done so, you can get tickets here.Oh, and before I forget TechCrunch Disrupt NY is going down in May and applications are open for the Disrupt Battlefield, so dont tarry! Apply now!
