Boxful, a Hong Kong-based startup that enablescustomers to store unwanted items in warehouses, has landed $6.6 million to developits domestic business and expandinto other parts of Asia.The service is designed to give those living in crowded Hong Kong, where real estate prices are higher than many other parts of Asia, a way to stash their goods while maximizing their living space or office.Launched in January 2015, the Boxful serviceusesmobile apps to simplify the process much like US companies MakeSpaceand Clutter.Boxfulcharges upwards ofHK$29 ($3.70) per month per box, which includes free pick-up and door-to-door delivery. The company said only that it has thousands of users, the majority of which are household customers  although co-founder and CEO Norman Cheung believes the service will increasingly appeal to business users, particularly SMEs.Boxful operates in a fairly crowded space  no pun intended. In addition to traditional storage companies which have been operation in Hong Kong for nearly 20 years, half a dozen or so startups have sprung up offering on-demand services. Unlike its competitors, Boxful handles logistics  collection and delivery  itself, while it uses storage facilities slightly out of town to maximize cost savings. Finally, its boxes are standard issue, which means they can be stacked to use the warehouse space more efficiently.All these things help us to reduce rent and increase efficiency of the units, Cheung told TechCrunch in an interview. We really squeeze out all the efficiency within the warehouses.Boxful, which raised a $1.5 million seed round earlier this year, will use this Series A capital toinvest in growing its logistics and team, as well as increasing its tech capabilities. Cheung said the company is focused on Hong Kong right now, but itis planing to expand overseas next year.Ultimately, the funding is also earmarked for other major cities that we want to expand into, but we dont have any concrete plans, he said. Thelaunches will initially be small scale, well test out eachmarket and if things go well we can be comfortable scaling.Boxfuls new $6.6 million round was put together by a range of investors, including real estate firmsGreat Eagle, Carlton Holdingsand Soundwill Holdings.Chinese conglomerateTinghsin Group, and VCfirmsArocrest Capital, SingaporesLonsdale Capital andVega Properties rounded out its backers.
