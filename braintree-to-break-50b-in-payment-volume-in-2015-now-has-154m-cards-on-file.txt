As Apple Pay continues its expansion to more retailers and payment providers (most recently, it appears, in-store at Best Buy), and Stripe continues its expansion march, another one of the big competitors in the payments spaceis today publishing numbers that underscores how its growing, too. PayPal divisionBraintree, which thepayments company acquired in September 2013 for $800 million, says that it is on track to ring up $50 billion in authorizedpayments volume by the end of 2015.Braintreealso says that it now has 154 million cards on file across 46 markets  triple the number on file when it first made the leap to PayPal. As another point of comparison, Braintree had processed $12 billion in transactions in September 2013. And while Braintree now handles payment processing for many PayPal services, too, the company says that the $50 billion is a like-for-like comparison in terms of what it is measuring.Juan Benitez, GM of Braintree, says the numbers that Braintreeis unveiling are a signal of how the companyis hoping to become more transparent to users about its size and what it does as a business, a return to how the company used to do things. Before the PayPalacquisition, Bill [Ready, the CEO] made a priority to tell the market about ourprogress, and we want to come back to that and share where we are at, he said.Some of the big milestones of growth for the company include its partnership with Bigcommerce, which added 90,000 merchants to Braintrees payment processing platform, as well as its recent acquisition of Modest. Like Stripes expansion to enable the building of native buying experiences in apps, the idea behind Modest will be that it will give PayPal and Braintree a better way of integrating further into third-party sites.We believe the Modest acquisition will be as transformative as Braintrees first acquisition, Venmo, says Ready.
