BookDoc, a new entrant to the space of online doctor bookings in Southeast Asia, has raised a seed round of financing which includes a $2 million investment fromPrince Abdul Qawi, a member ofThe House of Bolkiah, the ruling family of Brunei.Royal families investing in technology startups is nothing new. Saudi Prince is a shareholder of both Twitter, Lyftand Snapchat, not to mention Apple, Fox and TechCrunch parent AOL, but this is the first investment from Bruneis royalty in a tech startup. The 41-year-old prince, who is seventh in line to the Brunei throne, isan active businessman and is chairman ofBrunei Hotel among other ventures.Thatbig name aside, the roundalso includes participation from other investors, although neither their identity nor the total size of the roundwas disclosed beyond the amount that the prince contributed.BookDoc launchedin Malaysia in October2015 and it recentlyexpanded to Singapore and Hong Kong. The service is not unlike billion-dollar U.S. startupZocDoc, and regional competitors such asIndias Practo, which justmoved into Southeast Asia, and DocDoc in Singapore.Chevy Beh, one co-founder of BookDoc, told TechCrunch that he first became acquainted with the princethrough playing polo.Beh, who was formerly managing director ofBP Healthcare Group, said the funding round and valuation are the largest of any seed-stage startup company in Asia. But since neither he nor the company are providing raw figures on account of competitors, the validity of that claim remains unclear.The BookDoc co-founder did say that the company wants to go beyond merely patient bookings and expand into insurance and offer a marketplace for health services from third parties. Insurance has synergies with the startups existing focus on healthcare for corporate companies. Beh said also that the startup plans a rapid expansion across Southeast Asia. It is aiming to be present in a total of six countries by the end of this year, withIndonesia, Thailand and the Philippines its targets over the coming months.We werenot looking to raise [this round] but [found a] good investor and it is testimony to the company to have him involved, Beh told TechCrunch.With total fundraising amounting to a few million U.S. dollars, Beh said that BookDoc is not actively looking but if theres a good strategic partner then it might be interested.
