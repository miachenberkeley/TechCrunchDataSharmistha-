For the tenth and final episode of Built in Brooklyn, we tried to do something a little different  instead of visiting another startup, we talked to the team at HappyFunCorp, a design and engineering firm thats helped a bunch of local startups get off the ground.HappyFunCorps clients include New York City companies like Boxee, CoPromote, Paperless Post, and SimpleReach. (It also works with bigger customers like American Express, Victorias Secret, and AOL, which owns TechCrunch. Oh, and the firm employs TechCrunch columnist Jon Evans.)With that experience, I figured co-founders Will Schenk and Ben Schippers could offer a broader perspective on how the Brooklyn startup scene has changed  not surprisingly, they both had mostly positive things to say. And even though Schippers acknowledged that parts of Brooklyn are getting more pretty damn expensive, he argued that theres still room for young, broke startups.There are still huge pockets of Brooklyn that are inexpensive, so I think youre seeing people really, truly bootstrap startups, he added. I dont know that theres any specific vertical thats hot in Brooklyn, but what youre seeing is the opportunity to live in Brooklyn at a fair wage, if youre willing to go a little further out. And because of that, youre going to get a lot of innovation, youre going to get a lot of young people, theyre going to take risks.Schenck and Schippers also recounted starting the company in an attic, talked about their HappyFunAcademy training program, and showed off a new product called Benevolent Gaze for monitoring your office network.Since this is the last episode of Built in Brooklyn (at least for now), I want to close with a big thank you to TechCrunch TV producer Steve Long , whos shot and edited every segment. And thanks to everyone for watching.
