Bumble, the popular dating app where girls make the first move, has released an updatethat may turn the dating app world on its head.The new feature, called BFF,essentially lets users use the same swiping and matching algorithms for friendship instead of dating.Heres how it works:After switching into BFF mode, users will see their potential dates replaced by people of the same sex that Bumble thinks you would want to be friends with.Once both people swipe right, both partieshave24 hours to initiatea conversation, similar to how Bumble handles same-sex dating today.To differentiate between BFF and regular Bumble, conversations in the app will be color coded.Your conversation will be in greenwhen talking to new best friends, and yellow when swipingfor a hot date.And, while the initial roll out will force users to maintain one profileto be used for both dating and BFF mode, the company is working on releasing a dual-profile featurewhich would let users tailor the pictures and descriptions in theirprofiles depending on if they are looking for friendship or romance.Butwhy does Bumble think that its users want to use the platform to find best friends? Because users have not only been requesting the feature, but have already been using the platform for that purpose, the company explained.Specifically, they have seen usersusing Bumble as a means to connect with new friends when moving to or just visiting a new city.While Bumblewouldnt disclose the specific algorithmic differencesbetween a regular match and a BFF match, the companydid say that they are paying very close attention tointerests and friends, which theyobtain from a users Facebook profile.Implementing BFF makes Bumble the first major dating app to expand outside, well, dating.Its a brave move by a company thatdoesnt really need to try anything new, at least for now.The startup has added 1.5 million users since January alone, and 100 million messages have been exchanged in the last three months.The new update is live now, and can be downloaded from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
