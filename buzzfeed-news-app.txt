Are you the kind of person who says, I read BuzzFeed for the news? Do you secretly wish you didnt have to wade through all those listsicles and quizzes to get to the serious reporting? Well, BuzzFeeds releasing an app just for you.The company is launching an iOS app called BuzzFeed News, and at first glance, its pretty much what youd expect. Unlike the main app, which offers the full range of BuzzFeed content, or even sillier apps like Cute or Not, BuzzFeed News presents a feed of more serious, news-y stories.But there are touches that make this more than a simple repackaging of BuzzFeeds journalistic side. For one thing, the feed isnt just the usual combination of headlines and photos  there are also embedded tweets, pull quotes, related stories, bullet point summaries and timelines that give broader context to the news.Not all the stories come from BuzzFeed itself  when I opened the app this morning, there was at least one link to The New York Times.And if you want to keep up on news even after youve put your phone away, you can set up push alerts. The menu includes obvious choices like World and US News, but also a more specific option, namely the FIFA corruption scandal, and Ican imagine more categories in that vein.News Apps Editor Stacy-Marie Ishmael joined BuzzFeed last fall, and shetold me she was lured over from the Financial Times (where she was vice president of communities) partly by BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Perettiscommitment to a distributed strategy.Now, when BuzzFeed and other companies talk about distributed, thats usually equated with pushing stories to social media. But in Ishmaels view, thats only part of it.Distributed is often talked about as sending your audience away from you, she said. The way Ive thought about it is, youre going to where your audiences are.  If stuff is already built, lets hang out. If it isnt built yet, well build it and throw a really good party.So from that perspective, launchinga native iOS app is as much a part of that strategy as creatingFacebook-specific videos.Ishmael added that while some news organizations (including the FT) are moving away from standalone apps, the native approach still offers capabilities that you cant get anywhere else  like those personalized notifications, which Ishmael said her team can approach in a more granular way, creating new alert categories as required.Of course, there have to be enough stories to justify those categories: Theres no point in creating expectations youre not going to fulfill. Thats one reason why its important for Ishmaels team to work closely with the BuzzFeed writers and editors actually reporting onthe news.Ishmael also noted that everyone on the appseditorial staff haspublished stories on BuzzFeed  but their focus now is on curating the newsin the app and on creating the timelines, summaries and other extra content.There will be a BuzzFeed News app for Android later this year, shesaid, andit wont just be a straight conversion of the iOS version, but will also include platform-specific features.
