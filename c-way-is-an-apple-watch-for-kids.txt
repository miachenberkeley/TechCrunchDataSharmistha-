While wandering the Eureka Park floor at CES, we ran into C-Way,a cool French startup that is making GPS-enabled smart watches for kids.So what exactly does a smart watch for kids do?Well first off, it helpsparents keep track of their kids location. By embedding a GPS sensor in the device, parents can open C-Ways app and see where your child is at all times, thanks to a built-in, 5 per month EDGE data connection.C-Way also acts as a scheduler for your child. Parents can input their kids schedule into the app, and the device will send alerts to the child, as well as let parents know if the childs current location matches up to where their schedule says they should be.The watchalso lets parents send one-way text messages to the kids watch, using the built-in data connection.The device has a 48-hour rechargeable battery, and has different attachments that can be used depending on how old your child is.Older kids can use a version with a small LCD screen, which younger children may prefer the version that swapsa screen for a wearable lego platform where they can attach their favorite Lego figurine.The company is also producing a smart alarm clock called Bubble, which is designed to sit in a childs room and includes similar features like scheduling, 1-way voice chat, and even the ability to monitor air quality.C-Way and Bubble are available for preorder now, and cost $149 and $139, respectively.
