Truecaller, the European company behind the popular caller ID app of the same name, has laid off 30 staff across itsStockholm, India and San Francisco offices as part of an apparent staffing strategy shift.We have let a number of consultants and few full-time employees go recently which is natural to any company in a high growth stage, the company confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. We heard rumors of this change this week, which was also spotted and reported on by Sweden-based blogs Breakit and Swedishstartupspace.Back in July, we reported that Truecaller was raising $100 million at a $1 billion valuation. That round does not appear to haveclosed yet, but it couldtake the companyinto the much-hyped unicorn category of tech companies valued at $1 billion or more. To date, True Software, maker of Truecaller, has raised around $80 million including a $60 million Series C. Itsinvestors includeAtomico,Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers,Sequoia Capital,Access PartnersandOpen Ocean.Why are the jobs being cut?A source inside Truecaller told us that they are principally related to a change instaffing. Truecaller had employed a large number ofcontract-based staff, but it is now moving towards a structure of full-time teams. However, as its statement reads, some full-time staff were affected by the layoffs  which we also understand is mainly affecting the companys centraloffice in Stockholm, Sweden.With its nextraise still to close, this could be a little belt tightening and tidying of the house to lock down investor interest and getthisimportant Series D round over the line.The companys signature calling app provides contextual information about people who ring you  such as their photo, information and whether they have been marked as spam by other Truecaller users. The apphas over 200 million registered users, and it is particularly popular in India. This summer,Truecaller branched out to offer a social SMS app.
