Nearly eight months after launching a platform to connect college students with local job opportunities, Campus Job has raised a $7.8 million Series A round of funding led by General Catalyst Partners, with participation from Index Ventures, Box Group, SV Angel, Slow Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and others.The company originally launched with a model that allowed students to sign up on the platform and look for part-time work nearby, while companies who were looking to hire had to pay to unlock each listing they posted once qualified applications had come through. In January, the startup pivoted to a new model that asked companies to pay extra for more advanced search criteria, upping the cost of unlocking applicants profiles.Campus Job has also recently added full-time job search for seniors, with partners that include Snapchat, Zenefits and Yelp. The company says that its seeing 10,000 new students each week and processing more than 12,000 job applications each month. In total, there are more than 125,000 students on the platform from more than 2,200 universities, with employers like Dropbox, Starbucks, Postmates, T-Mobile and Oscar seeking applicants on the platform.Campus Job recently graduated from Y Combinator.Co-founder Liz Wessel said that the biggest challenge right now is maintaining the balance of the marketplace.With so many students signing up so quickly to Campus Job, we are working our hardest to get as many employers on board as possible, said Wessel. However, the network effect is infinitely stronger among students (who hang out at parties and live together) than it is among HR people, so its definitely a challenge that were focused on conquering by scaling our sales team.Wessel added that this new funding would be significantly invested in building out a sales team to build awareness among employers.Campus Job has raised a total of $9.1 million to date.
