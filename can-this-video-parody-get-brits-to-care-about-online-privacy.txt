After John Oliver used humor to tackle the U.S.surveillance reform debate last year,to tryto get Americans to care about online privacy via the mass medium of, er, dick picsU.K. comedy duo Cassetteboy is attempting something similar, usingits trademark video cut-up parody format to slice through all the government spin around UK surveillance legislation, and hopefully fireupthe famously reluctant British public by making them realize whats at stake for their online privacy.Every time you go online, every email you sign, Ill be watching you, says a parody of UK Home Secretary Theresa May in the video.Mayhas beenspearheading adrive to expand surveillance powers in the UK since long before the current Investigatory Powers bill was drafted, with her prior bill faltering when the governments former coalition partners refused to support it (dubbing that draft legislationa Snoopers Charter  the same moniker critics like rights group Privacy International apply to hernewsurveillancebill).Think of your own smartphone, its no longer a no-go zone. Its under attack because we will hack all of the technology you own,U.K. PM DavidCameron appears to say in anotherof Cassetteboys cut together sequences.TheInvestigatory Powers bill, which is in the process ofbeing scrutinized in detail by UK MPs, does indeed include provisions for bulk equipment interference  aka the power for state agencies to hack devices en masse. Not that youll find the real-deal David Cameron talking so plainly about the scope of the bills hacking powers.The draft legislationalso includessome weasel wording on encryption which throws doubt on the legality of end-to-end encryption, given the billcontainsclauses requiring companies to remove electronic protection. May has also previously specifiedcompanies should be able to supply data in a legible form to authorities when served with a warrant a position that is eitherfallacious or disingenuous.Meanwhile, more tech companies are rolling out end to end encryption.Only this week, for example, messaging appWhatsApp, completed theintegration of e2e encryptionacross its platform. Is the UK government seriously saying it would outlawWhatsApp?Its all the information you give to any corporation. Every conversation in every situation, every communication, every website you use, everything you do, everyday in every way, runs another stitched together sequence.The videorepurposesThe Polices Every Breath You Take as its musical backing to hammer homethe point that thelegislation aims tolegalize a regime ofmass surveillance that was only revealed, in 2013, byNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, and has since been judged illegal by multiplecourts.A new power that allows us to get your browsing history from the Internet, says another edited snippet ofMay later in the video, for once clearlydescribing the bills provision for the creation and storage of so-called Internet Connection Records  ahugely intrusive requirement that ISPs hold detailsof every website accessed by users fora full12 months.May normally prefers to describe ISCsas akin to an itemized phone bill  leaving critics to point out the folly of such a comparisonThis sums up the #IPBill quite brilliantly  https://t.co/nkIS0eMFyb David Davis MP (@DavidDavisMP) November 4, 2015Not to mention the massive data security risks when you mandateISPs store a rolling cache of web browsing dataas flagged up by theUKs Information Commissionerhimself, earlier this yearOf course the video can be accused of lacking as much nuance as the governments arguments when it comes to surveillance. But then ifyoure seeking to counter cynically disingenuousspin designed to deliberately skew the detail of the argument so as to avoid properly engaging with technical and moral complexity, well, youre entitled to be a little blunt in the rebuttal.Will the British public wake up and start caring about privacy? We can but hope so. The government is pushing hard to normalize mass surveillance this year viathe passage of thisbill onto the statute books. At a point when othersstates and regions have been forced towards surveillance policy reforms. (Even as security agencies continue theircounter push for moreaccess.)Politicalopposition to the billfrom the UK Labour partyalso does not so far extend to objecting to the principle of weblogging the entire nations browsing habits. Although the party has at least called for an independent review of the various bulk powers contained in the bill, threatening to withdraw support if the government does not listen to its complaints.But rather more drastic changes are going to be needed to see off some very clear threats to data security.
