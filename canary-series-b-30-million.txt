Canary, the smart home monitoring system, has just closed on $30 million in Series B funding led by Walden Riverwood Ventures, with participation from Cota Capital, Khosla ventures, Flextronics, Two Sigma Ventures and WTI.Canary is a small device, packed with sensors and cameras, that sits in the home and monitors everything from temperature to air quality to home security. Users are notified via a smartphone app each time the Canary detects something off in the home, and users can view recorded clips of the disturbance from anywhere in the world.The company originally launched the smart home monitoring system on Indiegogo, blasting through its $100,000 goal in a matter of hours. Since, the company raised $10 million in Series A led by Khosla Ventures and has moved into the retail space.As of the end of March, Canary had gone live on Amazon, Best Buy, Verizon, Home Depot online (with in-store availability coming soon).Cofounder and CEO Adam Sager says that in the past two months, retail has been a primary distribution channel for the startup and more will be invested in various retail partnerships over the coming months. Sager also said that most retail outlets sold out in the first few days of availability and have needed to re-order multiple times.To meet demand, the new funding will go towards expansion of the manufacturing line, as well as marketing.Canary has grown its team to 80 people over the past few years, and though Sager says there are no immediate plans to release a second-gen device, the company is working to add new features to the platform.You can learn more about the Canary here.
