Now, it seems the company isready to revitalizeFacebook Pages and transformthem into commercedestinations whereusers can not only quicklygrab business info, but as of today, also buy stuff.Today, Facebook made a pretty clear statement that Pages isshifting to become a major priority for them in terms of user traffic. BuzzFeed reported that the company had recently startedtesting shops with buy buttons inside of Facebook Pages.Its been over a year since Facebookstarted testing its buy buttonin ads on the newsfeed, and it appearsthat the company is now ready to takethe service to its next logical progressionwith dedicated shops on Pages where users can browse for and purchase items.BuzzFeed reports:The shops are still in the testing phase, but some already feature buy buttons that allow the entire shopping experience to occur within Facebook  from product discovery to checkout.With the shop section on the page, were now providing businesses with the ability to showcase their products directly on the page, Facebook product marketing manager Emma Rodgers told BuzzFeed News.Facebook is joining severalother social media giants, including Pinterest and Twitter, that are shifting to tackle commerce. Today, Google unveiled its own buy button to be built into its ads.This is a pretty major step in Facebooks marked plans to take over ecommerce and turn pages into destinationswhere users can go to grab the information they need and make quick orders. With Facebooks recent efforts of adding business hours and OpenTable integrations, its clear that the shop feature is the next step towards making Pages a more visiblepart of the user experience.If Facebook can revitalizePages and shift some of the attention (and traffic) fromthe newsfeed to them, then the company has the potential to neutralize companies like Yelp and FourSquare that have largely done a better job at crafting business landing pages for users to visit and quickly grab relevant info.This change has major potential to shift how users interact with businesses,Facebook is already completely alteringhow users discoverposts from pages that they follow.Its clear that thisfeature couldreally change the type of content strategies that businesses use in pushing out information to users. Whereas the past decades social media strategies have focused on building up engagement and brand value, its unclear whether this overt focus on making the purchasewill shift businesses to approachFacebook Pages more like their own traditional websites.
