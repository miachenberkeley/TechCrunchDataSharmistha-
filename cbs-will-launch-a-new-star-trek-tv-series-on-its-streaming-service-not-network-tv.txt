CBSs own over-the-top streaming service aimed at cord cutters has largely flown under the radar in comparison with more popular competitors like Netflix and Hulu. But now the network is hoping to change that, with the announcement that it will launch a brand-new Star Trek TV show exclusively on CBS All Access, the companys on-demand streaming service. The shows episodes, outside of a special preview broadcast, will not be available on CBSs television network, the company says.Instead, only those who pay for CBS All Access will be able to watch the new series, here in the U.S.Alex Kurtzman, who also co-wrote and produced Star Trek (2009) with Roberto Orci, and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) with Orci and Damon Lindelof, has signed on to serve as exec producer for the new Star Trek series along withHeather Kadin. Kurtzman already has a relationship with CBS, as he is also an executive producer for other CBS shows like Scorpion, Limitless, and Hawaii Five-O.Little is being revealed about the seriesitself, except that it will introduce new characters who are continuing to seek out new worlds and new civilizations, CBSs announcement states. Its also not related to the upcoming film Star Trek Beyond, notes the network.The series will be the fifth following the original series than ran on NBC from 1966-67. Other Star Trek series included The Next Generation (1987-1994), Deep Space Nine (1993-99), Voyager:(1995-2001), and Enterprise (2001-05).CBS All Access already offers every episode of all previous series.There is no better time to give Star Trek fans a new series than on the heels of the original shows 50th anniversary celebration, said David Stapf, President, CBS Television Studios, in a release. Everyone here has great respect for this storied franchise, and were excited to launch its next television chapter in the creative mind and skilled hands of Alex Kurtzman, someone who knows this world and its audience intimately.The only bad newswell, beyond the monthly price tag? CBS says the new showwont launch untilJanuary 2017.The CBS All Access service is available todayvia the CBS app on iOS, Android and Windows 10 and is through connected devices like Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and Roku. For $5.99 per month, subscribers can access7,500 episodes from the current television season, previous seasons and classic shows on-demand nationwide. Non-subscribers are still able to watch some CBS TV clips and shows in the app, but not as many.The promise of a new Stark Trek seriescould prove to be a big draw for fans,some of whom feel the concept works better as a TV showrather than infeature films. (An informal poll around TechCrunch found that our resident Trek fans would, indeed, cough up the subscription feeto watch more Star Trek.)The delay in expanding the Star Trek universe through another TV propertyhas had a lot to do with the complicated rights surrounding the nearly 50-year old franchise.CBS controls the TV side of the franchisethanks to its ownership of the Paramount TV library, explains Variety, which is how this is possible.The move makes sense for CBS, which has been bettingbigon more sci-fi and fantasy shows in recent months. For example, the premiere of its new drama Supergirl did even better than expected, making it fall TVs top new show.It then used Supergirls opening to push another techie-filled series, Scorpion, which hit a five-week high thanks to its lead-in  the best since its season premiere, Variety also reported.Those serieswould have similar audience demographics as the forthcoming Star Trek, giving CBS an opportunity to establish its own niche in the streaming landscape if handledcorrectly.But we should note that CBSs push of its streaming service is something of adeparture for the network, which has practically crippled All Accessin the past by making someof its best content unavailable.While the service today offersaccess to a number of current seasons and past seasons for a variety of CBS Shows, including The Good Wife and Blue Bloods, for example, as well as older shows like CSI: Miami or MacGyver, its few subscribers are likelyfrustrated to find that some of CBSs current shows cant be viewed in their entirety, including past seasons.For instance, All Access today only offers clips ora limited number of episodes on-demand for a coupleof its most-watched shows, Big Bang Theory and 2 Broke Girls, even for its paying subscribers. (You can watch all 6 of Big Bangs Season 9 episodes to date, but nothing else. 2 Broke Girls only has 8 clips.)And itsunclear to potential newsubscribers which CBS shows will offerfull seasons and back catalogs, and which wont.Meanwhile, CBS has oddly bet instead on making live TV streams  that is, linear TV  available on mobile and connected devices. By July, it said itslive TV coverage reached75 percent of the U.S., thanks to its growing lineup of affiliate partnerships. Today, live TV coverage is available in more than 110 markets across the U.S., the network says.In addition to being available on CBS All Access, the new Star Trek show will also be distributed to a worldwide audience by CBS Studios International though television and other services.
