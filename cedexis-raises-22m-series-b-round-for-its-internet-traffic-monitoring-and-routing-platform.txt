In addition to our traditional customer base, we were pleasantly surprised by the number of enterprises that signed on with us for primarily video delivery, with some great wins at PBS, ViaPlay, StarzPlay, JadooTV, Viewlift, etc.The company says it plans to use the new funding to expand its size and global reach, as well as to accelerate customer growth.Unsurprisingly, this means the company plans to quickly expand its engineering, marketing and sales.
