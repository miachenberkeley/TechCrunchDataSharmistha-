Amazon.com hosted a summer preview event in New York City today, and Ill be real honest: I thought there was going to be more tech stuff.Nonetheless, we soldiered on with a whirlwind tour of the cruelly summer-themed exhibits, highlighting new and popular products on sale on Amazon. Unfortunately, we couldnt demo the chainsaw or the Roomba for your lawn, but I was able to try out the Fire TV (particularly the new Sling TV app), as well as Firefly, the Fire Phone technology for identifying real-world products.(Also, I doubt anyone cares, but I should probably disclose that my roommate works at Comixology, which Amazon acquired last year.)
