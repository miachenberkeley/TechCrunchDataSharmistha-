Consulting and technology services company Accenture snatched up creative studio Chaotic Moon today. The Austin-based studio known forcoming up with crazy fire shooting drones and other design technology for major brands will now apply that same unique spark to rapid prototyping and tech capabilities within Accenture.Neither company disclosed terms of the deal, but it fits a pattern for Accenture. The company acquired Swedish digital content provider Brightstep in June and a Hong Kong-based collection of interactive companies called PacificLink Group earlier this month.Accenture launchedAccenture Interactive Innovation Center, an interactive, social media and artificial intelligence marketing arm for big brands, in May. The Brightstep, PacificLink and Chaotic Moon acquisitions are a part of fully stocking this new section within the company.The Chaotic Moon purchase helps Accenture gain a footprint in Texas as well. The studio recently expanded from headquarters in Austin to Dallas and will help Accenture make geographic inroads in both areas.But the acquisition also opens up possibilities for the Chaotic Moon team to work with more brands.
