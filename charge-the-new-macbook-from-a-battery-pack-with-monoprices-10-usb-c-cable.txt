The new MacBooks single USB-C port might lead to some concessions, but it also adds some versatility  like making it possible to use the computer with third-party power banks. And thanks to the Monoprice USB-C to USB-A 2.0 cable, its remarkably easy to make that happen, and for just tenbucks, too.Of course, $10 assumes you already have the MacBook in hand, plus an external power pack like the Limefuel 18,000 mAh unit I tested it with. And given the current estimated shipping times and store stock situations for the MacBook, that might be a tall order. But if and when you do get all the ingredients, the result is kind of magical.Kind of magical, but also kind of limited  dont expect to use mobile power banks like theyre portable versions of home wall sockets connected to the 29-watt adapter that Apple ships with the MacBook, because they just arent designed to output power at the rate the MacBook can accept it.That means youll charge slower than you would connecting to mains, and youll actually still eat battery faster than it replenishes when actively using the computer connected to a battery backup  but you can still actually restore your batterys charge when the notebook is asleep or powered down while connected to the charging pack.The backup battery I used has a total storage capacity thats rated at around twice what the MacBooks internal battery can hold. That means you should be able to get a lot of mileage out of a full charge in your notebook plus the pack, so long as youre willing to accept that the machine only recoup power very slowly for the most part with the existing generation of portable power packsFor instance, I gained only about 5% in just under half-an-hour with power off, but thats still a great arrangement if youre just carrying the notebook around at a conference in your bag all day.Chances are likely that more robust solutions designed to supply power at faster rates, aimed specifically at the MacBook, will soon emerge, so this adequate interim solution could become a very powerful future one.
