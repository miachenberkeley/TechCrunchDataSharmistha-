A number oftop pundits are predicting that messaging apps will become the new social media in 2015, and heres some evidence to support thattheory from Line, the chat app fromJapan with over 500 million registered users and 170 million monthly actives.Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney released a surprise collaboration with Kanye West on New Years Eve and I was particularly intrigued to observe how the British musicians team promoted it online.McCartney is popular on social media and was one of the first global brands to jump aboard Line, which has dedicated a large part of its business to connecting companies with users for a fee.His Facebook Page is closing in on 6.2 million likes, he has 2.17 million Twitter followersand (just) 187,000 followers on Instagram. But top billing is reserved for Line  where he has more than 10 million followers thanks to clever marketing and the use of stickers, which were offered free to fans who followed his account.So how did he get on with engagement?It isnt clear why the tweet was deleted  perhaps it didnt generate enough interest or McCartneys team was happier to promote Wests tweet  but the overall engagement numbers are interesting.Instagram comes out top in terms of sheer likes  despite a far smaller fan base. While the Instagram post makes mention that the song is available on McCartneys website there is no URLso just a small fraction of those likers may have actually taken action and listened to the song.Facebook almost certainly got more attention  withtraffic to Soundcloud, iTunes and its own video player  but the problem with posting updates to the social network is that Facebooks own algorithm dictates just how many of McCartneys fans will have seen it. Theres no way that it got served to all6.2 million fans timelines unless McCartneys team bought Facebookad space.Line does things differently, and McCartneys post went out to his fans in two ways  via a public post and private chats.The figures referred to above are from the post that McCartneys account made to its Timeline, which  as the name suggests  is a Facebook-like chronological feed of public posts available within a dedicated menu inside the Line app. There, users see all updates from their Line friends and official (corporate) accounts  like McCartneys  which they have chosento follow.Lines Timeline is governed entirely by each user without analgorithm, they only see items from people they follow and they can also block out accounts they wish to ignore.There is no way a brand can pay to plant their messages there, such as they can do on Facebook, Twitter and (now) Instagram.But, most importantly, McCartneys account also sent private chat messages to each of its 10 million-plus followers on Line. There is no metric to quantify the engagement of that action, but the fact that most of those fans will have gotten a push notification with the message and link to Soundcloud (just like an SMS) gives you an idea that it might well have been hugely effective.Indeed, on Line, the Timeline post is just a bonus. Line said in 2013that one-third of its registeredusers open their Timeline each month, andgauging the total reach of an official account on Line isimpossible.Writing for The Next Web back in 2013, I pointed out that chat apps like Line are a genuine threat to Twitter when it comes to advertising cash, and the Japanese companys December acquisition of Microsofts MixRadio service has the potential to supercharge its appeal to artists and musicians worldwide once its proposed music streaming service goes live worldwide.But Line isnt the only chat app that is rivaling social networks. WeChat is becoming the de factor mobile internet in China  itis a must for any brands seeking to reach consumers there  while the same can be said of Kakao Talk in Korea, which is installed on over 90 percent of the countrys smartphones and also offers accounts for brands.The appeal of chat apps for brands and advertisers wont just be an Asian phenomenon in 2015, however.Kik, an app that claims to have 40 percent of Americans youth on its service, recently let brands on to its platform, Snapchat is planning an Asia-style platform (and it just raised a truck load of cash). Even also-run Tango linked up with Spotify and offers a timeline-feature, while Rakuten-owned Viberintroduced a platform for high-profile usersin November.Facebook Messenger is a notable absentee from this list, but perhaps not for long. David Marcus  the former PayPal CEO who heads up Facebooks messagingbusiness  told Wiredthat he wants to reinvent messaging between people and businesses.That will almost certainly mean a systemjust like Lines, which allows companiesto pay for an account which users can subscribe to for updates. A premium tier on Line grants companiessupport for two-way conversations, thus turningthem into customer sales representatives, and Facebook may adopt that too.As forWhatsApp, the chat app Facebook bought for $19 billion, it offers an SMS replacement service rather than a platform and its foundersseem to have no plan to change that.Asias messaging apps have been around longer, and thus most have more mature business models that generate income by connectingbrands with consumers, in addition toother non-marketing revenue streams such as games and stickers.If 2014 was the year that the West wised up to the potential of messaging apps, then 2015 is the year that theyll get smart and make money from them.
