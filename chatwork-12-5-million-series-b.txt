ChatWork, a Japanese company that provides a business messaging service aimed at eliminatingemailand helping teams to work more efficiently, has raised $12.5 million in fresh funding to grow its presence in the U.S. and other markets.Wait a second. A messaging service? Aiming to beat email? Helping businesses work better?Isnt that Slack, I hear you say.Yes, Slack  the U.S. company valued at $2.8 billion  has become the tech industrys startup darling, but it is far from the only company in this space. And, theres a world outside of the tech and startup bubble, you know(!).Last year we wrote about Pie (Singapore) and Eko (U.S./Thailand) which raised money  $1.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively  to go after business audiences outside of the tech spectrum with messaging products. ChatWork is much the same, except that the company and its service have existed for five years. (ChatWork actually began as a business consultancy way back in 2000, for that matter.)ChatWork got a very early start in its native Japan, where CEO and founderToshiYamamoto tells TechCrunch it owns 70 percent of the business messaging market according to third-party analysis. This new Series B financing  which was led by Jafco and included participation from fellow Japanese investorsShinsei,SMBC andGMO is aimed at developing its user base in the U.S. and other Western markets.Yamamoto said the company has 86,000 companies from 204 countries using its service. It monetizes using a freemium model (starting at $4 per month) so all of those arent paying customers, howeverYamamoto declined to say exactly how many are paying.Yamamoto moved to the U.S. to open ChatWorks San Francisco office three years ago and while he said that competition is fierce in the country, he believes that the companys product stands above the others. (Even Slack.) Beyond group and one-on-one messaging, the ChatWork service offers file-sharing, video calling and task management in a single place.Slack has been a breakout success among tech companies, but it hasnt (yet) moved into other verticals. Thats where services like ChatWork see a real opportunity in the U.S., among less tech-savvy business professionals who will appreciate a simpler user interface and feature set.Theres also a notable feature that allows non-company representatives to participate in some chat rooms, too. So, for example, a lawyer could invite clients or customers into part of theircompanys ChatWork setup without granting access toeverything. Thatsnot possible in Slack, for now. Most chat services end up gaining feature parity fairly quickly, the larger point  which ChatWork hopes to prove  is that there is no one solution for all types of businesses.There are so many competitors [in the U.S.], Yamamoto told TechCrunch in an interview. But our major challenge is people working in very traditional ways. We have to show them that competing on a global levelin the way that they work is holding them and their teams back. Theres still a large market out there.ChatWork plans to spend its money honing its tech and product, and increasing its team of 63  which is predominantly inOsaka, Japan, with five people inSan Francisco  with 30 new hires, predominantlyin the marketing area.This is a very different approach for ChatWork, which had been a profitable company up until it raised $2.5 million last April in order to shoot for growth and scale in the traditional startup sense.Initially, I didnt want to get funding but after a couple of years in the U.S. Ibegan to understand how our competitors and other companies grow. Japanesestartup companies are very conservative, but coming to San Francisco made me change my mind, Yamamoto said, adding that the firm will also zone in on Southeast Asia and India where it sees promising organicgrowth.In the case of Southeast Asia, though, the ChatWork CEO said that the company may reevaluate its business model in light of a reticence to pay for digital goods. The decision has yet to be made, butYamamoto said that an advertising-based revenue model might bebetter suited to places like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia which the company is eying up.
