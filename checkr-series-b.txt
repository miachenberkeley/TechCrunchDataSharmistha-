Ason-demand businesseslike Uber and Instacart grow quickly, so too dothe B2B startups that service their wider ecosystem. In the latest development, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with several sources thatCheckr which runs background checks and vets potential hires by way of an API for the likes of Uber, Instacart and Handy, andother fast-growing startups like Zenefits and Weebly  is raising a Series B of at least $30 million, at avaluation north of $250 million.Whats perhaps just asnotable about the raise is whos behind it. TechCrunch understands that theround includesY Combinator, the well known startup accelerator where Checkr was a part of the Summer 2014 class.YC is actually leading the round  its first lead investment out of itsContinuity Fund.YC has yet to officially announce the size of the Continuity Fund, but its been rumored to be anywhere between $1 billion and several billion dollars more. YC has also not revealed too many details about how it will be run, althoughin July, YC president Sam Altman notedthat YC would take pro-rata investments in startups valued at less than $250 million (leaving out details of what YC would do in cases where the startups are valued at over$250 million).Others expected to participate in this round includeDavid Spector andElad Gil, two early investors in the company. With the round yet to close, there may be more VCs added to the list.Prior to this latest round, Checkr had raised just over $9 millionfrom a long list of angel investors, as well as larger VCs like Google Ventures and Accel, with the latter leadingthe companys previous round.In a nutshell, thecompany offers a quicker, cheaper and more simplified way to vet a potential worker, covering datalike social security number validation, address history, national and county criminal records and driving history. A business can run checks through Checkrs online form; or, by way of an API, it can integrate a Checkrcheck into its hiring systems and other onboarding software such as Workable and Zenefits.Checkrs business is priced per person, per report in tiersof $25, $35 and a tailored pricebased on specific requirements that may include deeper checks on motor vehicles, international searches and drug screening.From what we understand there are a few reasons why Checkr is attracting investors. First and foremost is the fact that Checkrs business is seeing a lot of traction and growth in the current startup market, but also with a lot of potential to win more dealsfrom the wider world of businessesthat need to run background checks of both temporary and permanent workers.The market for background checks isntgoing anywhere, it will be around for a very long time.They just made it easier and cheaper, one source said.Thats not to say that Checkr is alone in trying to tackle the space. Competitors includeGoodhirein the U.S., and Onfido in London. Perhaps to help stave off rivals, and to keep up with its growth, we understand that Checkrsnew funding will be used for business development and to hire more talent.Checkr, Y Combinator and other investors declined to comment for this story.
