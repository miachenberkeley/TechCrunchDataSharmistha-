Recipe-and-ingredient delivery serviceChefd ran an Indiegogo campaignlast year, but thats not the only way the team is fundingits growth. The company is also announcing that it has just raised a new round of $5.25 million.Founder and CEO Kyle Ransford has said that the point of the crowdfunding campaign was to recruit early users, not raise an enormous sum of money.The new round didnt come from a venture firm, either. Instead, it was led by Ransford and Chris Growney  Ransford said this gives the company more freedom to enter the food delivery market on its own terms.Because were not funded by traditional VCs, we havent been forced into that sort of subscription model, he said.In other words, instead of signing up for regular shipments of food, Chefd customers can buy meals individually. And many of those meals are created in partnership with food publications and celebrity chefs. For example, through Chefd, you can buy all the ingredients you need to follow this stir-fried mushroom recipe from the Vegetarian Times, or this rib eye recipe from Masterchef contest Becky Reams.He also pointed to the fact that Chefd can already deliver meals nationwide, although delivery days are a bit more limited if youre not on the West Coast. The company plans to open a fulfillment center in Philadelphia  once that happens, Ransford said Chefd will make East Coast deliveries on five days out of the week.The company has now raised a total of $6.2 million.
