You know the drill. Once a city has spoken with Google about bringing Fiber into their hood, theres a process for the city to go through. A lengthy one. Checklists. The whole nine yards.
Heres what the Google Fiber team had to say today:Today, were inviting Chicago and Los Angeles to explore bringing Google Fiber to their cities. As weve explored bringing Fiber to other metros across the U.S., weve worked to refine our checklist and prepare for building our network in different places. Now, were ready to use that same process to work with two of the biggest cities in the country. Home to a combined 6+ million people, Chicago and L.A. are the two largest metros weve engaged with to date. And with the help of gigabit Internet, Chicago and L.A. can boost their creative cultures with Internet speed to match their size.If youre keeping score at home, heres the map of where Fiber is moving across the country:While this isnt a guarantee that Fiber will come to these cities, you can bet your ass that a lot of work has already been done to make sure that theres a good shot of it happening. When? It takes a while, as I witnessed during my visit to Kansas City a few years back. And man, the shit is fast.Enjoy those checklists, Chicago and LA!
