China is turning the keen gaze of its beady censorship eye to the world of online music as part of its latest crackdown on the Internet.The national ministry of culture this week announced that, from January 1, 2016, all online music services must remove sensitive material fromtheir song libraries,according to a report from Reuters.These newpolicing will be carried out by music services themselves, with the threat of fines and other action for those who fail to cooperate.Apple, which launched its Apple Music service in China at the end of September, andlocal tech heavyweights Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, each of which operates a music streaming service, will be affected. Spotify, Rdio and Google Music are among the international services that have not yetlaunched inChina, but they would also be subject to thedirective should they landon Chinese soil.The online music business in China has traditionally been challenging thanks to widespread piracy. Both Google and Yahoo have shuttered music services in recent years, but theres new sense of optimism in the country thanks to riseof smartphones and the growth of a middle class that is prepared to spend money on services and technology, such as Apples hugely popular iPhones.China has increased its control over the Internet and online communication in recent times under the tenure ofPresidentXi Jinping. Crackdowns have included measures to force social networks to self-censor user content, the mandatory registration users of all web services, efforts to block VPN services, and eventhe placement of police inside top technology companies. China isnt just increasing its defensive efforts though, it has also used an offensive tool dubbed the Great Cannon  to shoot down Internet sites that challenge it, for examplewhen GitHub housed anti-censorship information.Music has already been a target of the government, albeit on a far smaller and more random scale. Back in August,more than 100 rap songs were removed from online music services at the request of the governmentwhich deemed them topromote obscenity, violence, crime, or threaten public morality.
