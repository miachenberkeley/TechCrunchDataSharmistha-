Last year saw Uber challenged with regulator and government battles across North America, Europe and Asia, and today China took its first step tocracking down on its fast growing taxi app space.State-run media outlet Xinhua reports that the Chinese government has forbade private cars and unlicensed vehicles from using taxi-hailing apps such as Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache  Chinas top two services  and, of course, Uber.The ministry encourages innovation and just wants to make the business develop in an orderly manner and in accordance with the law, the report added.Authorities in Shanghai detained 12 vehicles that were usingDidi Dache  which recently raised $700 millionand claims 100 million registered users and one million drivers  in December. Each driver was fined10,000 yuan, which is just over$1,600. That same month, Ubers office inChongqing was raidedby policeas part of an investigation.The development looks bad for taxi app companies at first hand  and some media have already falsely claimed that Uber is banned in China  but at this point the government is taking action against unlicensed cabs and, seemingly, regularcar owners offer rides.Xinhua reports that the app companies should ensure that all vehicles are owned by taxi or car-hire companies out of concern for passenger safety.A spokesperson for Uber China confirmed to TechCrunch that its service has not been banned in the country, and the company has issued a statement  at the bottom of this post. A ban doesnt seem to be on the cards if authorities stick to cracking down on unlicensed drivers, sinceUber Black uses limo fleets controlled by third party companies whileUber X uses a pool of licensed cars run by cab companies. Of course, Ubers status depends on how the governments crackdown develops.Uber does offer a peer-to-peer optionin the shape of its non-profit Peoples Uber, but it is not clear whether theservice  which remains in trial  will be subject to a crackdown, left alone or closed down.Didi Dache and KuaidiDache are thought to account for more than 95 percent of taxi-app bookings made in China. Thats tough competition for Uber to break. The U.S. company landed a strategic investmentfrom search giant Baidu to help make inroads in China. Baidu will help promote Ubervia its services, including its maps and search apps.Heres Ubers statement in full:Chinas top leaders recent statements have shown support for reforms and innovation. We are also pleased to see Ministry of Transportation confirming the value and benefits that innovative mobile Internet technologies bring to the transportation industry.Uber respects the key role the government plays in ensuring that its citizens have access to safe, affordable and efficient transportation options.We are actively working with authorities around the world to adopt appropriate regulations to accommodate new technologies that can help solve many of the current problems with urban transportation  congestion, pollution and lost productivity at work.We appreciate our ongoing conversations with Chinese authorities and believe that consumers and communities will continue to benefit from the progress we have seen.China has been rumored to be working to purge foreign tech suppliers, and it called out a number of globalcompanies last year, including Apple, Microsoft and Qualcomm. International technology firms generally struggle to make a mark in China  Facebook and Twitter are among the legions that are censored there, while Google withdrew its services  and it remains to be seen what Ubers longterm future in China looks like, even with the support ofBaidu.
