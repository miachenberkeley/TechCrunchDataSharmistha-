China is cracking down on VPNs, software that allows internet users to access Twitter, Facebook, Gmail and others services blocked in the country, according to state media and serviceproviders.Peoples Daily reportsthat Chinas Great Firewall internet censorship system was upgraded for cyberspace sovereignty, a move that affected theusage of at least threepopular VPN servicesand attackedothers with more vigor than usual.Strong VPN notedon its blog that it issuffering connection issues fromChina, while TunnelBear told TechCrunchit is investigating after reports fromsome China-based customers who havebeen less successful in connecting over the last few weeks.Furthermore,Astrill, a service that is well used by Chinas expat and business community, this week alerted users of issues with its iOS client.So this why my China VPN hasn't been working on IOS.

A spokesperson did notethat this weeks attacks on VPN services are more sophisticated than what weve seen in the past.The Chinese government has attempted to curtail the use of VPNs that its citizens use to escape the Great Firewall for a couple years. [The] latest attack appears to use deep packet inspection to inspect and block VPN protocols in combination with blocking specific VPN server endpoints, Golden Frog presidentSunday Yokubaitis saidin a statement.Its always difficult to speak with certainty aboutinternet censorship in China, as changes occur frequently and without warning, but more hostile tactics towards VPN services would be keeping with the governments tightening of web controls over the past nine months or so.Google services ground to a halt over the summer. While disruption always occurs around the Tiananmen Square anniversary, Gmail and other Google products remained affected for longer than usual. Alternative channels to Gmail  including POP, SMAP, and IMAP were disrupted this past month, while evidence surfaced to suggest that users of Microsofts Outlook email service had also been targeted over the weekend.The Peoples Daily report cited analysts who claimthat internet users and services should observe the network governance of the country for safety, but censorship observers argue that Chinas continued squeezing of the internet is causing problems for businesses.We wouldntgo so far to say that the authorities dont want foreigners in China,but we do believe that the increased censorship of the Chinese internet is building a lot of new barriers  its now not just about blocking access to information, Charlie Smith, the pseudonymof onefounder at censorship monitoring siteGreat Fire, told TechCrunch.Censorship has suddenly become a serious business issue. When domestic and foreign companies cannot use the internet for basic business operations, it presents a real economic hurdle, Smithadded.
