As the on-demand transportationindustrycontinues to heat up in China, one of the bigger online marketplaces for cars is also capitalizing on the growth.Bitauto Holdings  which both operates a giant car marketplace that weve in the pastdescribed as Cars.com, Consumer Reports and Auto Trader rolled into one; and also invests in transportation startups  has announced a fundraise of $300 million. The company is traded publicly and is valued at around $1.4 billion; and this latest cash injection is partly notable because of who is making it.Chinese search giant Baidu, WeChat owner Tencent and e-commerce portal JD.com are each taking investments of $50 million in Bitauto, whichis also taking an additional $150 million from PA Grand Opportunity Limited.Bitauto is not disclosing how it plans to use the money beyond general corporate purposes. The company currently makes revenuesfrom advertising, subscriptions, transactions and marketing. Its financials and other metricsare as outsized as the wider economic growth in China: the company isprofitablewith revenues on the rise, and said that in the first quarter of this year it generated 27 million sales leads and some 50,000 transactions.JD.com and Tencent were previous strategic investors, while Baidu is taking its stake as part of a new strategic partnership, in which it sounds like Bitauto will provide inventory for a new auto search on Baidu.We are delighted to announce today the strengthening of our strategic partnership with JD.com andTencent, and the establishment of a new partnership with Baidu, the leader in Chinese language online search, said Bitautos CEO William Li in a statement. We are also pleased to welcome PAG, a leading regional private investment firm, as an important investor. My personal participation in this transaction is a further testament to managements strong confidence in Bitautos future development.While the growing interest both in autos and transportation services aresigns of how Chinas economy (and specifically its middle class) continues to grow, whats also interesting is the place that Bitauto might play in the bigger global transportation game of chess.Bitautos CFO was reportedly in talks with Uber last year for the U.S. transportation behemoth to take a stake in Chinese carpooling company Dida Pinche, as part of Ubersbid to increase its footprint in the country to compete better against Didi Chuxing (formerly known as Didi Kuaidi). While Uber is the biggest and most highly valuedof all the on-demand transportation startups, more localized startups like Didi, which itself is valued in the billions, are giving it a run for its money. So why would Bitautos CFO be talking to Uber? Because Bitautois an investor in Dida Pinche, which itself has raised over $100 million.And, on top of this connection, Baidu is now a common investor between both Bitauto and Uber. It will be interesting to see how and if (and why) there are more connections are made here withUber in the wake of the Baidu connection betweenthe two.Back to todays news, Bitauto says that under the agreement,Tencent, Baidu and JD.com are eachpurchasing 2,471,577 newly issued ordinary shares of Bitauto atUS$20.23per share, corresponding toUS$20.23per American depositary share ofBitauto (ADS).The PAG investment, meanwhile, is coming in the form ofconvertible bonds thatwill be due in five years withan interest rate of 2.00% per annum.Atleast some of the investmentwill be in the form of investing to service the strategic partnerships. Bitauto had already been using strategic investments to expand its footprint:Through our cooperation over the past year with JD.com and Tencent, Chinas leaders in world-class e-commerce, social media and big data, we have gained tremendous momentum in making Bitauto the industry leader in online automobile transactions, said Li in a statement. Through our new partnership with Baidu, we expect to leverage its leadership in mobile and desktop online search, big data and transaction services platforms for additional strategic advantages as we continue to create the industry leading new and used car purchasing experience for customers in China.
