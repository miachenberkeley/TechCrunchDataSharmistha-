Theres been plenty of speculation around the future of browser maker Opera, and now that looks like it will soon be resolved.Today the Norway-headquartered company confirmed that it has received a $1.2 billion acquisition offer from a group frontedby Chinese consumer tech companies Kunlun Tech andQihoo 360.The deal is for 100 percent of the company, and it represents a 53 percent premium on the companys valuation based on its most recent trading price. Operas board said in a statement (PDF) that it has unanimously decided to recommend its shareholders to accept the bid. The final deal is subject togovernment approvals, in addition to shareholders.The consortium making the bid isGolden Brick, a group comprised of Qihoo 360, one of Chinas most visible (and controversial) Internet companies which recently went private in a $9.3 billion deal, and newly listed games firm Kunlun, which last monthsnapped up a majority 60 percent share in gay dating service Grindr. Investment firm Yonglian is the final member.There is strong strategic and industrial logic tothe acquisition of Opera by the Consortium, Opera CEO Lars Boilesen said in a statement. We believe that the Consortium, with its breadth ofexpertise and strong market position in emerging markets, will be a strong owner of Opera. TheConsortiums ownership will strengthen Operas position to serve our users and partners with evengreater innovation, and to accelerate our plans of expansion and growth.In a press release announcing the bid, the companies explained that the deal could help Opera grow its userbase in China, while giving Kunlun and Qihoo an outlet for user acquisition, too:The transaction would give Opera access to theextensive internet user base of Kunlun and Qihoo in China as well as the financing and other supportof the Consortium that would allow for the full potential of the Company to be realized. At the sametime, Kunlun and Qihoo would be able to cross-sell their products and services to the Opera userbase, and benefit from Operas leading mobile advertising platform.Opera, which claims a userbase of 350 million on mobile and desktop devices and was previously linked with an acquisition from Facebook, said last year that it was exploring a sale after missing financial targets due to sluggish ad sales. The company was one of the first to pioneerbrowsers made for mobile, and it enjoyed an early start on mobile thanks to itscompression technology(which shrinks data down to save on a users bill), small sized app, and bundling deals with carriers, particularly in emerging markets.Beyond the browser, Opera has invested massively in its mobileadvertising business which now includes app install ads  and other acquisitions have includedVPN service SurfEasy, andsubscription-based mobile-app-discovery service Bemobi.Acquisition rumors ramped up when Operapostponed its planned earnings release this week. Now that this offer is out in the public domain, Opera will hold its Q4 2015 earnings call today at07:30am CET  theres plenty to discuss.
