Circle Medical, launching from this summers Y Combinator batch, isa full service medical practice that will come to you.While other doctor-on-demand startups have existed for a while, Circle Medicals goal is to provide a service that can used asa regular part of your life, not just in emergencies or last-minute situations.To achieve this, the startup focuses on two pain points that traditionally keep patients tied town to a physical practice.First, Circle Medical is considered in-network for over 97 percent of patients in California who have private insurance.This means a visit normally costs no more than your regular doctor, and often less.The secondunique aspect ofCircle Medical is that all of its doctors are full time. This means you can pick a doctor and have them become your new primary care physician.The app shows you aprofileand background on all of the companys doctors, as well as allows you to scan your insurance card and see potential copays in advance.Circle Medicalwas founded byBrent LaRue,George Favvas, andJean-Seabstien Boulanger. The three say that the service should be used just as a patient would use their regular doctors office.This means the service specializes in things like annual checkups, flu shots, and blood testsnot just time-sensitive urgent care issues. Doctors will bring a medical kit as well as privacy blinds, and can meet either in your home or office.Interestingly, doctors are actually getting paid a little more working for Circle Medical as opposed to working for a traditional practice.Favvas explained that in a physical practice doctors typically get 20-30 percent of what is billed to insurance, with the rest going to overhead costs physical space, staff, and other costs that Circle Medical avoids. Circle Medical circumvents these additional costs, passing on savings to the patient and doctor.The service operates seven days a week from 8am  8pm, and is currently available anywhere in San Francisco. Interestingly, the doctors currently use Uber as their method of transportation from appointment to appointment, but Favvas said this may change in the future.Circle Medical can be downloaded now on the iOS App Store.
