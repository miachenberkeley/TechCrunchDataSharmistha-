As crowdfunding sites like Tilt and GoFundMeand lending site Funding Circleraise large rounds to take their businesses to the next level, a startup that sits in the same area of web-based fundraising is trying a new approach.CircleUp, a crowdfunding platform forconsumer brands to raise money fromaccredited investors, has closeda $22 millionfund of its own to back a range of brands on the platform.The Consumer Growth Fund, as itis called, will matchinvestments made on its platform by others  nottake the lead on funding itself, in order to avoid conflict with other investors.The size of the fund nearly matches the amount CircleUp has raised for its own business. To date the company has picked up over$23 million from investors that include Canaan Partners, Google Ventures, Union Square Ventures and Maveron, among others.While companies like Kickstarter have been known to makeoccasional investments in startups that are raising money on their platforms, CircleUps COO and co-founder Rory Eakin says this $22 million fundis a first no other crowdfundingmarketplace has raised a fund to invest in deals on its own platform before.Unlike AngelList, which focuses on tech startups, or Kickstarter or Indiegogo with their mix mainly of hardware and creative projects, CircleUp is used primarilyby businessesthat are not techin their focusbut are using advances in technology(including CircleUps fundraising platform) to grow.CircleUp tapsinto a wider trend were seeing in the U.S. and other markets. The number of smaller, new brands hitting the market has been blowing up in recent years  propelled by a wave of consumer sentiment away from mass market products and towardsmore local, organic and less commonalternatives. CircleUp estimates that large packaged-goods companies have lost around $4 billion in the U.S. alone in the last year to smaller producers.Among typical examples and funding sizes on the platform, Bhakti Chai raised $850,000 on CircleUp; andsportswear brand Hylete raised $1.4 million.Up to now,CircleUp has focused on individual investors backingspecific businesses, either on their own or through Circles, diversified investment fundsintroduced on the platform last yearthat are led by individual investors or organised around a specific theme. Theseare rolling investment vehicles that appear to work similar to AngelList syndicates.CircleUpsexisting businesshas already seen some traction, with100 businesses collectively raising over $100 million on the platform since 2012, and more individual investments in the last month than in the 15 months before that. (CircleUp is selective about who it permits to raise on its platform, vetting the companies itself before giving a green light.)On top of funding, it also has built a network of relationships with larger strategic businesseslike General Mills, J&J and eBay, which the smaller companies can tap with questions.The average company has grown 90 percent per year afterraising funds, but so far there have been no exits through sales or other liquidityevents.Eakin says that onereason why CircleUpdecided to widen its remit to raising a fund is because ithad been approached by investors whowanted to get involved in backing businesses on the platform but didnt have the scope to pursue individual investments themselves.The fund, which is managed by Jayson Yuan, has about 50 LPs  including consumer product execs like the CEO of Annies, John Foraker; former vice chairman of Walmart, Eduardo Castro-Wright; finance professionals like the ex-CEO of the NYSE, Duncan Niederauer; and many family offices.These investors can now access an asset class theyve never reached, without needing to pickand choose the companies themselves, he says. He adds that the fund was originally intended to be $20 million but was oversubscribed.Eakin believes that the Growth Fund marks a seminal shift: Crowdfunding is often synonymous with small investors, but the fundpoints to how it can be appropriateddifferently, as a robust online equity marketplace with various products and services for different types of investors.Indeed, whatsinteresting to consider is that this modelcould potentially develop as a vehicle for future funding on the site.Eakin says the company has been approached by several parties already interested in raising another fund to invest across businesses listed on CircleUp.Weare exploring options with more than one right now, he adds. Ultimately, our goal is to create a vibrant private capital market that helps more entrepreneurs thrive by giving them the resources they need to grow. Funds managed by experienced consumer and retail investors efficiently managed through the platform fits into that vision in the long-run.CircleUp charges a commission of 5 percent to companiesthat raise capital on its platform, with no other fees. The fund will be run somewhat differently. It will charge the investors and will take both management and performance fees. The terms of these are confidential but Eakin says that they are between two percent and 20 percent.
