Only about 6 percent of the countrys biggest cities are planning for or thinking about autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars in their long-range transportation plans,accordingto the National League of Cities.Whats even more surprising is that only 3 percent of these cities transit plans are even taking into account the impact of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft even though they already operate in 60 of the 68 largest markets in the U.S.Thats according to a content analysis of transportation planning documents from the countrys 50 most populous cities.Change is coming fast. Seven auto manufacturers and technology companies including Cadillac, Tesla, Google, Volvo, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan have said they expect to bring driverless cars to market by 2020.This mismatch is kind of a big deal because the key driver in whether autonomous vehicles will lead to a neo-dystopian repeat of themid-20th century policiesthat fueledsprawl and isolated livingin neighborhoods with little walkability or not is land-use policy.If you look at the chartbelow, that is the difference between a pre-automobile designed neighborhood and a post-automobile designed neighborhood. Its mucheasier to take the density up on agridlayout than it is on a suburban street structure, where there are lots of curvilinear streets and cul de sacs. Once all those street forms and lot sizes are set in place, theyre almostimpossible to change because most ofthe parcelsareowned privately.The concern is that if suburban governments shirk at designing better, more compact physicalspace, the additional efficiencies and comfortsofself-driving cars will just induce longer mega-commutes and more sprawl, which is bad for the environment.Lots of peninsula andSilicon Valley suburbs oppose more housing construction because they arerightfully concerned about more traffic congestion; they may not have the right street and parcel structure to handle more population and employment growthat the moment.But autonomous vehicles and fleets of on-demand transportation services could changesomeof that. For example,it could liberate the 25 percent of physical space in downtown San Francisco that is currently devoted to on-street parking. Or it could open up garage spaces in urban areas to ground-floor retail or additional housing units. An OECD study using commuterdata from Lisbon argued that the city couldoffer the same level of mobility with 10 percent of the vehiclesif it used Robo-taxis.Ive been on a few panels in the lastcouple of weeks with representatives from companies like Lyft, Uber, Google andsome major public transit agencies in cities like Dallas.In one panel for the American Public Transit Association last month, I tried to ask everyone whether self-driving cars favored density or sprawl.No onecould reallysay.Thatsbecausea huge part of the question is up to urban andsuburban governments in how they craft policy aroundphysical environments. On Friday, at the National League of Cities conference in Nashville, Gabe Klein, a former Zipcarexecutive who was a transit director under both mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and former mayor Adrian Fenty of Washington D.C., told methat cities should actually stopadding extra highway lanes and parking lots today.Kleinsaid that citiesshouldnt just passively accept technology for technologys sake, but instead build the ideal urban environment that they want driverless cars to fit into.There are lots of interesting designquestions to ask:Then one of the very biggest questionsis will driverless cars cause the public to disinvest in mass transit? A lot of folksfrom journalists to transit policy makers have raised thisconcern. In Florida, a state senator Jeff Brandes, is opposing investments in light rail because driverless cars will come online by the timethe project is finished.Its concerningbecause no one actually knows how much efficiency self-driving cars can reallyprovide. Itcould be a repeat of the 1940s when streetcar lines in U.S. cities like Los Angeleswere dismantledto make way for cars and buses.On the tech companyside, the story varies considerably. It really depends on the company youre talking about.Lyft, for example, launched a program last week called Friends With Transit that advocates partnerships with public transit agencies so that riders can use Lyft in conjunction with fixed-line transit.The company sees ride-hailing and public transit working in tandem and is a big advocate of more spending on public transit. The thinking is that the public sector canhandle the multi-billion dollar infrastructural and fixed-line investments in rail lines and subwaysthat the privatesectorwill neverbe ableto do, while ride-pooling and on-demand rides fills in gaps and handleslast-mile problems.I do not know all the answers to these questions, nor do any of the companies, cities or the federal government.There are too many moving partsfromthe pace of technological advancement to land-use policy to individual consumer behavior.But the point is we should start debatingall these questions now.
