Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.After the clean tech boom went bust, the industryseemed to disappearfromthe techworlds focus as quickly asthe billions of dollars that had been invested.But one sector  energy efficiency has made a quickcomeback with a little help from the Internet of Things. And the same investors that got burned beforeare rushing backto try their handin a new version of theold game.Veteran Silicon Valley firmKleiner Perkins Caufield & Byerstook a particularly hard hitin the clean tech crash, when portfoliocompanies such asFisker Automotiveand MiaSolwent belly up and lost the firm hundreds of millions of dollars. But partnerTrae Vassallo has not been deterred  instead, shes leading a second pass at energy tech that has already spawnedwinners such asNest,acquired by Google for $3.2 billion, and Opower, which went public in April of last year.Its really been made possible only recently just by the incredible proliferation of mobile devices, our ability to do mesh networking intelligently, and to have a really inexpensive microchip that can do the processing, saysVassallo,referring toher portfolio company Enlighted.The first wave, which in many cases didnt work out so well, was about funding development of core physics around energy generation, says Scott Harmon, CEO of Noesis, a lendingmarketplace that provides capital to energy-saving commercial building projects. This time around, however, most of the VC money is flowingto things like financing and automation systems and digital software  things that frankly venture people know better and are more comfortable with, Harmon says.According to CrunchBase data, this second wave of energy tech is gaining traction in the venture community. Venture investments in Internet of Things and smart building startups have risen steadilyover the past few years, accounting fornearly 40% of all clean energy rounds in 2014 compared to 20% in 2012. Connected device startupsandSaaS companies likeNest and Opowerarethe new leaders of the venture-backed pack, seeingbroad adoption with a vastly smaller burn rate than the Solyndras of the past decade.In the home, Nest is a clearwinner. But a winner in commercial buildings has been slower to emerge.If you look at who dominates technology in buildings today, its these old industrial companies, the Honeywells and the Siemens, says Vassallo. Those guys dont know cloud, they dont know data, its not like theyve got platforms with APIs and things like that.Its clear theres a lot of money at stake here the global building automation and controls market is going to reach $55 billion by 2020. Yet the financing challenges have been a major blocker for widespread adoption so far.One company that might be the breakthrough in this arena of commercial buildings isEnlighted, a lighting control sensor and analytics platform thats raised over $55 million in venture funding to date.If you put a sensor at every single light in the building, guaranteed you can see every square inch of a building, because light shines everywhere, says Enlighted CEO Joe Costello, its a perfect symbiotic relationship.By 2014, after four years in business, Enlighted had signed up121 different customers, including 50 Fortune 500 companies, and was seeingan average of 60 to 70 percent savings on lighting and energy bills.But installing the systemwas expensive. The blockage was always, we cannot get the capital allocated, says Costello. Not surprisingly, facilities departments dont typically getdibs when it comes to allocatingthe budget of a large company.Your average control system or lighting system might cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and one of the big impediments to a building owner is that they dont have that budget reserved to pay for it all at once, says Harmon, especially if the system isnt worn out and the lights and the air conditioning still come on every day.Enlighteds solution is the Global Energy Optimization (GEO) program. Enlighted installs the network completely and takes responsibility for all financing and maintenance. At the end of the contract, typically a 4-10 year period, the money saved in energy bills benefits the company and Enlighted gets paid.The thing thats so cool about it, from the customers point of view, is that you dont pay any capital, its not a lease, so theres no debt or overhang, says Costello.The financing issue is also being tackled byNoesis, a company thats taken a page out of the SolarCity playbookto fund the energy efficiency projects of its customers.Noesis is working with over150companies to provide financing for commercial energy efficiency and solar projects,ranging from commercial HVAC companyTrane to private LED lighting system provider Titan LED. These companiesrepresent about $10 million weekly and $1.1 billion annually in proposed projects.Once facilities departments are financially ableto integratenew technologyinto commercial spaces, startups will have a major opportunity to innovate in alargely untouchedsector and the applications of these systems are only going to get more interesting.Enlighted is still figuring out how to maximize the utility of this alien eye, the ability to monitor movement throughheat without the privacy issues that accompany a camera. Theyve got three apps in alpha and beta right now, which Costello hints are focused on space planning and facilities management.This is just the tip of the iceberg.Imagine a world filled withconnected buildings, where when an earthquake hits onebuilding, alarms go off inbuildings ten miles awayto warn people before the shaking begins. And when firstresponders arrive on the scene,they can pull up an imagewith thepreciselocation of every occupant in the building.What Im excited about here is that youre taking this notion of distributed intelligence and youre putting it into the building in a way that turns this building into a really intelligent platform, says Vassallo.I think when we look back in five years, what were going toseearethese pioneers like Enlighted in the commercial building, Nest in the home, and other people on the body or in the car that are really taking these physical things like buildings or cars and turning them into these very interesting computing platforms.
