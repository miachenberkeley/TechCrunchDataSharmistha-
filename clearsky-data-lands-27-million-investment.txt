ClearSky Data has come up with an interesting approach to solve the data storage cost and speed problem. Today it was rewarded with a $27 million Series B round to continue the mission.The company came out of stealth in August with a plan to offer customers a multi-tier, fully managed, hybrid data-management solution. In practice this involves an appliance thats installed in your data center (or in AWS or Azure) and houses the companys most important hot data, a second level of storagestored at a co-location facility within 120 miles of a customerdeals with somewhat important or warm data and finally Amazon S3 storage for stuff you dont need all that often or cold data.The idea is that you can reduce cost by distributingthe data across these tiers, with the data you need the most stored closest to you for the least latency. The secret sauce is the software and algorithms that manage all of it and moves the data betweenthe various tiers automatically based on usage patterns, policy and customer requirements.The company also handles otherdata management tasksincluding de-duplication,backup and disaster recovery.The round was led by Polaris Partners, with a strategic investment from Akamai Technologies. Previous investors General Catalyst and Highland Capital Partners also participated. With todays investment, the company has raised $39 million across two rounds.There is a tremendous market opportunity in storage in general, but ClearSkys founders havebeen able to build a sophisticated solution thatsolves a bigproblem, according to Dave Barrett from lead investor Polaris Ventures. He says, thats what attracted him to the company.Its not easy to do. There is a tremendous amount of storagechops and algorithmic magic that goes into what theyve built, he said.ClearSkyreally had its coming out party this Fall at VMworld and Amazon re:invent, company CEO Ellen Rubin told TechCrunch. Its not easy for a new player to get attention, but the fact that traditional storage market leaders like EMC are suddenly distracted didnt escape her notice or visitors to the company booth.She says ClearSkysproduct is aiming for the more adventurous side of the market and companies that would be buying from more traditional storage vendors are not necessarily the target market here.The customers that will try ClearSky in the next couple of years will be on early adopter side of the spectrum, she pointed out. These customers are trying to find new ways to solve their storage problem and get out of the data center management business while theyre at it.She sees her company as different from even more modern storage players like Pure Storage (which recently went public). Thats becauseClearSkys solution takes customers out of the storage provisioning and management business and leaves all of the heavy lifting to her company, Rubin explained.Rubin would not say how many customers her company has atthis point, but she did say that some of its earliest Beta customers are in the process of becoming paid customers and she would be able to share specific numbers at a later date.ClearSky is based in Boston and currently has co-location facilities runningin Boston, Philadelphia and most recently Las Vegas.The company has 40 employees and Rubin said that sheis planning on using some of the new funding to add additional personnel and begin to expand the business to other locations around the country and the globe.
