Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will chair the Senate subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness, providing him withan oversight roleof theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, better known as NASA.That slight twingeyou felt was the proper emotion. The Senator, by way of a single example, tried to reduce NASA funding to be, in his view, compliant with a Federal spending cut. His amendmentfailed on a party-line vote.TheHuffington Post noted, when covering the Senators new gig, that he has disputedthe scienceof climate change. And, as the same article points out, NASA has conducted research on climate change, making for something of an awkward combination. (Heres NASAs climate page, if you are so inclined.)Elections have consequences.Heres NASA:In its recently released Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded theres a more than 90 percent probability that human activities over the past 250 years have warmed our planet.And here is the Senatorkicking it with CNN:The last 15 years, there has been no recorded warming. Contrary to all the theories that  that they are expounding, there should have been warming over the last 15 years. It hasnt happened, said Cruz.Cruz spoke to CNN in an exclusive interview following an event here to promote his new energy plan, which he says he will formally introduce in the Senate next week.When pressed about the fact that the arctic is melting, and whether that helps prove climate change is real, Cruz dismissed it.Other parts are going up. It is not  you know, you always have to be worried about something that is considered a so-called scientific theory that fits every scenario. Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, theyll say, well, its changing, so it proves our theory, argued Cruz.This should be fun!
