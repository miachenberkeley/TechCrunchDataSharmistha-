So this happens to me pretty often: I pull up an online video that I want to watch, only to be taken aback when I realize that its 10 or 20 or 30 minutes long. Its particularly frustrating when theres just one section or just one quote that Im looking for. I end up skipping aroundtrying to find that one bit  not exactly a great experience.A new startup is trying to fix that. WithClipMine, you get searchable videos, with a table of contents.For example, heres a curated collection of videos related to startups. With each video, not only can you see an outline of all the big topics covered and jump to the section that interests you, you can also search for every time something gets mentioned (though your success will depend on how thoroughly the video has been tagged and annotated).Lets say you wanted to see Y Combinators Sam Altman and Asanas Dustin Moskowitz talk about starting a startup  but youve already got an idea, so you really wantto know how to turn it into a viable product. Well, you just find the product section in the TOC and skipahead.To be clear, ClipMine isnt trying to build its own video player. Instead, it sits on top of players like YouTube. (You can also install a plugin to see the ClipMineplayer anywhere you see YouTube videos.) Founder and CEO Zia Syed said his aim is to build the personalization engine, the metadata layer for the video ecosystem.The initial annotations were created by the startups editorial team, with help from the companys algorithms, which automatically suggest annotations. Over time, ClipMine is hoping to build up a community of annotators. Anyone can add enter a YouTube, Vimeo or Dailymotion URL and start creating annotations, or they can add content to an already-tagged videos (though theres an approval process for popular videos that might attract trolls).In the initial usage, Syed said that ClipMine has improved engagement rates for videos by around 50 percent. In addition, he said that video publishers can get more data  not just how many people watched their video and for how long, but also the specific sections they clicked onand the topics they were interested in.And hey, if anyone wants to start annotating TechCrunch videos, be my guest.
