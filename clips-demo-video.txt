I could try to tell you about Clips. I could explain how it was created by startup Fly Labs, or I could describe how it makes it easy to combine clips on your iPhone into a single video, then add music, voiceover and effects.But you know what sounds more fun? Going to the park with CEO Tim Novikoff, helpinghim to shoot some footage and watchinghim edit it all together with Clips. So thats what we did. (We could have tried to edit the whole demo video in Clips, too, but that would probablyhave been taking things too far.)Even though our conversation focused on the Clips app, Fly Labs has actually built four apps so far, each of them focused on a different aspect of editing  Tempo, Fly and Crop.
