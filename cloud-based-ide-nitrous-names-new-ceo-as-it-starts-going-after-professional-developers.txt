Nitrous, thecloud-based code editor and integrated development environment that recently raised a $6.65 million funding round, today announced that it hasbrought on CoreOS and GitHub alum Alex Malinovich as its CEO. Nitrous current CEO and co-founder Andrew Solimine is now the companys VP of product.During his time at GitHub, Malinovich managed and grew GitHub:FI into the companys GitHub Enterprise service. At the container-focused CoreOS, he built the companys first sales time and worked on its Tectonic platform. It looks like hell be able to bring these two worlds together at Nitrous as the company sets its aim at the professional developer market in a world where being able to quickly deploy to containers is becoming increasingly important.Alex MalinovichThe Nitrous teamtold me the service has over 200,000 developers on its platform and its recently launched Pro service(which, despite its name, also offers a free tier) is quickly gaining steam. In the companysview, Nitrous flagship collaborative online code editor made the service extremely attractive to hobbyists and students early on  and that product isnt going away. And while pros like the service for the same reasons, Malinovichalso believes there is still a lot to do, especially around deployment and automation.For the most part, this means integrating with third-party tools that developers are already using, but it also means making it easier for developers to use containers. Because Nitrous already uses containers (every Nitrous workspace already runs in a separate container), it should be relatively easy to use that existing infrastructure to ship code for testing and deployment, too.The teamalso noted that even though Nitrous obviously offers an online code editor, developers with paid accounts can still use their own tools by using Nitrous desktop sync app (or SSH into their servers and still use vim). So even if they arent quite ready to give up their editor, they can still use Nitrous to quickly set up their Ruby or Meteor development stacks and use the service to share their code with others.
