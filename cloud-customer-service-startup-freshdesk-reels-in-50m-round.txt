Freshdesk, a cloud-based customer service tool, caught a bushel of money today, announcinga $50M investment led by Tiger Global with Accel Partners and Google Capital also participating.The funding comes on the heels of a $31M round last June and brings the total investment to just over $95M. The reason Freshdesk went back for more so soon, was that ithas continued itsphenomenal growth, and investors took the bait.Freshdeskhas been on a growth spurt, doubling the number of customers to 40,000 in the last year and increasing an impressive ten-fold over two years ago when ithad just 4,000. As its added clients, it has required more employees, doubling the numberfrom last year to 350 today, according to company president Dilawar Syed.With $50M in newmoney, chances are it will be hiring a few more, but unlike many SaaS companies, Fresdesk isnt burning through money building a costly sales and marketing organization. Instead the company focuses on SMBs (small to medium sized businesses) and uses in-bound marketing campaignsto keep costs down, Syed explained.While he acknowledges that as the company grows, it will need to build a bigger in-house sales team, he seems to take pride in running lean and hopesto concentrate futureinvestments onproduct development and support. This is a far different approach from the typicalstartups focus on bulkingup sales and marketing with new funds.Freshdesk, which launched in 2010, has been built from the ground up as a cloud tool designedto work across a variety of channels including phone, web, email and chat, as well as social channels like Twitter and Facebook. Freshdesk helps manage and prioritize customer issuesas they come in, and distributes them to appropriate customer service personnel.Employeescan organize inquiries using a set of filters such asbyagent or priority. Administrators can configure the system to set a standard time for responding to a customer request, sometimes called a service level agreement (SLA).Freshdesk is competing with the likes of Zendesk, which went public last year with a successful IPO, and Salesforce.com, which offers a number of customer service tools aimed at SMBs and larger enterprises. YetSyed didnt seem terribly concerned about them.He admitted that, while the threecompanies sometimes overlap, when it comes to Freshdesks core SMB market, it is usually competing against using email to interact with customers, as opposed to another customer service product.Its worth noting that both Zendesk and Salesforce offer productsaimed at SMBs and were also built from the ground up as cloud services.Judgingfrom its customer list, its not justgoing after SMBs, andSyed acknowledgesit has set its sights on bigger customers too. In fact,customer examples listed on the company website include Cisco, Honda, 3M, Sony Pictures and Good Reads. In many cases, it may start with a presence in one department inside a large organization, and then tryto expand to other departments, as opposed to attemptinga company-wide sales approach, Syed explained.As Freshdeskhas grown rapidly,Syed admits he worries about managing the large number of new customers, while on-boarding new employees, but he has a plan for the company and so far he has been able to execute it to continue growing.He says one of the reasons it has worked so well to this point is the simplicity of the product, which he claims allows the company to get new customers up and running quickly without consultants or third parties.As for the future,he wouldnteven touch the idea of going public at some point, saying it was too soon to say. He was reluctant to even project how many employees he might have by next year, but said its entirely possible it could double again.For now, Freshdesk is growing without the kind of burn rate we are used to seeing from SaaS companies. If it can continue its current trajectory, while keeping the sharks at bay, the rest will surely take care of itself.
