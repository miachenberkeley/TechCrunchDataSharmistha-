CloudFlare has secured a $110 million round of private financing, led byFidelity, and participated in by a cadre of technology giants, including Baidu, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm. The round actually closed last December, but the company decided not to disclose it until today. The company has now raised more than $180 million to date.The quickly growing startup now operates in more than 30countries, and, according to material provided to TechCrunch, processes around 5percent of the Internets traffic. The company last secured a $50 million round in late 2013.CloudFlare launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2010, making them an alum of the event that your humble team is currently putting on. The company is refreshingly open about its finances, noting that it has been profitable since 2014, and currently puts up a gross margin of 75 percent.A profitable company that is, at the same time, looking into international expansion might seem odd. CloudFlare is. The firm has grown incredibly quickly, helping it to attract the capital that it needs.The companys new influx of funds comes during a particularly frothy moment in technology. Discussions of a bubble are the current lingua franca of journalists, and the bte noire of budding capitalists. Its worth noting that $110 million is a massive sum, but in the age of Ubers billion-dollar raises, it isnt out of the realm of normalcy.The companysexpansion, however, does come with certain requirements. That the firm took funds from Baidu isnt an accident. Doing business in China, a massive market for the Web and its larger requirements (the bread and butter of CloudFlare), entails more than entering other locales. Being a partner of a local technology giant in good graces with the government is never abad strategy.As CloudFlare announced last week, ithas now entered the Chinese market through a partnership with Baidu. CloudFlare now has a presence in 17 Baidu data centers in China and expects this number to grow in 2016.In a release, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince said there is an inevitability around [their]business. That is true to an extent, given the massive growth of not merely the desktop Internet, but the mobile web, as well. However, this particular inevitability is more a market pitch than a business secured; CloudFlare has competition, and its success will only attract more.There are worse problems to have.CloudFlare is joining us today onstage, and we intend to drill them on their finances, growth and expansion plans. To that end, the company has stressed international growth, and expansionin the mobile space. Its almost like the Internet is global.
