CloudFlare, the security-focused content delivery network, already protects its customers from DDoS attacks and other attacks, but today, the company is taking another step to ensure its customers remain in control of their sites. CloudFlare is launching a domain registry service  CloudFlare Registrar  thatprotects high-profile sites from domain hijackings and domain expiration (because they forgot to renew their domains). This service will be available to CloudFlares paying Enterprise customers.As CloudFlare argues, a domain name is only as secure as the security of the registrar that maintains it. Most registrars focus on consumers, though, and not high-profile sites  and hence their focus isnt necessarily on security or their standards arent as high as you would expect from an enterprise-centric site.By offering registrar services to CloudFlare Enterprise customers, we instantly eliminate the additional risk a third-party registrar may overlook, said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare, in todays announcement. Even in CloudFlares own search for a high-security registrar, we didnt find anything that met our security standard. Rather than waiting for one to come onto the market, we built our own, fundamentally changing the way Registrar security is offered today.So how does CloudFlare secure domain names? Instead of using a single password for access to the registrar, CloudFlare Registrar users can opt to secure their domains by setting up a formal approval chain that includes multiple stakeholders who all have to agree to any change. That adds a lot of friction, but in this case, thats probably exactly what youd want. In addition, CloudFlare also uses two-factor authentication for accessing all accounts.The company also promises that domains registered with CloudFlare Register willnever expire. Domains will automatically renew a full year before they are scheduled to expire. This mitigates the risk of missing an email your registrar sent you a month before the domain expires.In addition, CloudFlare also locks all domains to prevent unauthorized access.
