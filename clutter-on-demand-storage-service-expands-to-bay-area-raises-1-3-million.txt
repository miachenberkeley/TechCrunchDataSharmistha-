Clutter, the on-demand storage service based out of Los Angeles, has today announced that it has expanded its offering to cover all of the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also announced that it has raised an additional $1.3 million in funding, bringing total funding to $3.3 million.The idea behind Clutter is simple. Through a website, users can put in an order to have anything stored, whether it be a few bins of winter clothes or an entire five-bedroom home. Within 48 hours, a Clutter mover will show up, do all the packing for you, and take away your well, clutter.However, Clutter is different from some other on-demand storage services in that it goes beyond what you can fit in a bin. Clutter employs moving professionals (on a W2 basis) that can deal with moving your five-piece sectional couch, taking your mounted flatscreen off the wall and wrapping it in bubble wrap, and anything else a moving professional can do.The company originally launched in the city of Los Angeles and then expanded to the entirety of Los Angeles County, and on to Orange County, and Ventura County and is now hitting up the Bay Area.We dont buy our own real estate for storage centers, said CMO Ari Mir. Instead, we rent out space in existing warehouses and facilities, which we guard ourselves, and that makes expansion far more cost-effective for us.Clutter plans on using the new financing to expand to other areas and build out the workforce.If you want to learn more about Clutter, hit up the website here.
