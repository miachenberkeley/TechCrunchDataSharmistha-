Clutter, the storage service that uses professional movers to load and unload your stuff, has today announced the close of a $9 million in Series A funding, led by Sequoia. As a part of the deal, Sequoia partner Omar Hamoui, who led the round, is joining the Clutter board. Clutter operates under a simple premise. Instead of spending capital on its own storage facilities, it leases small portions of already-existing storage centers and adds its own monitoring and climate controls (if necessary). That capital instead goes toward hiring professional W2 movers who are trained to go way beyond lugging bins from your apartment to the truck. These workers are able to package and load heavy pieces like couches, antique furniture, as well as your flat-screen TV mounted on the wall. Of course, as soon as a user wants their goodies back, they can simply schedule a drop-off on the website. Pricing is also a differentiator for Clutter, which uses pretty conversational wording to express their different packages. For example, the company offers the Item Plan at $7/month (which covers a few boxes), the Closet Plan for $75/month, the Garage Plan (which fits everything that can go in a one-car garage) for $175/month, all the way to the Studio Plan and Apartment Plan. Clutter also offers custom plans if youre trying to store a mansion or some otherwise ridiculous amount of old crap (in which case, you need to look at your choices, look at your life). As of May, Clutter said its average storage time per client is around 1.5 years, but given that the company launched in 2013, we could see that length increase. Clutter currently operates in Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey and the Bay Area. This latest round of funding brings Clutters total amount raised to $12.3 million.
