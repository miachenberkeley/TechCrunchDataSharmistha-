If youre a tutor looking to offer your services online, a startup called Coach aims to give you the tools you need.CEO Spencer Fry created a similar platform, in some ways, when he co-foundedCarbonMade, which offers designers and artists an easy way to showcase their portfolios online. He said theres a bigger challenge with Coach, though, because there are more pieces to the product.So what is Coach actually offering? It includes a website builder, an online payment system, a public calendar for scheduling, publishing tools for supplemental content, a customer database for tracking students and the ability to get support from Coach team members and other users.On their own, none of these features might sound particularly unique, but Fry suggested that no one has brought together the business tools and the marketing piecein this kind of package. We think of it as a hub of your business that allows you to do everything you need to do, kind of a Squarespace meets a Square, he said.Fry also emphasized that Coach is an open platform. In other words, this isnt about building a single marketplace for tutors and students, but rather giving tutors the tools they need to connect with students on their own websites. At the same time, he said it could eventually become more of a marketplace in the sense that it will help its users find new clients.Coach currently makes money by charging a transaction fee on payments. In the future, Fry said it will also introduce a paid plan with features like custom domains.You can read more about Frys vision at this interview he did with his investors at Notation Capital.
