Tech companies have gotten better about disclosing their diversity data, but there are still a ton of companies that havent done so. In the reports thatdoexist, whats often missing are insights around retention rates, which can be good indicators of a companys culture and what its like to actually work there. I recently sat down with CODE2040 CEO Laura Weidman Powers to talk about that and more. Below is a lightly edited Q&A.Megan Rose Dickey:What is CODE2040 and why does the organization specifically focus on blacks, Latino/as?Laura Weidman Powers:CODE2040 is a non profit. We work with tech companies to help them gain access to more diverse talent and we work with black and Latino college students to help smooth the pathway into the industry. We decided to focus on blacks and latinos specifically because they are quite underrepresented in silicon valley in technology but theyre actually less underrepresented in computer science. so, 18% of computer science undergrad degrees go to black and Latino students, but you see numbers closer to 5% at companies, so theres a real opportunity for companies to access the talent thats already out there.MRD:How have some of the students fared in the real world? What are some success stories?Weidman Powers:This past summer, we had 35 students in the fellows program. Ninety percent of those students get full time offers at their tech companies, which is pretty great.MRD:Is there any sort of guarantee youre offering students?Weidman Powers: The guarantee is that they are part of the CODE2040 family and well be there to support them in their career moving forward. Often because they do so well, they get a job offer out of it. But even those students who dont get a return offer get an offer at another tech company, so 100% of our alums are working in tech in some way, shape or form.MRD:What else do you think needs to happen in tech industry in order to create a truly diverse and inclusive community?Weidman Powers:I think two main things. One is transparency and accountability around the numbers, what is being tried, whats working and what isnt. Were starting to see more companies come forward and say we have specific goals and targets, whether its a percent increase or companies are that putting a stake in the ground about what they want to look like and how they want to see their companies evolve. The more that companies can be specific and public about what theyre trying to do the more transparency and accountability will actually help move the needle. The other thing is culture change. Were starting to see companies recognize that just bringing in new people isnt the solution because if folks show up and they dont feel welcome or dont see a path for advancement, theyre going to bounce, so companies need to actually consciously think about not just who were getting in the door but what does our culture look like so that everyone has a chance of of success.MRD:While running CODE2040, have you experienced any racism or sexism?Weidman Powers:Yes. It shows up in different forms. Every now and then theres kind of a hateful tweet or blog post or comment. Never read the comments on the internet. But I think that sort of comes with the territory. Really what were trying to work against is the more subtle things that are hard to even pinpoint as racism or sexism. When we first started talking to several companies, we heard, were interested in your students but only if they went to an Ivy League school. Thats the kind of comment that isnt racist or sexist,  no, not on its face  but its certainly sending a message about what you believe is valuable and how an individual needs to conform in order to be seen as having worth in an environment. So there are subtle things like that that I think most of us wouldnt call racist today but that have huge racial implications.MRD:That got me thinking about the racial implications when people say you have to lower the bar in order to achieve diversity.Weidman Powers: Yeah, that may cross the threshold into being racist. The assumption is that youd be lowering the bar if you hired somebody who didnt conform to your current notion of talent. The people who say, I would love to hire more women or hire more people of color, but I dont want to lower the bar, the assumption implicit in there is a racist or sexist assumption.MRD:Going forward this year, how do you hope the conversation in diversity in tech will evolve?Weidman Powers:I hope that it evolves into a conversation that is inclusive of everybody that has influence. I think too often diversity is considered to be the realm of HR but really a lot of what needs to happen is a shift in culture, a shift in mindset and beliefs, and thats everybody. I think were already starting to hear theconversation move from diversity to inclusion, or to include inclusion, and I think thats important because frankly, were never going to succeed if its just black and brown people trying to make the change. We need everybody to buy into this and some of CODE2040smost visible and successful champions are white men. Theyre just as important to the mission as our students are. We have a very diverse team. We need to make sure everybodys is included if were going to actually create change.This is the last part of a five-part series.
