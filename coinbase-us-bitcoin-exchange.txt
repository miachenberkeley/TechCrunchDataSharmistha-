Fresh from scoring a massive $75 million funding round, bitcoin payment firm Coinbase has revealed that itwillopen the first regulatedbitcoin exchange in the U.S. on Monday.The company, which added theNew York Stock Exchange and USAA to its list of investors last week, told the Wall Street Journal that it has regulatory approval in half of all states, including significant areaslike New York and California. (TheNew York Department of Financial Services has been very vocal in its call for regulation via a proposed BitLicense.)Coinbase already offers exchange services in 19 countries overseas, and it said that its work accruing necessary licenses and approvals in the U.S. took five months. The company will only beable to offer services to customers that sign up in states were it is approved, but there are plans to gain approval in further states.Exchanges made via the Coinbase servicewill include a 0.25 percent commission fee that goes toCoinbase, although the companyis giving customers two months of free trades to get things going.The exact legality of bitcoin in the U.S. has been unclear for some time, so Coinbases news  and regulatory backing  is a significant mark in the sand.The busting of Silk Road, an underground market for illicit goods where bitcoins anonymity made it a popular payment option, has doubtless eased some early opinions that bitcoins modus operandi was financing nefarious activity, but theres still plenty of uncertainty about it as a digitalcurrency. The price of a single bitcoin dropped as low as $185 this month it is currently $263, but crossed $1,000 in 2013  and it is unclear whether it has reached relative stability.As for the Coinbase business itself, CEOBrian Armstrong is keen to explore the potential of bitcoin in emerging markets, and wants the company to expand its reach to at least 30 countries overall by the end of 2015.Coinbase had a huge year in 2014, and its achievements included landing several big name retail partners who began accepting bitcoin for the first time  including Overstock, Dell, Square, Mozilla and Wikipedia.PS: Did you know we just started a TechCrunch bitcoin podcast?
