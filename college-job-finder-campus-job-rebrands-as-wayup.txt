Campus Job, a startup that connects college students with local job opportunities, has changed its name toWayUp.Launchedin September of 2014 by recent grads Liz Wessel and JJ Fliegelman, WayUpprovides a platform for college students to find part-time work with companies looking for campus reps or other temporary employees. In April, the companyraised a $7.8 million Series A round led by General Catalyst.In less than a year, WayUp has signed upover 5,000 companiesandhundreds of thousands of student users, who attendsome 2,500 U.S. colleges.Founder Liz Wessel reports that one in three students who applied for a job through WayUp last semester got an offerfor at least one of the jobs. Thats a pretty compellingstat, speaking from semi-recent personalexperience with the frustratingpart-time college job hunt.Understandably, there was quite a bit of confusion with the Campus Job name. Aside from sounding to students like a tool for finding a job at the campus dining hall or library, the company was often called the wrong name entirely.In response, the founders hired a couple of students from the platform to come up with a better name, design a logo, and create a video announcing the new name.WayUp is completely free for students, who create a profile that includes their grades, prior work experience, and hobbies. Companies can create listings across multiple campuses for free, but theyre charged a fee per qualified applicant thatthey receive.
