New Yorkers, what are you doing tonight?Whatever it is, drop it and buy tickets to the New York TC Meetup. Weve got an amazing lineup for tonight, and well be at Output Williamsburg, which is where the cool kids hang out. Trust me.To start out the show, well be having a little fireside chat with Susan Lyne of BBG Ventures, and then well head straight into the pitch-off.If you love startups and even remotely enjoy high-pressure situations (experienced by others and not yourself), this is the event for you.Ten early-stage companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of expert VC judges. And John Biggs.After each pitch, the judges will grill the companies with a Q&A, and at the end of the pitch-off, the judges will determine a winner.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at Disrupt NY in May. Second place will get two tickets to the conference, and the Audience Choice winner will take home one ticket to the big show.Tickets are still available, and the event will be fun for people from all walks of life (as long as theyre 21+), so go ahead and buy a few tickets for your non-tech friends, too.You can buy tickets here.Oh, and as a special bonus, Ill be shooting the initial footage for a new TechCrunch Video series tonight at the event with folks who are in attendance. Be a star!Cant wait to see you tonight!
