Comixology recently launched Comixology Unlimited, a subscription plan that offers unlimited access to thousands of digital comics for just $5.99 per month.Given the all you can read model, its natural to compare the new service to Netflix, but CEO David Steinberger told me that Amazon Primes video offerings are a closer match  and no, not because of the corporate synergy (Amazon acquired Comixology two years ago), but because Comixology now combines subscription and individual purchase options.I also asked Steinberger about the absence of the two biggest comics publishers  DC and Marvel. He said hes certainly open to adding them in the future, and he also touted the fact that Comixology Unlimited is the only digital comics subscription that includes titles from publishers Dark Horse and Image.
