Layer,theformer TechCrunch Disrupt winnerthat makes it possible for developers to add rich messaging capabilities to their apps without having to build their own infrastructure, has been steadily growing since its debut back on the Disrupt stagetwo yeas ago. Today, the company reaches over 10,000 developers, including 200 paying customers who use its platform and tools to add features including messaging, voice and video into their applications without having to build these features from the ground-up.Today, Layer is expanding its product again, with the introduction of Layers webhooks service.The company explains via blog post that, while theLayer Platform API is used to input data into conversations, webhooks can serve as an output. As a developer, you define which events you want to be notified of and Layer will trigger a request to a URL you define, along with a JSON payload containing additional event information, the post states.For example, a dating app maker could use the new serviceto build a bot that prompted app users to chat by injecting conversation starters into their appsmessaging area, by monitoring for specific activity that would then trigger anautomated message to appear.Other developers could use new functionality to monitor for specific types of content, such as forspam filtering, profanity or content filtering, or it could look forkeywords and commands input by users. The servicecould also interoperate with external messaging systems like email or SMS  the latter which should prove useful for the growing number of companies launching app-less SMS-based concierge services that let users chat with virtual or human assistants over text messaging.Theadditional feature makes sense at a time when users are increasingly interacting with businesses by way of chat.Notes Layer co-founderand CEORon Palmeri, messaging is starting to replace email, telephone and other forms of interactions between companies and their customers, he says. And the type of things that get passed are not just text. Instead, businesses canuse messaging interfaces toshare information related to inventory or returns, take payment info from customers, remind users of upcoming events, and more.This ability to chatwith an apps end usersthrough a messaging interface also works asa new and more personal form of customer service. Companies that want to own their relationship with their customer dont want an intermediary, Palmeri adds. This is an incredibly rich way to interact with their customer, he says of Layers expanded capabilities.Since the companys debut in 2013 on TechCrunch Disrupts stage, a number of mobile app developers as well as those building for the web, have turned to Layer. The company reports 35 percent month-over-month growth in paying customers and a 50 percent increase in messaging volume growth. And in the past quarter, Layer has seen 450 percent message volume growth.In the past 30 days alone, Layer has seen 1,000 active developers building using its platform, and says that its support satisfaction rate (based on developers ratings support after a support session wraps) is over 90 percent.In addition, while 40 percent of Layers customers are U.S.-based, the remaining developers are from elsewhere around the world, including the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Africa.Among its customer base, Layer seesa variety of use cases. For example, inaddition to social apps like the sports communities Onefootball or Mitoo, other customers include San Francisco bus service Chariot; edtech companies likeUdacity and Indias PaGaLGuy; GoButler; Nordstrom-owned Trunk Club; Forbes and Tinders 30 Under 30 app; Barclays Bank; job apps like those from AngelList, Jobr, and Switch; Photobucket; dozens of dating apps like Hinge or Indias Woo; and others.Layers webhooks service will launch later this fall. In the meantime, developers can sign up for early access here.Meanwhile, Atlas, a user interface framework announced earlier this yearwhich offers source code that developers can customize to add iMessage-like messaging components to their apps, will be generally available toAndroid developers in a few weeks.
