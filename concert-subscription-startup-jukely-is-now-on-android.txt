Jukely, amonthly concert subscription service,says its breaking records (and not the vinyl kind.) Though it didnt want to say how many members are currently on the platform, founder Bora Celik did say it would soon be able to get a crowd to fill New Yorks Madison Square Garden (capacity for the concert venue is 18,200, for reference).That growth also means adding in new platforms like Android. Fans are finally able to book concerts on Jukely for Android starting today.The serviceis already on the web and iOS, but Android was something those onJukely had asked for some time.Jukely launched out of the Techstars NYC 2013 accelerator programasa sort of matchmaker for music lovers. Those into new and unique bands could go on the site and find those with similar tastes to go to concerts with.The Unlimited subscription service was introduced not long after. This plan lets music lovers choose an unlimited amount of concerts from local and indie bands in their city for $25 a month (or what youd normally spend on one small, unknown band and a beer).Unlimited proved to be popularamong users. People tell me they would not have gone to these concerts before, Celik told me over the phone from his New York office.Jukely also offers Members only shows with some of the bigger artists and to date the startup says it has partnered with more than 900 venues to bring experiences to its subscribers.Jukely is available in 15 cities across the U.S. as well as in London and Toronto.
