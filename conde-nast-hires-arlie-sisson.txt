Magazine publisher Cond Nast is hiring a new vice president to run its emerging products group  Arlie Sisson, whos joining from Starwood Hotels and Resorts.Sisson led Starwoods strategy for native apps on mobile, and before that, worked at mobile startupSilver Chalice New Media.Fred Santarpia, who became Conds chief digital officer last fall, told me that the emerging products group is itself a new creation. Conds various titles (including The New Yorker, Wired, and Vogue) have their own digital teams, but Santarpia suggested that theyre very much focused on running their day-to-day businesses.Sissons team, on the other hand, will be singularly focused on innovating for the companys future. For now, at least, that means experimenting with different kinds of mobile apps.Were looking at how fragmented the media landscape is, the many different platforms that our content can find a home on and many different form factors, Santarpia added. Who knows whats next? Maybe whats next is virtual reality  I dont know the answers, but I do know that really smart people at Cond Nast are thinking about the marketplace and how to position our brands.Sisson is scheduled to start work on May 4.The momentum and growth in the digital landscape is unlimited and connecting people to products is more important than ever before, she said in the hiring release. Joining the incredible talent at Cond Nast gives me the opportunity to work with its extraordinary brands to engage more audiences in more dynamic ways on more digital and mobile platforms.
