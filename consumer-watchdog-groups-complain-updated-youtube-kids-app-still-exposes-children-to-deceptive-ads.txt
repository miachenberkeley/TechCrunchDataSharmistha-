YouTube announced changes to its kid-friendly YouTube Kids mobile application this week designed to better educate parents on how the app works and the protections it offers, following a number of complaints, including those to the FTC, from consumer watchdog organizations. But the groups today are saying that YouTube hasnt gone far enough with the updated YouTube Kids app,calling the changessuperficial.Of particular concern, the organizations feel that the advertising that takes place inthe app is still excessive and deceptive in nature, and doesnt meet the same guidelines as the advertising permitted on childrens television programs.The issue the groups raise is one thats worth discussing, especially as mobile phones and tablet computers become the main screen of choice for todays children. A mobile technology study this year found that 36 percent of U.S. parents surveyed reported their children had interacted with smartphones or tablets before they turned one year old. Another 36 percent wereplaying mobile games by age two.Meanwhile, as is often the case with shifts in consumer adoption of new innovations, laws andregulations are slower to catch up with the reality of how technology is actually being used.That appears to be the case with something like YouTube Kids, which offers a curated selection of kid-friendly videos aimed at the pre-school to elementary school set organized into topical areas like Shows, Music, Learning and Explore.For children, using the app to browse video content is effectively taking the place of watching television. It even offers them shows in the form of web series, and other content from well-known kids entertainment brands likeDreamWorks TV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends, National Geographic Kids, Reading Rainbow, and Thomas the Tank Engine.However, thoughYouTube is becomingnew TV in a number of ways, the Kids app it isnt required to meet the same regulations that apply to the television industry. And groups like Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) take issue with that.ExplainsAngela Campbell, the attorney representing the two groups in their complaint to the FTC, Google is intentionally allowing advertisers to reach children aged 5 and under using the YouTube Kidsapp. Advertising to young children, who do not have the cognitive ability to distinguish between programming and advertising, is deceptive and unfair to children, she tells us.On childrens programs shown on broadcast television, cable or satellite TV, FCC regulations dont allow for the same type of advertising thats permitted today in the YouTube Kids app. For example, host selling is not permitted; program material has to be separated from commercials; plus,there are guidelinesthat set time limits around how often commercials are shown.But in YouTube Kids, YouTube Kids advertising policies  which prohibit the advertising of food, beverages and other products  now only apply to paid ads sold by Google. These paid ads are the labeled, 30- or 60-second videos that are shown before the childs selected video.However, notes Campbell, paid ads make up only a tiny fraction of the content available on YouTube Kids.This means that the vast majority of the content available on YouTube Kids is not subject to any limits on advertising, she says. .And as CCFC and CDD showed in their complaint to the FTC, [YouTube Kids] includes actual television commercials, company-produced promotional videos, and videos with host-selling and paid product placements.Forexample, if a child searches for cookie on the app, they may come across a TV commercial from a cookie company on a users channel on YouTube Kids. But because the video is on a users channel, Google would not consider this video a paid ad  so it wouldnt be subject to YouTubes Ads policies.Google, for what its worth, discloses this to parents by way of a new disclaimer added to the app store description:YouTube Kids contains paid ads in order to offer the app for free. Your child may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not Paid Ads. For more information, please check out our Parental Guide.(That guide is here.)In other words, the company is being transparent about itspolicy to some extent, but its sayingpaidadvertisingas a necessary evil in order to keep the app free. However,labeled, paid advertisementsthat are clearly separated from the shows and other videocontent aimed at kids cankeep the app free.So the disclaimer is a bit disingenuous as it doesnt reference how the creators own ads or paid endorsements are involved.For the watchdog groups, their end goal is to force kids videoapp makers, like Google,to follow the same guidelines that apply in thetelevision industry.This is not only because the apps themselves are becoming a real alternative to television programingas more kids adopt mobile technology, and more householdscut the cord with payTV providers, but also because app content can also be mirrored on the big screen  effectively becoming TV.In fact, the updated version of the YouTube Kids app now allows users to stream content to Chromecast, Apple TV, game consoles and smart TVs, says Google.The point is that, were YouTube Kids a broadcast, cable or satellite provider, the failure to separate commercial content from programming would be a clear violation of FCC rules, Josh Golin, the Executive Director at CCFC, points out. We believe it is ludicrous that Google shouldnt have to play by the rules just because YouTube Kids is an app. The fact that YouTube Kidsnow is designed to be shown over television sets just drives this point home even further, he says.As for the FTC complaint, the investigation is still underway and no timetable to a ruling has yet been offered.Update, 10/2/15, 2:25 PM ET: This article was updated to clarify the app store description references paid, not unlabeled, ads.
