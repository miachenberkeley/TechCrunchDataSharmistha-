Today at Disrupt NY,ContainerShip took the stage to showoff its technology built to help companies better deploy containerized applications to different hosting services. ContainerShip is part of a larger wave of containerization companies that want to make it simpler to place apps onto, for example, various cloud providers.In a phone call, the ContainerShip team stated that itsgoal as a company was to help others make [their] infrastructure portable.ContainerShip has an open-source focus, but with a commercial bent. Althoughthe companys core technology is open source, the startup will offer a paid product called ContainerShip Cloud, which will charge on a per-seat basis.Key to the ContainerShip pitch is portability. The company bets that developers wish that switching hosting providers wereeasier. However, the technical complexity of such a move can be difficult. To remedy that, ContainerShip takes all the work onto its own shoulders, so that developers can deploy their applications onto new cloud providers, or even onto new regions of their current provider.The company expects that its first customers will be small to medium-sized startups, but did note to TechCrunch that what it has built is also useful to larger, enterprise-scale companies.For now, itstech is free, with the companys founders indicatingthat, while they intend to charge eventually, immediate commercialization isnt agoal.If your eyes glaze over when Docker is brought up, I understand. But as worlds oflarger companies start to move off of legacy, on-premises tech, there is a large greenfield opportunity in the market. And, as Docker is hardly losing steam, ContainerShip might be in a good spot to sell some pickaxes.
