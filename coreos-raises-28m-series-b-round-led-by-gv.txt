CoreOS, the company behind the container-centric CoreOS Linux distribution and Tectonic container management service, today announced that it has raised a $28 million Series B round led by GV, the fund formerly known as Google Ventures.Other investors includeAccel, Fuel Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) and the Y Combinator Continuity Fund. In total, the company has now raised$48 million.As CoreOS co-founder and CEO Alex Polvi told me, this new round will provide more fuel for the tank. He noted that the company had a lot of inbound interest in this round, but the decision to work with GV was a pretty easy one, it seems. GV already led CoreOSs add-on to its Series A round, after all, and Polvi describes the whole process as quick and easy (which isnt something you typically hear about Series B rounds these days).Given that the company sees its mission as bringing Googles infrastructure to everyone else, or GIFEE as Polvi likes to call it whenever he gets a chance, working closely with Google also makes a lot of sense.As part of this round, GV General Partner Dave Munichiello will take a seat on CoreOSs board, too.The last couple of years were about making GIFEE possible  now its about how we package that and not just make open source users happy with it but also businesses that just want solutions, Polvi said. We want to make this way of running infrastructure ubiquitous.The core of CoreOSs product range, of course, is the CoreOS distribution, but the Kubernetes-based Tectonic container management platform is what brings all of these efforts together.Tectonic is the full platform, Polvi said. What youll see is that well continue to refine that but also build more products that run on the platform. He likens this process to how cloud providers like Amazons AWS first launched their core compute, storage and networking services and then built other products on top of that.
