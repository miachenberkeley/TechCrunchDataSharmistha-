Microsofts Cortana quietly snuckonto Android in a meaningful this week in a small but telling move that you probably missed unless you happen to own aOnePlus One smartphone.Thats because Cyanogenrolled out a new version of its alternative Android operative system which featuresCortana baked into the software. The movehad been promised last year but this upgrade is initially only available for OnePlus One device owners in the U.S..So, whats the big deal here?The move looks like the first collaboration between Cyanogen, which has aggressively forked Android intoa very different type of mobile software, and Microsoft, which investedwas falsely reported to have invested in the startup last year and has a new focus on enabling its software and services across multiple platforms.By integrating Cortana into the core of Cyanogen, the company said it is opening the door to future capabilities that dont currently exist.Cortana in Cyanogen sounds a lot like Siri within iOS:Once awake, from setting reminders and scheduling meetings, to calling and texting friends, Cortana helps you do more with hands-free multitasking. Whether youre glancing at your lock screen or immersed in an app or game, Cortana is at attention as soon as you say Hey Cortana. Immediately she will go to task.Uncannily similar, indeed (it alsoincludes the Hey Cortana feature that was killed off from inside Cortana for Android.)But, while Siri works best with Apple apps and services, the Cortana integration promises tobe deeper.When Apple launched Apple Music at WWDC, they showed the Siri integration with Apple Music. Siri doesnt power Spotify like that so we can do these kind of things with for example, integration of Microsofts Cortana into the OS enabling natural language to power Spotify and other services, Cyanogen CEO Kirk McMaster saidin an interview with International Business Times last year.It isnt clear when this feature will roll out to other Cyanogen-compatible devices, but already this ambitious startup is getting serious withits quest to steal Android away from Google.
