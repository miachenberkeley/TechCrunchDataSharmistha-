Satoshi Nakamoto, 2016 edition, might not be Craig Wright after all. Just a couple of days after claiming that he was the creator of bitcoin, the Australian entrepreneur updated his website with a note that says that he wont share the proof that hes Satoshi Nakamoto.And Wright has been smart. He talked with journalists working for GQ, the BBC and The Economist, telling them he is Satoshi. Some of them were more skeptical than others. But a good old embargo that left crypto experts in the unknown was the best strategy. These headlines looked so great!It didnt take long before evidence against Wrights claim piled up. None of what Wright said showed that he was Satoshi.Everybody was asking for some irrefutable proof. And the good thing is that theres an easy one. We already know one of Satoshis address. If someone can send bitcoins from this address, then its Satoshi.But Wright doesnt want to do it now. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke, he wrote. I do not have the courage. I cannot.As you can see, Wright doesnt take back his claim that hes Satoshi. He just says that he doesnt want to prove it. But lets be honest, this sounds a lot like Wright isnt Satoshi.This story got quite ugly when Wright shared proofs in private with Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis. These two influential members of the Bitcoin Foundation then publicly supported Wrights theory.So lets give Wright a round of applause. Its pretty impressive that he got to pretend that he was Satoshi Nakamoto for a few hours.Too bad we didnt get a car chase across Los Angeles like in 2014  that was a fun Satoshi. After a dozen of different Satoshi theories, I think its fair to say that the next time you see a feature story on The Real Satoshi, chances are its not Satoshi.And goodbye.
