Crate, the winner of our TechCrunch Disrupt Europestartup Battlefield in 2014, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed round for its open-source SQL database technology.The round was led by London-basedDawn Capital, which was joined by existing investors Sunstone Capital, DFJ Esprit and Speedinvest. In addition to these, Docker creator and CTO Solomon Hykes also participated in this round.Crates simplicity and masterless architecture make it a perfect match for containerized environments,Hykessaid in todays announcement. I expect to see it widely deployed as more developers adopt the new microservices paradigm.As Crate CEO and co-founder Christian Lutz told me, the company plans to use this additional funding to expand its presence in Silicon Valley.While Crates core engineering group will remain in Europe, the company plans to position more pre-sales engineers and other staff in the U.S. to help its growing customer base there.Lutz says that Crate plans to raise a Series A round later this year and this new round will allow it to build thebasis for that.Looking ahead, Lutz tells me that the company plans to soon launch its first enterprise products, including support for data centerreplication, outside of Crates open source core.
