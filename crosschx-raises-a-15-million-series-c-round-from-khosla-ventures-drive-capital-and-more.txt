Healthcare identity startup CrossChx announced this morning that they raised a $15 million Series C financing round from Khosla Ventures, Drive Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, NCT Ventures and Moonshots Capital.This brings their total funding to $35 million since being founded in 2012.The Columbus, OH startups primary product is a healthcare identity management system forpatients called Queue. Queueand its accompanying tablet-based kiosk system allows patients to store their basic information like name, address, medical allergies, family historyall the things you have to re-enter every time you visit a new healthcare facilityinto a portable, secure cloud profile.This stored profileis then easily and securely transferable to the front desk of any healthcare provider that uses it and can speed up wait times for patients. Healthcare providers can also use Queueto manage patient arrivals internally. Its a SaaS implementation and is already being used in 1,000locations and is managing 50 million patient profiles.I spoke with co-founder and CEO Sean Lane about Queue and inquired about whether patients will feel safe storing part of their healthcare profile in the cloud. The ex-airforce, ex-NSA software security expert assured me that the company goes above and beyond HIPAA requirementsmore than double the HIPAA security requirements according to Lane.He went on to explain that one of their main missions is to prevent duplicative patient profiles from existingin multiple systems or on paper in multiple healthcare offices like it does today. In his words, offices access this info, only when they need it and are not burdened with storing this information themselves. This system can also identify and prevent errors, as weve previously reported.CrossChxplan to use the additional financing to increase their current staff of 120, extendtheir current tablet-based product distribution and also launch a new smartphone-based platform for patients.
