Happy Friday, everyone. Were glad that you are with us today before we take offand drink beer celebrate America.Our own Sarah Buhr took over the hosting slot this week, while Matthew Lynley and myself helped out. We dug into the release of Apple Music, Ubers decision to absorb a large chunk of Microsofts Bing Maps team, and how Shyp, a startup, is helping shape the discussion of labor in Silicon Valley.Its a beautiful day here in San Francisco, so if you are local to our office, get yourself to a park and hit the snooze button. Well see you all in a week.
