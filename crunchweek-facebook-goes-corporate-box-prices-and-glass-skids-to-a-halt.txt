Its Friday and that means Crunchweek. This week Colleen Taylor, Kyle Russell and myself sat around the Small White Table to discuss Facebooks new corporate communication product, Boxs IPO priceand Googles big changes to its Glass hardware program.You can still buy Glass for another few days and Box might re-price its offering, but this is where the week ended. Pour a coffee and have a watch; well be back next Friday with all the latest.
