This time around, Sarah Buhr and I were joined by John Biggs, who is in town visiting from New York City to attend the TechCrunch 10th Anniversary party tomorrow. We talked about Facebooks new Lite app aimed at mobile phone users in the developing world, Pinterests highly anticipated launch of shoppable Pins, and some cool new research that could let you log into devices and accounts using only your brain.
