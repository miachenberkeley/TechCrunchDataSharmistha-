Hello internet aliens, and welcome to another episode of CrunchWeek, TechCrunchs weekly roundup show where we talk the biggest things in tech. As you can tell from the show, we spent the entire week in a warehouse talking about disruption, but have no fear, weve had our eyes and ears open about what happened this week.The iPhone 6S and 6S plus made their debuts, Watch OS2 finally sees the light of day (and it works!), Pebble has a new circular watch and Instagram is huge. And is getting huger.As Alex says: Its Friday, its CrunchWeek, its time to throw down and talk some smack. Have a weekend to watch some fantastic video and interesting talks? Then mosey on over and consume what you missed at TechCrunch Disrupt. Were biased, but it really was awesome.
