Hello from New York, friends, where TechCrunchs staff has taken up residence to put on a small confab that you might have heard of. This week, the lovely Anthony Ha, the brilliant Colleen Taylor and myself are on hand, and on foot, to dig our way through the week.This time around, Microsoft managed to go viral by promising to guess your age, Twitter and LinkedIn hit the skids after reporting earnings, and Secrets very public death. Were in a hotel, without chairs, so consider this to be a CrunchWeek-On-The-Go.More soon, and see you all in a few days at Disrupt.
