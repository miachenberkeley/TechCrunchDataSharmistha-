Hello my friend, and welcome back to another episode of CrunchWeek. Were glad that you are with us today.This time round the round white table red chairs Drew Olanoff, Sarah Lane, and your humble servant discussed three of the weeks largest stories: The massive spike in technology earnings, Reddits never-ending issues regarding content and Internet trolling, and, of course, the current carnage among some of Uber For X startups.All that and a bit of #personalnews. Next week,a new TechCrunch show called Bullish is launching, and Im the host. It will debut on Wednesday at 10 am Eastern, and 7 am Pacific. So set your DVR browser to TechCrunch dot com, and you will see me in a tie. I promise it wont be too scary.For now, sit back, take the cork out of that barrel aged cocktail you have been sitting on since the farm-to-table, vegan farmers market and hit play. Lets get silly.
