Welcome back to another episode of CrunchWeek. Were very glad that you are here.This time round, our fearless Matthew Lynley headed the ship, while our own Josh Constine and your humble servant were on hand to help out along the way.We dug into the very turbulent global markets, and what that means for technology shares, along with a dive into the latest from Facebook, and, of course, that little news about a video portal that you might have heard of, YouTube.We had fun this week, and we hope that you have a laugh or two as well. Crack something cold, hang with us, and we will see you all in a short seven days.
