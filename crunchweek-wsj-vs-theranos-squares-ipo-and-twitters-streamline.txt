Knock. Knock.Whos there?CrunchWeek!OK, fineit wasnt funny.Welcome to another episode of CrunchWeek, TechCrunchs weekly roundup show where we talk the biggest things in tech.This week were chatting about Theranos impending battle with the FDA, Square going for the IPO, Twitter laying off some staff and Ballmer becomes a fan (but not of my impersonation of him). Also, Megan decided she was too cool to wear a blazer. Pshhh.As the Microsoft-SurfaceBook-Loving-Ballmer-Fan-Club-Founding Alex says: Its Friday, its CrunchWeek, its time to throw down and talk some smack. Hit play, and well see you all right back here in 7 days.
