Another week has left us in a miasma of earnings, product releases, and something called the Apple Watch. As such, its the perfect time to sit around our little round table we keep in the back of TechCrunch, and kick over the most important stories of the week: Amazons massively popular quarter, Zenefits massive capital raise, and, yes, the Apple Watch.This time around, Colleen Taylor guided our little boat, while Kyle Russell and your humble servant were on hand to provide color commentary.Sit down, pop a tab, put your feet up, and lets get into this weekend right.
