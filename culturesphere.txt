While businesseshave plenty of options if they want to push their employees to do more social media sharing, CultureSphere founder and CEO Danny Gordon said the existing tools all take a similar top down approach  senior marketing and social media executives decide whats worth sharing, then everyone else just shares it, or doesnt.Gordon saidCultureSphere, on the other hand, is the first social media platform thats 100 percent inspired by employees.CultureSphere launched at the end of last month, and today its announcing the members of its advisory board: former Kodak CMO Jeffrey Hayzlett, Brocade CMO Christine Heckart, CMO Council founder Donovan Neale-May, consultant and author of The Social Employee Cheryl Burgessand former Mitel CMO Martyn Etherington.Heres how the (currently free) productworks: Employees upload their own photos and videos into the companys feed in the iOS app. Company-designated curators then go through the content and unlock anything they think is appropriate for broader sharing. Once its unlocked, any employee using the app can share it more broadly. Employees can also upload content thats only meant for sharing within the company,upvote the photos and videos they think arebest and can compete for the top spot on company leaderboards.Were really marrying all three generations in corporate America, Gordon added, arguing that this allows older executives to tap into their younger employees creativity and social media savvy. He recalled one early customer telling him, Wow, I had no idea all this amazing stuff happens in my company.
