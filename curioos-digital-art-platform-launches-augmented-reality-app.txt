In a world where we can order almost anything online, finding wall art for the home can actually be an overwhelming process online. There are just so many options, from traditional retailers to Art.com to sites that let you print out your Instagrams. But when it comes to digital art, there really hasnt been a single marketplace for artists and buyers to put everything in one place.Curioos aims to change that.The site is a marketplace that allows digital artists to post their work, print them on a variety of materials, and distribute those pieces through the site. The service launched all the way back in 2012 after founder and CEO Matt Valoatto saw success in aggregating digital artwork on to a Tumblr. Starting from that network, hes grown Curioos to over 3,000 pieces of artwork and more than 500 curated artists.This week, Curioos also launched an augmented reality app letting you see everything in the catalog as it would look on your own wall. Anyone with access to a printer can play. You simply print out a bar code, download the app, and tape the bar code to the wall. You can then use the app to see what the art would look like on your walls through the phones camera.Curioos offers artists the chance to print their work on Aluminum, acrylic glass, and canvas, and in plenty of sizes so that the customer has options. Artists can decides which materials fit their pieces best, and receive a commission for each piece sold.To learn more about Curioos, check out the website here.
