Keen IO announced today that its open-sourcing one of its key features.The company allows customers to create their own analytics tools without having to develop the infrastructure from scratch. As youd probably guess, its a fairly developer-centric product. The last time I spoke to co-founder and CEO Kyle Wild, he told me, Our customers get to write code, so they dont have to solve the problem our way.But the Data Explorer, which launched earlier this year, isnt just for programmers. Instead, businesses can use it to explore and visualize their data through a friendlier interface. In Wilds words, it lets you point-and-click your way to analyze data.By open-sourcing the tool, Wild said Keen IO is allowing customers to embed the interface into their own internal websites and apps, customize the interface and potentially improve it and contribute back.Wild noted that Keen IO already open-sourced its dashboard templatesand he said the company plans to make more available in the future.For us, this is definitely not a one-off thing, he said. Open source is a huge part of our approach  really, any company that wants to be legitimate with developers should probably do that.You can learn more here.
