As brick-and-mortar commerce continues to shift online  whether thats to competitors like Amazon, through online ordering systems or into instant delivery apps  traditional retailers are looking for new ways to accommodate a customer base that now wants the increased convenience that comes with not having to park their cars, then wander around the store, cart in hand. Case in point: Today CVS announced an investment in Palo Alto-based shopping startup Curbside, along with plans to further roll out to CVSs9,600 retail pharmacy locations curbside pickups powered by the service.Details of the investment were not disclosed, but its being described by the companies as a strategic partnership that will allow the two to work more closely together on expansions of the technology to other areas of CVSs business, including its pharmacies and MinuteClinics.CVS is also introducing its new curbside pickup option as a branded experience called CVS Express, which will be accessible within its own CVS mobile application. This is currently available in 350 locations in San Francisco, Charlotte, NC, and Atlanta, GA, allowing customers to select from close to 10,000 SKUs  or about three-quarters of CVSs inventory, save for some locally distributed items.The investment and launch of CVS Express follows what were before pilot tests with the startup in the San Francisco Bay Area, beginning last summer. In October, CVS decided to launch a co-branded experience with Curbside. And based on those trials, CVS opted to deepen its relationship with the startup.Whilethe retailer isnt talking about how many of its customers have used the service to date, or what impact it has had on sales, it does see the promise and potential in the convenience mobileordering and store pickup provides.To use the service  which is also available from Curbsides own mobile application  customers can place items in their basket while shopping from their smartphone, then head over to their local retail location where the order is ready for pickup within an hour.Theres no additional fee for using this option, whichbenefits a range of customers, from busy professionals to moms with babies or small kids they dont want to have to wrangle in the stores or even the mobility-impaired.Orders are sent to CVS staff inside the stores when placed through Curbsides mobile software running on a company-owned mobile device, and store employees then pick the items and fill customersbags. When theyve finished, they mark the order as ready in the app, which alerts the user. And whenthe customerarrives, Curbsides geo-location technology again alerts the staff who will bring the order out to the car.Today, many of the top sellers are things like diapers and other baby items, or everyday necessities like milk.CVS says it hasnt had to increase headcount to accommodate mobile orders at this time  its just repurposing existing store staff.In addition, whatimpressed CVS the most and encouraged its investment was that it saw customers returning to use thispickup service multiple times.The thing that got us so excited about our initial pilots over the last summer  and that has continued  is that we see that over two-thirds of our customers who try it actually repeat usage of it in a very short period of time, says Brian Tilzer, Chief Digital Officer at CVS Health. Customers like it a lot.Though CVS wont talk about its repeat usage numbers, the Curbside app itself has seen repeat usage of 55 percent among a largely female customer base (65 percent). This is to some extent influenced by its work with retailers like Target.Curbside today has relationships with other retailers, including Target (100 locations), Sephora, and Levis, and some Bay Area malls  in totalreachingmore than 500 stores across the U.S. However, CVS is the first to integrate Curbsidessoftware into itsown mobile application.This integration was made possible throughhelp from CVSs digital innovation lab in Boston, which allowed themto bring the technology to market in a matter of months.For a traditional retailer, being able to adjust to the changes in the e-commerce landscape is a must, Tilzer explains.Moving at digital speed and innovating sort of like Silicon Valley companies innovate is a critical priority of ours at CVS, he says. The technology capabilities and the expertise that [Curbside CEO Jaron Waldman] and his team have are going to allow us to invent things that dont exist in the name of a better pharmacy and healthcare experience.The investment aligns our interests on this and allows us to collaborate more deeply, he adds.Curbside generates revenue through a SaaS model  meaning CVS pays a metered rate based on transaction volume when orders come in through the CVS app.Meanwhile, Curbside app orders work on more of an affiliate model.To date, Curbside hadraised $34.5 million prior to the CVS investment.The CVS Express branded experience is now live in select markets, withfurther rollout planned for this year.
