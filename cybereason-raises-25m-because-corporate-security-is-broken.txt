As data breaches exposemillions of U.S. health recordsand cyber attacksthreaten to cause anaccidental nuclear war, security tech is more relevant than ever.Cybereason, an Israeli startup that provides real-time cyber attack detection and response tech for the enterprise, is the latest companyto tap into the heightened fear around security breaches. Theyve just closed$25 million in Series B funding led by Spark Capital with participation from strategic investor Lockheed Martin and currentbackerCRV.Cybereason has built a cyber defense productfor business people, not just security experts. With a team made upof just as manydesigners and communications experts as engineering and security professionals, their primary concern is creating a product that businesses can understand.If youve ever seen a security product, its always gobbedly-gook and you never really know whats going on  but these guys are different, they give you a really amazing graphical interface that is like a consumer product, says Santo Politi of Spark Capital, who is joining the Cybereason board.Behindthe streamlined dashboardis a big data-drivenenginethat pulls inall of an organizations daily operations and relationships.Byprocessing and analyzing that data in real-time, Cybereason is able to build a holistic user profile andflag any unusualactivity for investigation.If the system determines that a company is being attacked, Cybereason provides the userwith a comprehensivesummaryof the breach: the root cause, the timeline, who is involved, what tools they are using, and what kind of informationis being transmittedin and out of the organization  the five pillars, according to founder Lior Div.Prior to founding Cybereason, Div spent six years serving in the Israeli armys8200 Unit,the elite security division thats comparable to our NSA. He then worked asa private contractor for the government where he specialized inreverse engineeringhacking operations.Our assumption is that companies cannot recruit the right people to do this job, and even when they can, it doesnt scale, says Div.The amount of information and cross-correlation that they need to do in real-time to understand if theyre under attack is impossible, he says.The scary part is that companies often dont realize theyve been hacked until the damage has been done.Div says that duringone of his early product demosfor a private defense contractor, Cybereason identified a full-blown attack by the Chinese  ten thousand usernames and passwords were leaked, and the attackers had access to nearly half of the organization on a daily basis.The securitybreachwas too sensitive to be shared with the press, but Div saysthat the FBI was involved and that the company had no indication thatthey were being hacked until Cybereason detected it.The unnamed contractor is now one of the roughly 20 organizations across the defense, finance, manufacturing, and pharma industries that Cybereason has signed up since launching out of stealth in February of last year. With the boost in funding, the companywill invest heavily in sales and marketing as well as continued R&D.
