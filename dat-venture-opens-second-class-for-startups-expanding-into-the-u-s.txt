For peoplewho didnt grow up in the U.S., navigating the Americanstartup scene can be intimidating. Dat Venture, a Boston-based accelerator for international entrepreneurs, wants to change this.Dat, which is kicking off its second cohort today, hasrefashionedthetraditional accelerator model into a program designed tolower the barriers forinternational entrepreneurslooking to bring their businesses tothe U.S.The new batch of 16 startups includes aSpanish augmented reality company, aFrench biochemistry company, andClean Tech companies out of Spain and Colombia.Instead of providingseed funding in exchange for equity, Dat Venture asks companies to pay their own way. In exchange, they arrangehousing at shared living space Krash andoffice spaceat WeWork, and helpfoundersbuildrelationships and expandtheir American customer base.These are not idea-stage companies  theyre much later-stage than the typical MassChallenge or Techstars company, says Matt Hurley, co-founder of Dat Venture, who was previously at Techstars in Boston.Theyre just entering the growth stage of their company  70% are revenue-generating, and 75% have already raised one round of funding, Hurley says.Hurleys co-founder Tomas Ratia moved to Boston from Spain seven years ago, so hesfamiliar withthe difficulties of breaking into the startup scene as a foreigner. Neither Hurley or Ratia have substantialexperience in venture investing, but they seem to be well-connected in Bostons tech scene.The pilot program, which wrapped up in April, accepted 14 Spanish startups, eight of which are now generating a combined $10 million in revenue. Hurley says about half entered the program to raise funding from U.S.-based VCs, and the other half wanted to validate their product in the U.S. market before returning to fundraise in Europe.UptoDown, one of the pilot companies, is the second largest Android app catalogue in the world (behind Google Play) with a large user base in Latin America and Europe. They increased their U.S.customer basefrom 20% to 50% of their total users, saw their Alexa ranking jump to 375, and theyre nearing 100 million visits per month. Since advertisers pay exponentially more for American pageviews, UptoDown was able to grow its revenue substantially as a result.Often times its simple  many international companies dont know how to get past the logistical obstacles that prevent them from coming here, and were able to lower that barrier a little bit, says Matt Hurley, founder of Dat Venture.Vortex Bladeless, a startup that builds bladeless wind turbines, had 7 patents in Spain before participating in the pilot program but wanted to raise a large venture round and scale in the U.S. Dat helped the foundersestablish a legal entity in Massachusetts and form an advisory board with Ideo, Harvard, and Sun Edison. Vortexs crowdfunding campaign launched on Indiegogo three days ago and theyve already surpassed their goal of $50k (from over 900 contributors) within a week.Hurley says hes in the process of raising a $20 million fund for follow-on investing, which he hopes to closeinthe next eight months.
