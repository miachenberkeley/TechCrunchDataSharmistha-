David Lee, a former Google executive who for several years ran the seed-stage venture fund SV Angel, is back with his ownnew firm, shows an SEC filing. The outfit is called Refactor Capital and its apparently targeting $50 million for its debut fund.Refactor, which was incorporated seven months ago, doesnt appear to have a site up and running yet. But the SEC filing lists as Lees cofounders Zal Bilimoria and Rick Barber.Bilimoria has spent the last 2.5 years as a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where, according to his LinkedIn profile, he co-led the firms investments in Cyanogen, Teespring, Omada Health, ToutApp, Altschool, Lyft, Product Hunt, Honor, HumanAPI, Mixpanel, SolveBio, uBiome, andZenefits, among others.Bilimoria says on LinkedIn that he also recently helped get Andreessen Horowitzs new $200 million Bio Fund off the ground.He looks to be leaving just as Andreessen Horowitznears a close onits fifth multi-stageventurefund, which sources have told us will be at least $1.5 billion in size. (Thatswhere the firm capped its fourth fund two years ago.)Rick Barber, who also worked briefly at Andreessen Horowitz  hewas a data scientist on staff in 2013 most recently served asthe chief of staff at Nuna, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based health care analytics company.Reached at his L.A. home, Lee declined to comment about the fund, citing SEC regulations.Seemingly, the firm is an extension of the angel bets that Leehas been making since leaving SV Angel, which is itself raising a fresh $46 million and with which Lee somewhat abruptly parted ways in May of last year. (Firm cofounder Ron Conway said at the time that Lee had made a personal decision to spend more time with his wife, children, and extended family in Los Angeles.)Among his numerous personalbets over the last year, Lee has backedFitzroy Toys, a new, L.A.-based online marketplace connecting indie toymakers with retailers.He has also seemingly spent a lot of time looking at health care-related startups, with other investments in Notable Labs, ayear-old, San Francisco-basedpersonalized drug combination testing service for cancer patients; CoFactor Genomics, an eight-year-old, St. Louis, Mo.-based company thats building disease diagnostics using RNA (as opposed to DNA); and Call9, a year-old, Palo Alto-based telemedicine startup that calls doctors on demand. (We profiled the company herein January when it closed on $10 million in Series A funding.)Indeed, sources familiar with Refactors plans say the firm plans to spend much of its time on the intersection of healthcare and software.It isnt surprising. Lee, a cancer survivor, had talked about his interest in healthcare informaticsbeginning in 2013.News of Refactors new fund was first reported in Term Sheet.
