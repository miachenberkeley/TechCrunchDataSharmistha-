Design startup Decorist has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from home improve giant Lowes Companies, the Womens Venture Capital Fund and undisclosed angel investors.The big player in the marketis probably Houzz, which allows users to find home design ideas and hire architects, designers and others who can actually make those ideas a reality. The Decorist approach is a bit different  its an online platform where users can connect with designers for advice.CEO Gretchen Hansen (pictured above) said she was inspired to start the company after her own experience buying these two amazing chairs for her office and discovering that she absolutely hated the way they looked once they were in the room. She asked a designer friend for help, who was able to look at photos and design a much better office.With Decorist, Hansen said shes trying to replicate that virtual design experience:People want beautiful homes, but they dont have that help, that component of assisted commerce.The first thing users are asked to do on Decorist is create their ideal living room, which in turn allows the companyto buildan online profile of their taste  for example, the site suggested that I have eclectic taste, preferring to mix and match different styles. (That might be a nice way of suggesting that my choices didnt really fit together  ) Then you can connect to professional designers through the Ask a Designer feature, or through full room makeovers, which start at $199.Hansen said Decorist isnt just matching designers and customers  it also uses that style profile to suggest items that would be a good fit. In other words, its a combination of personalized, technology-powered recommendations with the filter of a professional designer.And of course you can actually make purchases based on those recommendations.The site launched last year, and Hansen said the average customer shopping cart is now an impressive $3,000. She added that she doesnt just want to be a one-off makeover provider, but rather create a relationship with consumers, so they come back anytime they have design-related needs.As the firms name suggests, its focused on backing women entrepreneurs. In this case,Dodi said its also nice to invest in a company thats reaching primarily female consumers.Were really happy that we can actually to talk a B2C platform and not just these dry enterprise-focused companies, she said. They have huge potential, but theyre not as sexy.
