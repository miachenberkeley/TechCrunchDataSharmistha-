If its your birthday, Mothers Day or some other significant occasion, its likely youll receive a barrage of text messages, emails and calls. Even if its not a special day, between your friends, significant other and boss, theres probably a fair amount of action on your phone.Deep Focus summarizes who has contacted you and lets you know how important that information is based on the emotions it has identified in the email, voicemail, text message, Facebook message, etc. From there, Deep Focus marks the message as either important or not important.Its hard to know whats important and whats not, Jeff Rothkirch, a member of the Deep Focus team, told me. Thats why he and Quan Zhou tapped into Twilios messaging API to serve as a middle-person and IBM Watsons API to determine what you should be notified about.The app works in real time, and you can see how it works by texting470-823-7643. I sent Jeff a couple of texts to seehow well it really worked. When I texted, I am so angry with you, Deep Focus marked the message as important. When I texted, Ahhhhhh heheh, Deep Focus marked it as not important. Makes sense! The emotion indicator was also spot-on, recognizing that my important message included a fair amount of anger and my unimportant message had some fear in it.Rothkirch and Zhou arent totally sure theyll make it available to the public, but my fingers are crossed that they do.Check out the presentation below.
