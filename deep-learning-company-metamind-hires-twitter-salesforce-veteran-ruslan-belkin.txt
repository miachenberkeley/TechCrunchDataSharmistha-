Ruslan adds to our powerhouse team that already includes my co-founder Sven Strohband along with several Stanford PhDs with machine learning experience.Last fall at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, Vinod Khosla predicted machine learning will have more impact than mobile in the next 20 years. Today he praised Belkins addition to the MetaMind team.We are excited to add the deep expertise of a hypergrowth veteran like Ruslan to MetaMind, Khosla said.
