Music streaming service Deezer has opened its HD-quality offeringup to all, following an initial launch in the U.S.which includeda period of exclusivity with Sonos.Deezer Elite, as the service is called, costs$14.99 per month, as opposed to the companysregular subscription which is$9.99 per month, or 14.99 per month in the UK. Elite is discounted to9.99 per for one/two year packages, while existing Deezer Premium userscan upgrade for $40, or for free if they are also Sonos customers. For thoseprices, they gain access to Deezers 35 million track library asFLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files at standard of 1,411 kbps or higher.That, the France-headquartered firm, said is five time higher than regular services. Deezer Elite users can alsostream music to connected devices, although thats become a standard feature for most paid-for subscriptions.Deezer is by no means the first to venture into higher quality audio services. Pono, which isfronted by musician Neil Young, is one proponent of that approach, while Swedens Aspiro  a company that was recently bought by rapper Jay-Z  offers similar high-def optionsin the form of its WiMP and Tidal services.It isnt clear what Jay-Zs plans for the company are youd expect he is motivatedby the success of Dr. Dres Beats venture,acquired by Apple for $3billion last year  but recent figuresput Aspiros userbase at 503,000, less than 50,000 of whom are on its premium service. It is early days, but its fair to say that no single company has shown traction with a HD offering  indeed, neither Spotify nor Rdio even offer one at this point, although the latter did recently upgrade its playback quality.Deezer maintainsa lower profile than the likes of Spotify or Rdio, but it nonetheless claims 16 million monthly users. Of that number, it says6 million are paying customers.
