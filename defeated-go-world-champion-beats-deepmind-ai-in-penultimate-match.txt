Machines 3, humans 1 Thats the current score in a five-match series being played out between DeepMinds AlphaGo and human Go world champion,Lee Sedol.Last week the Google-owned AI chalked up a landmark victory by winning the opening bout with Sedol  the first time a machine had outplayed a world class professional Go player. The algorithmthen went on to cement victory in the five-match series by winning both the next two games, to takea consecutive three-game streak.However as the final two matches are played out,Sedol has clawed one back for humansby winning the fourth match (via The Verge), and chalking up his first win against the AI.DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis tweeted that the machines loss was due to Sedols ingenuity in move 78 pressurizing it into making a fatal mistakeLee Sedol wins game 4!!! Congratulations! He was too good for us today and pressured #AlphaGo into a mistake that it couldnt recover from Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) March 13, 2016Lee Sedols brilliant moves deliver a comeback against #AlphaGo in game 4  https://t.co/MbtYm64lhL pic.twitter.com/NchPMDZTU6 Google (@google) March 13, 2016AlphaGo combines two artificial intelligence techniques in its questtry master the hugely complex game ofGo, applying deep learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search  allowing the AIto simulate millions of games, gleanthe outcomes and learn from those to generalize a (evidently highly successful but not unbeatable) Go game strategy.Discussing the complexity of the challenge ahead of AlphaGoearlier this year, Googlenoted in anblog post: There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions [in the game of Go]  thats more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess.Although AlphaGos triumph against Sedol, a professional Go player whois ranked second in the world, is undoubtedly impressive, the artificial intelligenceisstill very much a narrow AI  in the sense that it has been designed for one veryspecific task,as with otherAIs built to master other games like chess and Jeopardy!The holy grail of artificial intelligence remains the creation of a general learning AI that can apply multifaceted intelligence to solve problems of all stripes. And machines are clearly very far away frombeing able to claim victory in the chaotic complexity of theoff-boardgame world, as Hassabis himself concedes.The numberof variables involved in even apparently simple human tasks  like tidying a room  quickly makeseven the mostsophisticated machine intelligence look dumb. So us humans shouldnt feel too bad about losing at GoYou can follow the final match inthe AlphaGo series, due to take place on March 15,live via YouTube here.
