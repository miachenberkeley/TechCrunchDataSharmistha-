It was only in July that Deliveroo raised $70 million in Series C funding, but today the London-headquartered company has announced that its been dining at the VC table again.This brings Deliveroos total funding to approximately $200 million since being founded in 2012. The company isnt revealing the valuation put on it by investors and CEO and founder Will Shu wouldnt be drawn on the issue (see below).The company is also announcing that it has expanded beyond Europe to Asia, Australia and the Middle East, namely the cities of Hong Kong, Singapore, Melbourne, Sydney and Dubai.That means that Deliveroo is now active in a whopping 50 cities across 12 countries, while the new investment will be used for further international expansion with the aim to establish the startup as the number one provider of on-demand high-quality food delivery. Over 5,000 restaurants currently offer delivery via Deliveroo worldwide.In a hastily-arranged call, I discussed all of the above and more with the companys founder, including how Deliveroo sits in an increasingly crowded on-demand delivery space  Rocket Internet (GFC)-backed Take Eat Easy is a direct competitor  what it plans to spend the additional capital on, and why the startup still doesnt deliver to my part of inner London.Listen to the lightly edited interview with Will Shu below.
