Are we headed for yet moreprice wars in the worldof cloud computing? Amazon and Google have made huge inroads into the market on the back of deep discounts and generous storage allowances, and as a measureof theircompetitive threat,today one of the bigger and older incumbents out of Europe announced a partnershipthat it hopes will help it fight back.Germanys Deutsche Telekom, parent of T-Mobile, today announced that it would tie up closer with Chinas Huawei to sell enterprise cloud services, specifically, as it notes, to pit itself more strongly against the Internet corporations Google and Amazon in future.The news todayalso signals a shift in how DT approaches its place in the cloud services market. To date, a lot of the work that T-Systems has done has been around so-called private cloud services using dedicated VPNs and closed off-net networks. The company notes that last year, revenue from cloud solutions, in particular in the highly secure private cloud, increased by double-figure percentage points at T-Systems alone.What the company is doing now is trying to play at more of Google and Amazons (and Dropbox and Boxs) game: offering services via the public cloud  infrastructure, platforms and applicationsthat can are accessible via thepublic Internet  which it says promises further growth.The newsis part of the carriers bigger goal of doublingrevenues from cloud services to 2 billion ($2.2 billion) by 2018. Similar to Amazon and Google, DT plans to do this across multiple verticals, providing storage to consumers as well as small and large businesses.Todays news covers one aspect of that: large enterprises served by T-Systems, where Huawei will provide hardware and solutions, and T-Systems will provide network management and network.A relationship between Huawei and DTin itself is not completely new  the two have been working together for years and they say that this specificallyis an extension of an agreement announced in March 2015.But what is interesting is to wonder about what kind of an impact this may have on the wider market for cloud services for enterprises, and consumers as well.Huawei has made a lot of inroads in the telecoms world over the years byoffering very competitive (read: low) prices on networking services, and also helping to finance carriers purchases of Huawei kit and services  a strategy that has helped Huawei in particular to gain market share in still-emerging markets. Its also been making very decisive moves to expand in Europe.DT seems to beresisting the pull of eating into margins by cutting prices  it cites research from PwC that claims quality in the sense of failsafe services is the decisive purchase criterion for corporate customers, coming even before price.Yet it doesnt rule out cut prices entirely.DT teaming up with Huawei couldsee a similar approach taken in the cloud services space that Huawei has taken in vendor equipment.We are securing the best balance of price, service and quality for our customers when migrating their IT to the cloud, said Dr. Ferri Abolhassan, Head of the IT Division at T-Systems, in a statement. Its also worth wonderingwho else might come along for the ride. There will likely be more partners announced down the line, as the company notes it is constantly expanding its cloud ecosystem with technology partners who are in turn market leaders. And there seems to be some openings for more partnerships to target certain types of customers: considerhere some of the challenges that companies like Dropbox have been facing, for example.We have reached out to DT to ask if the agreement covers a financial investment by either company in the other, and also to ask about how the two plan to counterGoogle and Amazons approach of winningbusiness by cutting prices.DT  which has been in the cloud services market for 10 years, it says  works with large enterprises like Shell, Daimler and Thyssen-Krupp, and it says it serves some2.6 million users by way of a partnership with SAP.
