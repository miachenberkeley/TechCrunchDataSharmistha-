Sand Hill Road venture firm DFJ is announcing a new, $350 million fund this morning  the firms 12th early-stage vehicle.We chatted with managing director Josh Stein yesterday about the effort, which he says took about two months from start to finish.The biggest takeaway: Expect more of the same from the firm, which typicallyplugsbetween $10 million and $15 million into its startups;has six investment partners, including firm cofounder Steve Jurvetson; and has become known, largely owing to Jurvetsons bets, as an outfit willing to gambleon companies thatarelittle out there sometimesliterally.Among the firms many Jurvetson-led investments: the rocket company SpaceX, the satellite company Planet Labs, and the electric car company Tesla Motors. Indeed, Jurvetson acceptedanaward on behalf of SpaceXat last nights annual Crunchies awards ceremony. The company won for the category of best technology achievement for its two-stage rocket, the Falcon 9, which was designed to transport satellites and SpaceXs own Dragon spacecraft into orbit.Stein wouldnt talk yesterday about the internal rate of returnof any of the firms previous funds. He did say DFJs last funda $325 million vehicle closed exactly two years ago  has backed an as-yet-undisclosedautonomous transportation startup that we think could be the biggest company weve ever been involved with.DFJalso has a growth team, as readers may know; we talked with investor Randy Glein, who helped co-found its later-stage offshoot a decade ago, back in December.Photo of DFJs venture team, courtesy of DFJ.
