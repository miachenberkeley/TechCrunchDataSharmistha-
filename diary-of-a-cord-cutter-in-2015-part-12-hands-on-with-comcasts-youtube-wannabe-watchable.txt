As an increasing number of cable and satellite TV subscribers are cutting the cord or never signing up for television in the first place  the traditional pay TV industry is scrambling to figure out how to compete in this new age of over-the-top services, on-demand streaming, and viewing that takes place on a variety of platforms beyond the living rooms big screen. Weve seen pay TV providers like Verizon, Comcast and Dish more recently entering the space with streaming services of their own.But this week, Comcast also debutedan additional effort at capturing mindshare andmarket sharein thischanging landscapewith the debut of its online and mobile streaming service called Watchable.News of Comcasts plans for Watchable emerged earlier this year, when the company was said to be working on a video service that would feature content from sites it has invested in, like Vice Media and Vox Media, as well as other online sites and channels including The Onion, AwesomenessTV, and others.Now that service is available in beta, forX1 customers via set-top boxes, onthe web, and via a mobile application thats initially available for iOS devices.Includedat launch are the above names as well as a number of other online networks like Discovery Digital Networks, Jukin Media, Newsy, Tastemade, Network A, Fast Company, Machinima, PopSugar, TYT Network, BuzzFeed, Flama, Mashable, Celeb TV, Refinery 29, Scripps Networks Interactive, NBCUniversal, GoPro, Mic, Disneys Maker Studios, Red Bull, DefyMedia,Collective Digital Studio, TEN, Video Detective,GarageMonkey, Future Today.That means Watchable will deliver a number of popular shows catering to the millennial crowd, including Vice, DNews, The Young Turks, Day of Gluttony, SMOSH, and Clevver alongside news and sports programming.In total, there are 30 content partners available at launch and Comcast says that more will be added over time.However, in a blog post announcing the beta launch, the company seemed to characterize the new service as more of an experiment or test, noting howit fits alongside other initiatives, like Comcasts investments in new media;youth-focused services likeXfinity on Campus, a cable TV service for colleges that offers cross-platform viewing; and its recent entry in the streaming video market with Comcast Stream. The company also saidit would be looking for user feedback as Watchable continues to develop.But while the servicescontent is clearly aimed at the younger demographic who tends to watch less television and more video on mobile devices, its unclear why this audience will turn to Watchable instead of, say, YouTube, where theyve already found many of these online networks and favorite shows.At present, theres not asuper-compelling hook to get these viewers to change their established behavior, unlike with competitor Vessel, the startup from Hulus founding CEO Jason Kilar, which tempts viewers with early access to some of YouTubes most popular shows before they hit Googles larger network.Instead, Watchable, for now, feels like more of a me-too effort from Comcast. At best, its a plus for those who havent yet ditched pay TV, as the set-top box integration means theres a more convenient way to viewcontent from favorite online networks in yourliving room.Thats the bigpitch to content creators as well,Comcast notes, saying, many of our Watchable partners have not traditionally had distribution on the TV and we can give them a path to reach new audiences and further monetize their content on the biggest screen in the home.In addition, Variety reports that Comcast is offering a 70 percent share of video ad revenueto creators, which is bigger than Facebook and YouTubes 45 percent share, making their participation a no-brainer.But for those who have weaned themselves off old-school TV, its hard to see the appeal of Watchable in its current format. To make it a worthy alternative to using YouTube or just visiting sites directly on the web, Watchable would have to deliver a captivating user experience.At this point, ithasnt done that.On the app, users get started by creating a username and password, which is easy enough to do.But even there, its easy to see the lack of care thats gone into the app: The welcome screen misspells the word successful and asks, Do you want to continue with Log in.  punctuating it with a period instead of a question mark.Granted, its a beta product, but its still a bad first impression.The apps main screen displays a list of playlists like Editors Picks, Trending Now, as well as topical sections focused on things like technology, food, music, politics and more. A second section presents onlycategories, like Entertainment, Funny, Gaming, Fashion & Style, Food & Travel, Science & Tech, News, Sports, Automotive, and Music. And a third section lets you follow favorite shows youve bookmarked  a section thats empty upon first launch.What the app lacks, right off the back, is personalization. It would make sense to offer an onboarding experience where users tick off things theyre interested in  not just tech or sports, but even niche topics like robots or football, then have Watchable adjust its content selections on the main screen accordingly. A customized video streaming app that was always being refreshed with contentyou cared about would be a more interesting offering than the sort of generic service Watchable is today.(Comcast says that a future version will focus on personalization and social sharing, but it doesnt offer details.)Given that Watchable also has scored a good handfulof popular shows, it also seems that there should be a way for users to quickly tap on their favorites during the initial setup process in order to populatetheir list of tracked shows in the app  another miss on Watchables part, at present.Comcast says the service itself is free, but will be ad-supported. However, after checking out at least a dozen random videos from a variety of networks on the Watchable app, I didnt encounter ads (pre-roll, post-roll, or otherwise) which indicates the ad efforts are still forthcoming.The experience of watching the videos on Watchable is decent enough. The app offers standard player controls, a sharing button, a plus button to follow a show, a 10-second rewind option, and button to shrink the video or expand it to full-screen, landscape mode.Unfortunately, the sharing button itself was buggy. The sharing box on iOS would pop up then disappear before you could select an option and bigsocialnetworks like Facebook and Twitter werent yet included.Meanwhile, Watchable doesnt really help you discover other videos you might like in any way, unlike on YouTube where you can browse related videos suggestions. Instead, when your video finishes, the app just continues playing the next one from the same channel. So for instance, if you just watched a cool video from GoPro about lions, you wouldnt be taken to more lion videos but to whatever was next in line from the network (bears, as it turns out.)This is a problem that largely stems from Watchables still small content selection  YouTube is better for discovery because of its scale, and the ability tofind videos around a given topic from its interface.However, Watchable does have a couple of handy features  it keeps track of where you left off when viewing a video on one platform so you can resume it from the same spot as you switch devices. And it will send notifications when there are new videos from your favorite shows. (Of course, YouTube can do this too.)What would make Watchable interesting  and more competitive with something like Dishs Sling TV, for example  is if it actually leveraged Comcasts relationship with traditional TV networks to offer a blend of cable TV and online video.After all, Sling TV focuses more on bringing cable TV, including sports from ESPN and premium networks like HBO, to the web and mobile devices, but doesnt really focus on integrating video content from new creators who work online.AndVerizons competing service Go90 [disclosure: Verizon owns TechCrunch] is launching with exclusive content, social features including clip-sharing and interest-based communities called crews, as well as a mix of primetime TV, live events and web series. However, Verizons service is mobile-only for now, while Watchable also works on the web and mobile web as well as onset-top boxes.If Watchable had focused more on user experience, which suffers on Sling TV, and a richercontent selection combinedsocial features, to better rival Go90, it could have had a better shot at carving out its own niche right out of the gate.Email me your cord-cutting story, or your YouTube recommendations: sarahp@techcrunch.com
