One day after Uber updated its API to add content experiences for passengers, the U.S. companys biggest rival  Didi Kuaidi in China  has opened its ownplatform up by releasing an SDK for developers and third-parties.Didi Kuaidi, which is valued at $16.5 billion following a recent $3 billion funding round and has an alliance with Lyft and other Uber rivals, gavean initial 30 apps access to its API  including chat app WeChat, Alibabas Alipay, Tencent Map and more  but now it is open to all.The APIs include access to the Hail a Didi Ride button, but also cover its other services which include registered taxis, private cars and test drive services.WeChat, Chinas largest messaging app with over 500 million active users, already includes a feature that lets you book a Didi car from inside the messenger  much likeUbers recent tie-up with Facebook Messengerin the U.S.  but now this functionality is likely tomake its way into many more popular apps in China.If you believe that platforms make the strongest grow stronger, then this news is likely to heap even more pressure on Uber in China, where Didi Kuaidi is the market leader by a long shot. UberChina, which recently landed funding at a $7 billion valuation, claims to have completed one million rides a day across its 22 cities since the summer of 2015. While China is expected to become its largest global market this year, according to Uberdata, Didi Kuaidi is completing some seven million rides each day in the country. Indeed, this week it revealed that it did 1.43 billion rides across its seven businesses (not just taxi rides) during the whole of last year, including 200 million during December alone.This [annual] number is nearly twice the total number of taxi rides in the United States in 2015, and 1.4 times Ubers global rides in the past six years since its launch in 2009, a Didi Kuaidi spokesperson handily pointed out in an email to media.
