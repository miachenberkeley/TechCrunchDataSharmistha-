Uber launched a nonprofitcar-pooling service in China called Peoples Uber last year, and now its biggest rival  and Chinas largest ride-sharing service  has followed suit with a service of its own.Didi Shun Feng Che is the new car-pooling service from Didi Kuaidi, the entity created from the billion dollar merger betweenDidi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, two organizations estimated to account for over 95 percent of Chinas taxi-hailing app industry.Like other carpooling services,Didi Shun Feng Che uses a smartphone app and big data and advanced matching techniques to match car owners with customers looking for a ride. It is initially live in Beijing  from today  and the company said it plans to expand to cover 26 Chinese cities by the end of this month.Didi Kuaidiclaimed it has already recruited one million drivers to the platform, while it is using a varying price structure based on each city. The standard fee will be 5-10 CNY ($0.80-$1.60) with an additional 1 CNY ($0.16) added per kilometerDidi Kuaidiwill make no money from the service, initially at least. The company claimed registered drivers are motivated by cost sharing during their commutes rather than making profit, hence the low fees.The organization landed investment from Chinas top microblogging site  Weibo  last week, and its interesting to note that theDidi Shun Feng Che will be bound to WeChat, Chinas top messaging app which is owned by Didi Kuaidiinvestor Tencent. Thats to say that users will need to log in to the service using their WeChat account, while payment will be handed by the messaging app too.Thats a double win for Tencent, which could see boosted engagement and more users adding their payment details, whileDidi Kuaidistands to benefit from WeChatsfairly advanced payments system, and theverification and accountability that come with using a personsown account.Finally, the company is pushing this new programas a green initiative that could help cut down on Chinas chronic urban pollution problems. It has partnered with theCivilization Office of Beijings Haidian District, to launch the service today.Its worth recalling that carpooling isa very different proposition to taxi-hailing, and its still very much in its infancy in China.For now, neither Uber nor Didi Kuaidiis charging for its respectiveservice, its about brand and platform building at this point.In other news, and further proof of its ambition, Didi Kuaidi recently pledged to spend$161 million to give its customers two15 RMB (US$2.42) discount per day if they use its newExpress service.Thatll make Ubers (already stiff) challenge ofdenting its rivals dominance in China even harder.
