, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Recently I had the opportunity to check in with newly appointed Digg CEO, Gary Liu, the man at the helm whosleading the rebirth of the platform that was once the darling of the internet.We discussed why Digg has struggled in recent years to live up to market predictions for the product; how Digg is evolving and differentiating itself in the highly crowded content market and how content creators can evolve in a world of the ever disappearing ad dollar.Liu also reminisced abouthis time at Google and Spotify and the lessons he learned there. how Digg engage their audience with commenting whilst preventing trolling and what people should look for when contemplating what early stage startup to join.
