By now youve surely heard that moving forward, every company will be a software company, and that shift is happening now as companies large and small scramble to transform into digitally-driven organizations.Wherever you turn, businessesare facing tremendous disruptive pressure. Whats interesting is that the theory about how firmsshould be dealing with this massive change is itself in flux, transforming if you will, as organizationscome to grips with the idea that the most basic ways they do business are being called into question.Justover a yearago when I researched this topic, I found that the general method fordealing with disruption was developingpockets of innovation inside a companyusing labs or incubators to prime the innovation pump.Today, when I explore the same issues, Im finding thatcompanies are taking a much more comprehensive approach that has to do with reviewingevery department and business process in the organization.The issuewith the lab or incubator conceptis how youmove thekind of innovative thinking from that internal innovation test bed into the organization at large. The reasoning behind isolating innovation wassound enough, because those fledgling ideas would very likely be sucked up into the vacuum of existing business policies where theyget lost forever in a haze of bureaucratic negativity. If you want to kill innovation, you just keep saying no.The new thinking says you have to start looking at the big picture from the first day and you have to consider the impact that these changes are going to have on the entire organization. You have to figure out how to grease the skids of creativityso they dont get slowed down by HR, legal, IT and by all the systems and departments that have been put in place to protect and limit these kinds of changes inside large organizations. Now the idea is to teach those well-meaning naysayers to get the heck out of the way and for themto also find new ways of achieving their goals and requirements as the organization marches forward into a digitally driven future.As weve seen through the experience ofimplementing individual enterprisesystems such as content management, ERP or CRM trying to get a large organization moving in the same direction across departments is a huge challenge. When you suddenly putyour whole business model on notice, a pocket of innovation is just too incremental to deal with that scale of change.Aaron Levie, CEO at Box is co-teaching a course this semester at Stanford with professor Rob Siegel called TheIndustrialists Dilemmawhere they explore the kinds of issues large established organizations face as they maneuver through thesemassive changes.What happens when you take a business thats good at analog stores, and software can deliver new disruptive experiences? How do they respond? No product is more physical and analog than a retail store or car. We are seeing those [delivery models] inverted and flipped over by technology, says Levie.When I spoke to Edward Hiaett, SVP of services at Pivotal and in charge of Pivotal Labs, at Web Summit in October, 2014, his companywas one of those organizations working on the pockets of innovation approach, but he said his companys thinking has evolved.When he looks at a firmlike one of his clients, Ford, he sees a company that has to completely change the way it does business. In the next decade its possible that many people wont own cars in the traditional sense. In factthey might not even be driving them anymore as self-driven cars become more widespread. That means the whole firmhasto start examining all of its long-established systems aroundhow they design, deliver, market and sell automobiles.And they need to start looking at these systems now before the deliverymodel changes, Hiaett says. It doesnt mean it changes all at once, but if Ford is in the midst of pivotingfrom a business selling carsto one thats in thethe mobility business, its clearly going to have a majorimpact on all of the companys long-established business processes.This means that the executive suite has to have a clearplan forthe future, and a way toputthe company on the road toward delivering on that vision.They cant hide the innovation team in the basement. They need to inject innovative thinking into every process in the organization and that requires reconsidering every process, says Michael Krigsman, founder of cxotalk.com, a weekly web-based talk show on which Krigsmaninterviews leading tech industry executives.The successful executivesare able to embrace change. This is a very key point and its really the most difficult thing about this. With the exception of startups, every company has an established business model and way they do business. Product lines, services and employees have been optimized for standard processes, Krigsman told TechCrunch.Executives require a particular set of skills and approaches asthe organization shifts:Levie says that he sees CIOs with these kinds of traits in his job as Box CEO, but he says he has seen organizations held back whenthere isnt a unified front inthe C suite.I think the majority of companies recognize how disruptive these trends are. A small percentage recognize this at the CEO level and board level. Me personally in building and selling enterprise software, we interact with a large percentage of CIOs that get it, but dont always have the support from CEO and that makes it harder without top-down support, Levie explained.As we tend to do in this business, we have been attacking this type of change by throwing different technologies at it, and while technology can certainly help, it requires a much more personal approach by management, one that takes the people who have to implement these massive changes into account.Photo by cartoonresource on Shutterstock.Just lastweek Accenture released its annual 2016 Technology Vision Reportand the consulting juggernaut says the success of any company going through fundamental digital transformation is understanding that its first and foremost a people issue.Finding ways to help people acrossthis digital divide and the culture shock that rapid change brings is going to be just as important as the technology we use to get there, says Marc Carrel-Billiard, global tech R&D Lead on digital transformation at Accenture.When we talk to clients, we usually start bytalking about technology, but [typically] after 15 minutes, we shift gears. We start talkingabout people and the digital culture shock they are in. If [clients]want to be digital, itsnot just about technological changebecause its coming [regardless]. Companiesneed to think about people or it will not work at all, he said.One lesson we should have learned after all these years of trying to implement incremental change management is that its always been about people and managing how to deal with these changes. Today, the speed of change is coming so quickly, and the requirements are so daunting, that its easy to get overwhelmed.It requires companies to shift their mindset completely, Krigsman says.Companies that do this well are able toadopt a beginners mind set, taking an approach of looking at things from a fresh perspective, he explained.This could involve, for example, having fewer impediments for customer service by implementing systems so thatinformation flows more seamlessly from one departmentto another and across systems.What does that mean to customers and internal processes? It comes down to being willing to experiment and look at things through a new lens, Krigsman said.In fact, he recommends that companies partner with startups, which tend to be smaller, more nimble and creative. The reason for that, the big challenge is how do you inject new thinking. And thats a very hard thing to do because it comes down to several things, the ingrained behaviors of people who have been doing this job this way for a long time, he said.By injectingnew thinking into a company, employees can start to see that there are differentways to handlethosestandard business practices and can begin to incorporatethattype of creative thinkinginto their organizational philosophy.When you consider that 88 percent of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955 are now gone, its not hard to see that change has always been with us, but the rate of change is accelerating dramatically due in large part to the disruption brought about by digital transformation.The cool thing is that incumbents recognize that the same assets that can hold them back, can also be used to compete in a different guise, Levie said. That means its not all gloom and doom, companiesjust have to start thinking much more creatively about theirdigital future and the effect that will have across theorganization.
