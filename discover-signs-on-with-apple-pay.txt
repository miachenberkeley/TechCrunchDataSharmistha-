Credit card provider Discover will join Apple Pays ranks beginning this fall, the company announced today. Apple Pay already supports cards from Visa, MasterCard and American Express, and with Discover, it will reach the overwhelming majority of cardholders in the U.S. Discover was the last noteworthy holdout from the service.Apple Pay with Discover will work the same way it does with other providers  meaning youll be able to pay in-store at NFC-enabled terminals using the Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as the Apple Watch, in addition to using the most recent iPads for online purchases.Its not clear what led to the delay with Discover specifically, but Apple likely managed to negotiate similar terms to what it has in place with other card providers with this new arrangement. The company also notes that its existing services for cardholders will apply when users activate their cards on Apple Pay, too.This was one of the last major hurdles Apple Pay needed to clear for its domestic offering, and according to a recent WSJ report its now setting its sights on international expansion, beginning with Canada this November.
