Disneys Research Hub is one of my favorite things on the Internet. Just about every time they release a new video, its something immediately understandable (in terms of its use cases) and yet deeply complex (in terms of the execution.)Take this software theyve just demonstrated: it lets the user create a 3D-printable mount to connect just about anything (your phone, a controller, a tea cup) to just about anything else (your desk, your car, a guitar.)So why does this matter?Because if 3D printing is ever going to matter to the general public, it needs to tackle two huge hurdles: it needs to do more than print mostly-useless plastic tchotchkes (think integrated electronics printing, a la the Voltera), and it needs to be far more accessible than it currently is. No one wants to learn how to use CAD/Blender/etc. just to use a 3D printer.Something like this allows is the first step toward allowing Joe Clueless to say Hey, I have this table and this phone. Make me a mount! and have it just happen. No modeling needed, no digging through Thingiverse for a mount that may or may not actually work with your phone.Or you could say I have this tea cup and I want to mount it to my guitar. Why? DONT ASK QUESTIONS, COMPUTER. JUST CREATE. and bam: its called out from the ether like youre some sort of plastic-extruding sorcerer.Awesome.
