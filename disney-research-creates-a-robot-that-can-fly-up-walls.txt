Disney Research and the research group at ETH Zurich have created a car that can drive, fly, jump, and ride up walls. By using propellers and wheels, the robot can fly over obstacles and then smack against walls for a little vertical action.Called the VertiGo, the robots wheels are actually unpowered. All of the motion comes from the propellers which send it rolling across the ground and then push it up against the wall as necessary.From the white paper:Its not immediately clear why youd want something like this but I suspect it would be a great solution for odd stuff like managing repairs on a distant ceiling or move the robot to a location far out of reach by mere humans. You could also dress the robot up like Daffy Duck and finally make that old mallard fly.via Spectrum
