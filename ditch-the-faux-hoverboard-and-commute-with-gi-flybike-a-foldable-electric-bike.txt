Forget electric skateboards and faux hoverboards. One startup is trying to convince commuters to stick to the good old-fashioned bicycle.Meet the Gi FlyBike, a folding electric bike that cantravel up to 40 miles on one charge.Thebike, which is now available on Kickstarter, will also be for sale on Amazon Exclusives, the e-commerce companys online store featuring up-and-coming brands.Started by three friends from Argentina, Gi FlyBike was conceived aftera public transportation strike left the entire country without transportation.So how does an electric bike work?While riders still pedal, they are assisted by an electric engine that will propel them to a maximum speed of 15 mph. The motor alsoworks on hills and rough terrain, meaning riders arent limited to the street.The bike itself is made of aircraft grade aluminum, and weighs 37 pounds, allowingit to quickly fold in half for storage or car travel.Having a battery pack strapped to the back of a bike presents a great deal of technological opportunities, which the Gi FlyBike takes full advantage of.For example, the bike has a built-in phone charger, so you can use the onboard battery to chargeyour device whileyou ride. The battery also powersa smart locking system; a folded bike will automatically lock when you are 15 feet away. Riders can even use the companys app to transfer unlockprivileges to a friend, letting them temporarily borrow your bike.The bike, which has already raisedalmost $300,000 more than its goal of $75,000, is currently available on Kickstarterfor a pre-order price of $2,290.
