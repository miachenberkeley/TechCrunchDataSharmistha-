Docker today announced the general availability of its commercial solutions for businesses that want to use its container management software. Dockers commercial solution will be available through Docker itself, but also from Amazon Web Services, IBM and Microsoft, starting at a relatively modest price of $150 per month.For that, subscribers get 24/7 support for their Docker deployments, a license for up to 10certified Docker Engines and Dockers management tools. The company will also offer additional service tiers, depending on its customers needs.At the core of this new service is the Docker Trusted Registry. This was built on top of the Docker Hub Registry, Dockers service for storing containers, but enterprises can now use it on-premise and behind their firewalls to store and share Docker images. The on-premise registry offersLDAP and Active Directory integration, so businesses can use their existing authentication systems to set up role-based access policies for the service and keep audit logs.The Trusted Registry has been in beta since February and is currently in use at over 800 companies.Since its launch at DockerCon SF last June, Docker Hub has attracted hundreds of thousands of users and tens of thousands of organizations, all of whom have given us valuable feedback on the nature of the commercial solutions they need from us to support deployment of business-critical distributed applications, said Ben Golub, Dockers CEO. We have used this feedback, as well as feedback from our Docker Trusted Registry beta program, to define our commercial solutions for production environments.With IBM, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services on board as resellers and a modest subscription price, Docker shouldbe able to attract a large number of businesses that will want to subscribe to this service.
