Of the companies betting on Apple Watchs third-party ecosystem as a source of consumer interest, DODOcase might be one of the most aggressive out of the gate. The company has launched two Apple Watch charging accessories, both available for pre-order, including a stand for home use and a dual-charging device thats ideal on the nightstand or as a travel companion.Both these devices carry DODOcases signature style, though the Dual Charging Dock Organizer is more reminiscent of the companys other accessories, including its book-like iPad cases. The Organizer also resembles a book, in this case a smaller hardcover, and within youll find a combo Apple Watch and iPhone charging cradle made of Baltic Birch.The Organizers wood base attaches to the book cover enclosure via four magnets, and folds up nicely for stowing away in a bag or suitcase. You need to bring your own Apple Watch charging puck, but thats essentially standard for this category of accessories. Theres some clever channel routing via the magnetic pegs under the wood base, and the simple slot for your iPhone holds both 6 and 6 Plus comfortably, with or without a case.The Watch Charging Stand is a more substantial affair, made out of solid carved wood and featuring a heady steel base that means it wont move around when you take off your Apple Watch. Again, you need to bring-your-own charger, but the channel routing DODOcase has created here means you can tuck the cable parts out of sight fairly easily. This one feels at home on the desk or nightstand, too, but isnt nearly as versatile for travel (and doesnt also support your iPhone).The Charging Stand is made of solid American Walnut sourced in California, and is handmade in San Francisco, which probably helps account of its $99.95 price. TheDual Charging Dock Organizer retails for $79.95, comes in two colors and will probably quickly become your bosom buddy for hotel nightstand use. Both are good options, if youre looking for this kind of Apple Watch add-on, but the versatility of the organizer makes it my first choice.
