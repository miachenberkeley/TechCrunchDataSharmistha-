Dollar Shave Club started out as a subscription razor service (in fact, its how I get my razors), but over the past couple of years the startupsbeen expandingits lineup with products like butt wipes and post shave balm. Today itsmoving into hairstyling with a range of products  gel, cream, paste, fiber, and even clay.(Seriously, I didnt know hair clay was a thing.)Co-founder and CEO Michael Dubin told me that the aim is to help guys find the right product for their hair, rather than relying on a friend whose hair is nothing like theirs, or a barber whos basing their recommendation on the haircut, or going to the store and seeing a long line of products that all kind of look the same and come out of the same tubes.So not only is the startup announcing a lineup Boogies hair products (Boogies Bold Hair Gel for $7, Boogies Casual Hair Clay for $10, etc.), its also helping you choose those productsthrough something called Boogies Match. I wasnt able to try the match product out myself (or the hair gel), but Dubin said its basically an online quiz asking you about your hair and how you want it to look, with questions like, How much shine do you want? At the end of the quiz, itll recommend the right product for your hair.If, for some reason, youre a sourpuss who doesntlike quizzes, therell also be a more straightforward comparison chart. And eitherway, thanks to The Boogies Hairantee (look, I dont make up these names), if youre not happy with the recommended product, Dubin said the company will give you the next best product that might be right for you, free of charge.He added that Dollar Shave Club doesnt launch stuff just to launch stuff. So how does it decide what to do next?Were really focused on achieving our mission for guys, which is helping them lead better lives, Dubin said. We think we can do that in every corner of the bathroom.Healso told me Dollar Shave Clubsaw $65 million in revenue in 2014, with 1.7 million subscribers and projected revenue of $140 million for 2015.
