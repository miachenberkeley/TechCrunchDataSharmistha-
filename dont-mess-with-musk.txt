Earlier today, longtime Bay Area venture capitalist Stewart Alsop posted something fairly unexpectedto Medium.In a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk titledBanned by Tesla, Alsop wrote of his surprise that Tesla would cancel theModel X hed ordered and that Alsop hasbeen eagerly awaiting. (Alsop says in the post itwas to bered, withblack leather seatsand TeslasLudicrous Speed option.)It was no clerical or accounting error. Alsop says that after complaining  also on Medium  about what he viewed as the Model Xs poorly orchestrated launch event back in September (Alsop titled that one, @ElonMusk, You should be ashamed of yourself), Musk personally got involved in his order.Specifically, says Alsop, he canceled it.We reached out to both Alsop and Tesla earlier to find out more about the incident, which we gatheris unprecedented, but have yet to hear back from either.What we do know, from Alsops post, is that the two talked on the phone at some point, at which point Musk told Alsop that he was not comfortable with him owning a Tesla after having been flamed by Alsop publicly.In fact, says Alsop, Musk hasdecided that Alsopcant own one of his cars. (We dont know if Alsop is facing some kind of lifetime ban or if hes exaggerating based on the cancelation of the carhed ordered.)Either way, the alleged move, which seemsequal parts petty and peculiar,comes on the heels of another strange story that made the rounds last week, one in which Musk allegedly took possession of a Model S that was slated for delivery to a customer, much to the Florida mans chagrin. (Muskwas reportedly using it as his personal vehicle to test out a new version of Teslas autopilot software.)In the latter case, Tesla apologized, cited human error, and said it was working to ensure that it never happens again.Dont expect an apology this time. We posted this story Monday night; Musk has since tweeted, Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention.Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2016
