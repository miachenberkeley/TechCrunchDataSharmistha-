Doormancan be a useful service for people who hate missing deliveries. Now it can help youget those products in the mail again, too.Rather than coming home from work to find a missed delivery slip,Doorman customers canset a delivery time between 6pm and midnight thats convenient for them (packages get delivered to Doorman first, and then to the consumer). The new return service works in a similar way  you just schedule a pickup in that same time window.CEO Zander Adell said this was a much-requested feature, particularly for customers who both shop and return regularly withonline stores, leaving them with all of these returns sitting in [their]house until they found the time to schlep all theboxes to the UPS store. So Doorman started experimenting with making returns available to its $29 per month Gold Plan members last year, then rolled it out to all customers in the latest app update.Adell noted that technically, Doorman customers can use the service for other types of shipping, not just returns  but returns are the most obvious fit for now, since you have to handle the packing and labeling yourself.This is a pretty capital-intensive business, Adell said. Its not hook a computer up to the internet and make money SaaS model. We reallyhave toprove [to investors] that we can do this efficiently, and wehave done that over and over again.Beyond allowing Doorman toexpand geographically (it started in San Francisco, thenrecently launched in Chicago and New York City), the funding will also helpit pursue more retail partnerships  Adell said its already working with mattress startup Casper to handle same-day deliveries in San Francisco.
