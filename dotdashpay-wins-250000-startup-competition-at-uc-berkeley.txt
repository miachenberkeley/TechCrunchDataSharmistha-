Last summer, we told you about a new competition sponsored by Pejman Mar Ventures, a two-year-old, Palo Alto, Ca., venture firm with close ties to Stanford anda growing interest in technologies coming out of the University of California, Berkeley.Today, the firm is announcing thewinner of that competition.Evidently, itcouldnt resistcreatingtwo new award categories, too, owingtothe quality of the companies with which it met.The central, $250,000 prize  which could have been won by any UC Berkeley student, faculty member, or alum  goes to DotDashPay.DotDashPayis developing a hardware and software platform that promises to make it easy for machine makers to implement payments. All it takes, says its founders  twoof whom are computer science Ph.D candidates at UC  is a couple of wires and a few lines of code to accept credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Android Pay, Bitcoin, and more on nearly any machine.In an additional boonfor UC Berkeley, theschool will receive 10 percent of Pejman Mars stake in DotDashPay. (We dont know exactly what that translates into; Pejman Mar isnt saying how big a stake its getting for its $250,000 check.)A second company that Pejman Mar decided to fund with a smaller, $20,000uncapped note is Tinkering Labs, a kit company that provides its young users with parts and ideas about what they can make entirely on their own. For example, one kit comes with markers, screw drivers, a small motor and numerous wooden pieces, along with suggestion cards, including to build a machine that draws curvy lines.Tinkering Labs, which won Pejman Mars edtech award, was cofounded by Nik Morozoff, who earned his MBA at Haas; he met his cofounders at the UC Berkeley business incubator SkyDeck.Last, Pejman Mar wrote a$5,000 check  a social impact award  to Thera, an online chat platform that connects survivors of sexual assault to vetted volunteers for anonymous and confidential support. This check alsocame in the form of an uncapped note, says Pejman Mar cofounder Pejman Nozad.No doubt the competition was a big hit on campus, where budding entrepreneurs arent paid nearly as much attention as their peers at Stanford, though that looks to be changing.In fact, theprizes from Pejman Marcome on the heels of what may wind up proving a banner week for the University of California, whichannounced plans on Tuesday toinvest$250 million in startups that are emerging from its 10-school system.Students, professors, and alumni are all eligible.The school said its particularly interested in startups that are focused on the life sciences, technology, energy, agriculture, and materials.
