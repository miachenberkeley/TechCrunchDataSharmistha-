Pixelapse, a startup incubated by Y Combinator and StartX, has been acquired by cloud storage company Dropbox.The news was announced on the Pixelapse blog, and Dropbox has confirmed it.Pixelapse offers version control and other collaboration tools for designers. Back in 2013, we compared it to both GitHub and, yep, Dropbox. (Its also been adding integrations with Dropbox.)The company says that Pixelapse will continue to operate as a standalone product for the next year, but it sounds like the eventual goal is to migrate customers over to Dropbox.The founders write:We started Pixelapse with the mission of building the definitive version control and collaboration platform for creatives. Since then, weve been fortunate to become a part of the daily workflow of tens of thousands of freelance designers and creative teams. The prospect of developing products at Dropbox that expand this vision to millions of users is tremendously exciting.Our new development efforts will be focused on bringing the same kinds of collaboration and workflow experiences that youre used to in Pixelapse over to the core Dropbox product.The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
