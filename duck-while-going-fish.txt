Playing cards, just like anything else, are ripe for disruption. Ive purchased cards in airports, a CVS and the supermarketbut never online. That might change because of this Kickstarter. This is the biggest news since the Kevlar Pocket Square.If you ever wondered what youd do if someone pulled a gun on you as you were playing poker, wonder no more. A group called Sly Kly are seeing pickup on its playing cards that are made out of Kevlar or carbon fiberyour choice. These materials, as you probably know, can take a bullet. Im not the only person who feels like I need this added protection, as theyve already raised $40,371 as of writing (way past their $25,000 goal).Ive never shot a deck of regular playing cars, since I dont really like guns and most certainly dont have a gun, but I imagine that itd put a hole right through every card. These Kevlar ones? Not so much. Have a watch as their deflection of bullets is put on display:Im sure Sly Kly doesnt want to say that these cards could save your life, but if you were to happen to have them in a front shirt pocket and someone aimed a gun in your general direction from far away and fired it directly at the area where your cards were storedthey might save your life.In reality, these cards wont bend or tear like regular cheap playing cards and I assume that theyll last much much longer.They come in this nifty metal case and you can nab a carbon fiber set by pledging $130 or more or a Kevlar set by pledging $135 or more. Small price to play for bulletproof playing cards. I guess.
