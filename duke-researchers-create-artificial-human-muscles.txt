As a representative of M.U.S.C.L.E., I find artificial muscles a bit unseemly. However, researchers at Duke University have been able to grow their own twitching tissue, a first that could allow researchers to test drugs on working muscle without damaging a live host.From the release:Interestingly there is no mention here of using these tiny bits of working muscle  muscle that twitches in response to electricity and responds to drugs just like regular human muscle  as replacements for lost musculature, which suggests the samples are still too small to be useful. However, this is the first time human-equivalent muscle has been grown in the lab and it looks like it will be a real boon for researchers trying to figure out the effects of various diseases and drugs on the body. That said, I fully intend to eventually embed huge chunks of artificial muscle into my body and walk around looking like the Hulk.
