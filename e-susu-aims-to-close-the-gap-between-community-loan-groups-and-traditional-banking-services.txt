An interestinghackpresented on stage todayat TechCrunch Disrupt New York 2016is a platform fornon-traditional banking services. Called e-susu, the app is designed forpeople who are involved with informal loan groups to help thembetter manage theprocess of lending money within a family or community group, as well as encouraging the saving processviaincreased transparency.The platformlets userstrack how much money is owed within the group, when payments are due and when they have been paid. Users can also create goals to specify what they are saving for, and agroup messaging feature is also included, while the team plans to also integrate the ability to make payments directly intothe platform in future.All sorts of cultures have some form of informal group loans for centuries to provide alternatives to traditional banking services, notesteam member Nikki Puckett, 23, who when not attending tech hackathons works infinance.The name for these loan groups vary in different countries but susu is one example hence the app being called e-susu.Sometimes people can get in trouble for participating in it because if they are at work and they are collecting money that can be seen as something illegal. This takes that risk away and brings it to online platform and puts everything in one spot, all the group knows exactly whats going on. So were trying to create an easily accessible platform, Puckett tells TechCrunch.Communities participate in banking services but a lot of that is non-traditional. So were trying to bridge that gap by taking something thats already done and just making it more visible, making it so that you can point to this and say now I can build credit because look at my history here.This is something which you could go to a bank and say we have participated in a savings program, she adds.Puckettworked on the core concept and business planning for the team, as well as presenting the e-susu hack on stage.Another member of the team, Mahdi Hamdi, a 28-year-old full stack developer, reckonsthat as well as serving groups of people who are excluded from banking credit, the platformcould have wider appeal with young people generally  because he arguesmillennials dont trust traditional financial institutions.I think millennials are shifting and renewing everything. Tourism now, people they dont want to go to hotels, they want to stay with locals, even with finance  the shocking statistic I heard is that 73 per cent of millennials they prefer going to the dentist togoing to a bank, he tells TechCrunch. We really dont feel safe with these formal, financial institutions.The team say they plan to continue working on the app  having originally come up with the concept at a priorhackathon. TC Disrupt NY is the pairs second hackathon.
