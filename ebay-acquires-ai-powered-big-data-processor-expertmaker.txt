eBay announced today that it is acquiring Expertmaker, a Swedish company that specializes in analysis of big data with a machine-learning twist.Expertmaker was founded in 2006; in its own words, the companys genetics-inspired multi-AI approach, extracts hidden value in your data. I couldnt have said it better myself. So if you have a ton of noisy data, as eBay most certainly does, these are the guys who can wrangle it and produce something useful.Lars Hard, Expertmakers founder, will continue on as head of the team, though the company will operate under eBays Structured Data initiative, which is led by Amit Menipaz. The rest of Expertmakers employees will, mercifully, be allowed to continue working from their office in Malm.The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it should be finalized in Q2 FY16, so expect details then.
