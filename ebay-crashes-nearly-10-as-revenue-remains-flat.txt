Investors clearly dont likewhat they see with eBay, which reported its fourth-quarter earnings today  sending shares down around 10% in extended trading.The company said it had earnings of 50 cents per shareon revenue of $2.3 billion.Analysts were expecting earnings of 50 cents a share on revenue of $2.32 billion. Net revenue hardly changed from the same quarter last year, and gross merchandise volume remained basically unchanged as well.In order to continue growing its business, it needs thosenumbers to keep going up, and thats something that investors are clearly paying close attention.What that could signal was a weaker holiday quarter  which is crucial for e-commerce companies  than what people were hoping.eBay split from PayPal last year, essentially turning it into a new company without the payments service buoying it. Since the split, the companys shares have performed so-so.The companys services didnt grow, but they didnt decline, either.There are probably a lot of additional forces at play in tech across the board, including what might be a lighter holiday season and major negative macroeconomic trends. But it still seems that what eBay is doing isnt what investors are looking for, as the company increasingly competes with companies like Amazon.And if youre competing with Amazon, you need the amount of things people are selling  or at least, the amount of money youre making off your total sales  to keep going up.(Update:Added some additional clarification around the performance of the stock, including a correction regarding the companys Q2 stock drop related to the PayPal spinoff.)
