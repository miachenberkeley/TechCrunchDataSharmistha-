eBay reported its third-quarter earnings today  its first as a separate company from PayPal  and beat investor expectations with earnings of 43 cents per shareand $2.1 billion in revenue.Investors were looking for $2.09 billion in revenue and earnings of 40 cents per share.The report sent eBay shares straight up, with the companys stock rising 9 percent in extended trading.In the second quarter this year, eBays standalone revenue was $2.11 billion, and in the same quarter last year the companys revenue was $2.15 billion.Prior to the earnings report, shares of eBay wereup around 2.5 percent on the year.Still, the numbers are not as good as the prior year. Revenue was down 2 percent year-over-year, and the companys earnings per share fell 6 percent year-over-year. The company reported GMV of $19.6 billion, compared to GMV of about $20 billion in the same quarter the year earlier.eBay is also selling off its enterprise unit,essentially splitting off both PayPal and eBay enterprise as part of the companys earnings report.Taken together, this essentially pegs eBays core services as a stable, but not necessarily exciting business in terms of growth.The company unveiled a new version of its app in September this year with a more unified mobile experience. At the time, the companys apps had been downloaded 279 million times.As expected eBay faces increasingly stiff challenges from selling competitors like Amazon, but it does seem like investors are showing a little bit of faith in the companys core business model.For the next quarter, the company is forecasting $2.275 billion to $2.325 billion in revenue, and earnings of between 47 cents and 49 cents per share.
