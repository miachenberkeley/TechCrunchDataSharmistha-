A European legal opinion regardingFacebooks alleged data-sharing co-operation with the NSA/PRISM dragnet surveillance program thatsdue to be issued by theAdvocate General (AG) of Europes top court is now slated to be deliveredon September 23.The AG had originally been scheduled to deliver the opinion in June. The delay has not been explained by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).The issueinvolves thethe so-called Safe Harbor agreement, which governs data flows from Europeto the U.S. but which remains problematic in the wake of the Snowden revelations disclosure ofthe extent of U.S. intelligence agency surveillance program activity.Back in 2013the Europe vs Facebook (EvF) privacy organization, led by data protection activist and lawyer Max Schrems, filed complaints against several U.S. tech giants  including Facebook  for their alleged collaboration with PRISM.The EvF said it wasseeking clarity on European-U.S. data-sharinglaw to determine whether mass transfer of personal data to a foreign intelligence agency is legal under European law.The Irish data protection authority, the country where Facebooks European headquarters are based, quickly dismissed the EvF complaint citing Safe Harbor as the justification for any data-sharing under PRISM. Schrems challenged that decision at the Irish High Court which referred the case to the ECJ in June last year. So the complaint has movedfrom Ireland to Luxembourg  where the ECJs AG is now due to opine on whether the Irish DPA was right to dismiss the complaint or not later this month.The AGs opinion is non-binding but does informthe thinking of the15 judges of the ECJ as they work to determinethe courts final ruling expected laterthis year.EvF notes that in the majority of cases the ECJ follows the AGs opinion.In addition, in an ECJ hearing back in March, the European Commission conceded the Safe Harbor agreement does not provide adequate protection, and has repeatedly saidan update for the system will be forthcoming  althoughthis has yet to materialize.EvF also suggests the ECJand AG wererather critical of Safe Harbor and the role of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, during the hearing on March 23.Speculating on possible outcomes of the AG opinion, EvFsays it could range from narrowing the interpretation of Safe Harbor, invalidating the Safe Harbor decision or an even broader ruling on international data transfers taking into consideration the European Unions fundamental right to data protection in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.Legal researcher Brendan Van Alsenoy, who has been following the case, said the AGs line of questioning in the earlier hearing suggeststhe Safe Harbor decision cannot be insulated from a full and proper review.If I were to speculate, I would think the AG inclined to answer the question referred in favor of the plaintiff and argue that national DPAs are not absolutely bound by a Commission finding of adequacy, he tells TechCrunch.The real question is whether or not the AG will recommend invalidation of Safe Harbor, or whether he will merely recommend setting aside the provisions which could be seen to violate Directive 95/46/EC, he adds.Any such ruling invalidating Safe Harbor by the ECJ could of course have significant implications for a number of U.S. technology companies, not just Facebook, if they have users in Europe andare processing user data outside Europe.Nor would it be the first time an ECJ ruling has forcedU.S. tech companies to change their ways. Back in May 2014 an ECJ ruling that was quickly dubbed the right to be forgotten putGoogle on the back foot,becauseit requires search engines process delisting requests from private individuals.Arguably that ECJ ruling has sparked wider pro-privacy debate over the pond, with some Americans now calling loudly for a similar right to be offered to web users in the U.S.The EvF PRISM-relatedlegal action is being financed by crowdfunding donations  the organization has raised more than65,000 in pledges to date.Schrems has also been trying to bring a class action law suit against Facebook for failing to protect user privacy,including from the PRISM program. That action is being funded by a law firm on a no-win no fee basis.
