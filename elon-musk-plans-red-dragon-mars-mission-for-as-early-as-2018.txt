Somewhere, Elon Musk is bored; you can tell because he starts tweeting like crazy about colonizing the solar system. Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018, SpaceX tweeted this morning, apropos of nothing. More details followed, in typical Musk style.Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 27, 2016Musk did say that with propulsive landing (as opposed to parachute or impact padding) and the companys own high-performance heat shield, setting down on the surface of a planet  be it Mars, Venus, or Neptune  would be a cakewalk. But getting there is a different story.But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 27, 2016In other words, the first SpaceX missions to Mars will definitely be uncrewed  but that was a given, considering the risks involved. Musk will certainly provide more details later, but there will be as many test runs and supply missions as it takes to bring risk down to an acceptable level.The cabin will have to be upgraded, as well. Being stuck in an SUV-sized space for even a few hours here on Earth isnt a pleasant experience, let alone months or years with nothing outside but hard vacuum. No, the current generation of Dragons will stay relatively close to the planet for now, at least when theyve got people in them.
