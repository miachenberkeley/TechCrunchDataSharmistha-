Elon Musk and Sam Altman discussed everything from alien life to nuclear fusion onstage at the Vanity Fair Summiton Tuesday, including how soon we can expect to get ourcars to drive us places at the touch of a button.Self-driving cars are going to get here much faster than people think, Altman said. He thought wed see them in three to four years. Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, put it closer to two to three years.Theres a point where its not just driving in Palo Alto or Mountain View, Musk added, obviously alluding to Googles self-driving car tests on the Silicon Valley peninsula. But it will be an end to end point anywhere.Google has been careful in feeding the press a closer date of release for its version of an autonomous vehicle. Some reports say the project aims to ready by2020.Musk has previously mentioned his concern over a lack of regulations in the industry and that this lack could delay the release of self-driving cars into the market, marking that release out to 2022 or beyond.There was a lot of chatter around self-driving features for the Teslas p85 D. Some even believed the D might stand for driver assistance. It did offer adaptive cruise control features, but it was not truly driverless.The cars with version 7 software will be able to essentially steer themselves so long as there arent any sharp turns, according to Musk.The Tesla CEO also told the audience there are currently 600 to 700 Tesla owners testing that software on the road right now and that he plans to release version 7 very soon.
