If youre an online writer or publisher and you want to include a picture from Imgur, its now easy to do so in a totally legit way thanks to the image-sharing sites new embedding capabilities.In other words, the company says that when youre looking at any public image  or GIF on Imgur, youll now find an embed option in the Post Options menu, allowing you to copy a line of HTML and reproduce the contenton your site.Not that it was all that hard before to download and re-upload an image. Nonetheless, adding embedding capabilities has helped sites like YouTube and Twitter distribute their content across the web, and we might see somethingsimilar here  so even if you arent someone who embeds pictures yourself, you might start seeing a lot more Imgur content on other sites.Plus, by supporting embeds, Imgur gets more control over the experience  for one thing, it guarantees that the image will be reproduced with proper attribution. Embeds could also give Imgur (and the users who uploadthese images in the first place) more data about how the contentis being published, shared and viewed.One thing to keep in mind is that not all sites will immediately support this embed code. Sadly, TechCrunchs version of WordPress is pretty restrictive, so I had to go with a screenshot above, instead of an embed. (Hopefully we can get that fixed soon.)
