Rumors that Dell is going to buy Massachusetts-based storage giant EMC, first reported yesterday in the Wall Street Journal,have been flying fast and furiously.The deal could be valued as high as $27/share, or just shy of $52billion, according to one report,sendingEMCs stock soaring today. If the rumors are true,it could be one of the biggest tech M&A deals in history and couldgive Dell a significant stake in the enterprise business.Its unclear when the talks began  Dan Primack writingfor Fortunes Term Sheet indicated the talks have been on-going for at least two months, but a source told TechCrunch it was more like the lastthree weeks. The talks could have been initiated at thehighest levels with a phone call between CEOs Joe Tucci and Michael Dell, according to our source.EMC has been purportedlylooking for a buyerfor a year now  for a time it was rumored to be HP after activist investor Elliot Management began to pressure the company to spinoff its biggest piece, VMware. The deal could be about long-time CEO Tucci looking fora way to retire and give his company a soft landing on his terms whilemaximizing the exit.EMC is looking to shake Elliot. This is one way to get the shares up and allow EMC to set its own terms, Ray Wang, principal at Constellation Research told TechCrunch.For Dell, Wang says its a play to control the back end of the enterprise and give Dell the ammunition to go head-to-head with Pure Storage (which went public earlier this week), Amazon, Microsoft and others.The problem is that whileit makes sense for Dell to make a stand in storage  it already owns Equallogic  its going to be a hard place to compete. This is compounded by the fact that the price tag is going to be exorbitantly high, and Dell is very likely going to have to leverage itself up to its eyeballs to make this happen. Its a calculated bet, but its a bet nonetheless.Dellcould begin to get a substantial part of its investment back if it sells off VMware and some other pieces outside of storage  and there is a feeling that is what mighthappen. But that begs the question: Why not simply buy the storage pieces? Perhaps EMC is not willing to sell that piece separately andleave the remainder to be scattered to the investment winds.Clearly, VMware is the big prize here, and itwould bea valuableasset for Dell, regardless of whether it holds it or sells.One other thing worth pointing out is that therehas been a succession problem at EMC as Tucci has delayed his retirement a couple of times already. As Primack points out in TermSheet, Michael Dell would make a good candidate to fill that role.When a rumor simply wont go away, theres a good chance theres something to it. We wont know for sure until there is some official announcement, but this deal could let EMC down easy, and give Dell a big foothold in the enterprise.
