Today, Eminem announced that hed be investing in and partnering with lyric-annotation site Genius. Its kind of a match made in heaven, seeing as Eminems lyrics are constantly scrutinized.Heres what Eminem had to say about the tie-up:Coming up we would always obsess over the lyrics from our favorite MCs. Picking everything apart, trying to get into their heads. I still do that today and Genius helps to make it a worldwide conversation. Pretty amazing to me.Dollar amounts were not disclosed, but Eminem will keep annotating his own lyrics on the site and Genius will be the official lyrics engine for Eminem.com and all of Shady Records online properties. Pretty cool.But now to the real news. Alex and Drew will rap-battle the news before your very eyes. Youll get to vote after.Hit play on this sick beat and have a gander:Alex aka DJ FreshlyFinanced:Sometimes people dont get what Im saying,
But how can I fucking be the best when Im slaying,
And these fucking haters are confused about the words coming out,
What do you want, to sit and pout, fuck around like a shit lout?Or you could get your ass to Genius, where shit is tight, live, and hype
Imma sit there and explain my shit to you,
One fucking line at a time,
So if you fuck it up at the show, I know who to fuckin shineand.Drew aka MC AstroCat:Yo, Yo, Yo.
