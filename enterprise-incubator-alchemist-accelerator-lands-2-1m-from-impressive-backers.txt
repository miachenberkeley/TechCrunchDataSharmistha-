Other investors includeDraper Fisher Jurvetson, Foundation Capital, Khosla Ventures, Salesforce.com, SAP Ventures, Siemens and US Venture Partners.Ravi Belani, managing partnerat Alchemist says before his company came along, accelerators tended to be focused on consumer companies. Hecreated this company to give promising enterprise startups a bit of money, access to mentors and some serious training in how to generate sales and raise funds to keep the company going.Danielle DAgostaro, who is a partner and VP of operations at Alchemist says the funding is real validation for the company. The fact that Mayfield  which is one of the oldest, traditional enterprise-focused venture funds  is putting a stake in the ground is intriguing, she wrote in an email.DAgostaro explained there has been debate in the VC community about the viability of accelerators and whether they are a simply a fad orcapable of creating real ventures of lastingvalue. She believes this funding round shows that an incubator focused on enterprise companies can be sustainable.Belani says the new capital legitimizeswhat was originally an experiment. He joked the idea of an enterprise accelerator was thought of as an oxymoron when he first started, but he said he saw entrepreneurs with ideas for enterprise companies, who didnt need a boat load of money. They needed the type of guidance that only VCs tend to provide. He called that his light bulb moment.This really isnt about money either.Participating companies get $30,000 for six months, but they get trainedon customer development, sales and fund raising.
