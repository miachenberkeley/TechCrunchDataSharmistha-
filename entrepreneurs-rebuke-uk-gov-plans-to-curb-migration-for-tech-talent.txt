Plans by the UK government to curtail the number of skilled tech workers allowed into the country have received a stinging rebuke from over 200 of the UKs most successful technology entrepreneurs.The founders of Lastminute.com, TransferWise, Zopa, Unruly, Crowdcube, Nutmeg and Shazam, amongst 230 other tech start-ups and investors, today sent an open letter, to UK Prime Minister David Cameron saying the plans could restrict growth and hurt the UKs digital economy.Included amongst the signatories were Martha Lane Fox, founder of Lastminute.com and the Governments former digital champion; Debbie Wosskow, the chairman of sharing economy body SEUK and a Government adviser; and Hermann Hauser, the founder of Acorn Computers, and tech legend. It also included many prominent backers of Mr. Camerons Conservative Party at the last general electionas well as the founders of Citymapper, DeepMind, SwiftKey and Unruly which has all raised significant VC backing.While net migration levels to the UK have reached new highs, the plans to significantly reduce the number of skilled workers coming to Britain from outside Europe could hurt the UKs ability to hire Europes best talent, says the group of entrepreneurs in the letter which was put together by lobby group Coalition of a Digital Economy.The Governments migration advisory committee is considering plans to raise the minimum salary threshold for the entrepreneur visa (which allows non-Britons to come to the UK to start businesses) so that the visa only applies to director-level roles; as well as putting curbs on the Tier 2 system of skilled work visas, used by many startups to bring in tech talent.The letter stated: The UK has become a global tech hub thanks in large part to start-up founders, investors and employees from across the globe, including many of us who were not born in Britain but choose to invest our time and talents here. We call on [the PM] to ensure that any future changes to the immigration system make it easier, not harder, for qualified digital entrepreneurs to come to the UK to start their business, and for growing start-ups to hire top international talent.According to the Global Skills Index from recruitment group Hays and consultancy Oxford Economics, the skills shortage in Britain worsened for a fourth consecutive year in 2015.Signatories to the letter, organised by Coadec (The Coalition for a Digital Economy), include:Alex Stephany, CEO of JustPark
Andrew Fisher, Executive Chairman of Shazam
Azmat Yusuf, founder of Citymapper
Ben Medlock, co-founder of SwiftKey
Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of DeepMind (acquired by Google)
Hermann Hauser, serial entrepreneur and investor (including founding Acorn Computers, from which ARM was spun out)
Joe Cohen, founder of Seatwave
Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com and former government Digital Champion
Mike Lynch, co-founder of Autonomy (acquired by HP), and founder of Invoke Capital
Nick Hungerford, co-founder of Nutmeg
Robin Klein, investor in startups including TransferWise, Zoopla, LoveFilm
Saul Klein, Founding Partner, LocalGlobe (formerly Partner at Index Ventures)
Sarah Wood, co-founder of Unruly
Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Kaarmann, co-founders of TransferWiseExecutive Director of Coadec, Guy Levin said: The Government has a strong record supporting digital entrepreneurship, so it doesnt make sense that are considering changes that would make it tougher for startups and scale-ups to thrive. Any changes to the immigration system must make it easier, not harder, for digital entrepreneurs to come to the UK to start their business, and for growing startups to hire top international talent.Commenting, Alex Depledge, co-founder of Hassle.com and Chair of Coadec said: A lack of people with the right skills and experience is holding back the growth of the UKs digital economy. Putting coding on the curriculum and investing in apprenticeships are steps in the right direction, but it is also vital that we are attracting the best talent from around the world. The UK is now home to a world-class startup ecosystem, but if we want those companies to scale, they need to be able to hire the best person for the job, wherever they come from.Sarah Wood, co-founder and co-CEO of Unruly, said: As a global platform for digital video advertising, almost two-thirds of Unrulys revenue comes from outside the UK. We simply could not have scaled the business to the size it is today (15 offices, 28.7m revenue) without the programming expertise and language skills of international software engineers and digital professionals from around the world. If the Government is serious about growing Britains digital economy and competing on a global stage, it cannot afford to cut off the oxygen that feeds our ecosystem  skilled talent from around the world, drawn to London and the UK precisely because of its diversity, creativity and vitality.Text of the Letter and Signatories27 October 2015Dear Prime Minister,We represent a cross-section of the UKs digital startup and scale-up ecosystem, including the founders of Citymapper, DeepMind, JustPark and SwiftKey. The UK has the largest and fastest growing digital economy in the G20, worth over 10% of GDP.During the election campaign you argued that the UK should be the startup nation in Europe, and one of the great startup nations in the world. We share this ambition and applaud your governments long-standing support for the UKs tech community. From SEIS to support for FinTech and the sharing economy, you have championed entrepreneurs and innovators in the interest of securing our countrys long-term economic growth.However, finding talent with the right skills and experience we need to grow our businesses remains one of the biggest barriers to achieving that ambition. The UK has become a global tech hub thanks in large part to startup founders, investors and employees from across the globe, including many of us who were not born in Britain but choose to invest our time and talents here. We are very concerned that changes to immigration policy will make it more difficult to attract and recruit the talent high-growth companies need to compete and succeed in a global marketplace.The governments Migration Advisory Committee is currently examining proposals aiming to further restrict the Tier 2 system of skilled work visas and to reform the Entrepreneur Visa. Further restrictions on skilled migration could restrict the growth of our businesses and hurt the UKs digital economy.We call on you to ensure that any future changes to the immigration system make it easier, not harder, for qualified digital entrepreneurs to come to the UK to start their business, and for growing startups to hire top international talent.It is of course also vital that we continue to support the growth of digital skills within the UK, and we stand ready to do our part.Sincerely yours,Adam Horner
