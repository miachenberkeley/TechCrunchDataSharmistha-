Amazon may have made waves earlier this month with news that it would now allow users to watch Prime Instant Video titles while offline, but now othervideoservice providersare beginning to follow suit. The latest to introduce offline viewing on mobile devices is EPIX, the premium cable channel thats ajoint venture between Viacom, Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate, and MGM.The soon-to-launch feature will work on a wide range of mobile devices, the company says, including iPhone, iPad, Android mobile phones and tablets, and Kindle Fire devices. However, unlike with Amazons implementation, EPIXs offline movie viewing is not something available to over-the-topsubscribers, but is rather an addition to EPIXs current set ofTV Everywhere-enabled apps.EPIX app users will need to have a cable or satellite subscription from a companylike AT&T U-verse, Bright House Networks, Cox, Dish, Time Warner, Verizon FiOS or others, in order to take advantage of the ability to download movies for offline viewing. The network notes itwill also launch a marketing campaign with its affiliated distributors later this month to tout the new offering.However, because this is a feature only available to pay TV subscribers, thatmakes it less compelling than Amazon Instant Videos new offline support, which better appeals to the cord-cutting crowd. But at the very least, its an acknowledgementthat offering on-demand video is only part of the solution  many consumers will still want and need a way to watch videos when an internet connection is not available.EPIXs move into offline movies followslast months news that Netflixended its partnership with the channel. Thatmeans Netflix on October 1st will lose a number of high-profile titles, including films likeHunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z and Transformers: Age of Extinction,for example.Now these movies and others like those from the James Bond and Star Trek franchises will be available on EPIXs app, alongside its original documentaries, music and comedy events featuring Katy Perry, Craig Ferguson, Louis CK, Mark Maron and others.Netflix, for what its worth, has notably stated that it will not offering offline viewing, saying that the feature would add complexity and may not be broadly adopted, despite consumer demands. Thats a reasonable enough decision, but one that reflects a more optimistic view of an internet-connected future rather than the realities of the world we live in today.With spotty cellular coverage and slow public Wi-Fi networks, there are plenty of places where its technically possible, but, in practice, very frustrating to try to watch streaming video on mobile devices. You can probably list a good handful of everyday spots where youve tried and failed to get a good stream going.The EPIX app today offers thousands of titles for streaming. Beginninglater this month, theyll be available fordownload, too.Though competing premium networks have beaten EPIX to launch over-the-top services, EPIX notes it was the first to offer its content across multiple platforms and now is the first to offer offline viewing. In addition to mobile devices, EPIX also has apps for Xbox, PlayStation, Roku and works with Chromecast and Android TV.
