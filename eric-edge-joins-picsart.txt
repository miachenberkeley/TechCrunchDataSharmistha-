PicsArt is announcing that it has hired Eric Edge as its vice president of marketing.Edge spent the last four-plus years at Facebook (where he led the companys marketing efforts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa), then at Facebook-owned Instagram (where he worked on brand strategy). He told me he hadnt been planningto leave, but when he learned about PicsArt, he thought it was pushing into the future and saw an opportunity to build something new.At first glance, you might think PicsArt sounds like a direct competitor to Instagram  in fact, Edge said he was just as guilty of this as anyone else.After taking a closer look, however, he argued that theyre fundamentally different. Where Instagram allows people use photos to share moments in their lives, Edge said PicsArt is more about collaborative content creation. After all, PicsArt users can post their photo with a #freetoedit hashtag and see what the rest of the community does with it.By hiring Edge (who has also worked as global communications officer at ad agency Havas Worldwide), PicsArt seems to be signaling its intentionto bring more brands and marketers into the app. Edge said thats a fair characterization, adding that thus far, the company has been focused on buildingthe community: At some point, I think theres a huge opportunity for brands to be part of the things we do.This is a companythats really started to gain traction in the market, Edgesaid. Now it needs someone to come in and help build the business. Im wired for that.
