The European Union has launched a public consultationon rules governing the use of personal telecoms data. The so-called ePrivacy Directive also coversthe use of tracking cookies by online servicesThe digitaltracking landscape has expanded considerably in the years since the ePrivacy regulations were shaped, as companies use of marketing technologies hasproliferated to collate and triangulate increasing amounts ofuser data  providing one clear impetus for regulators to revisit and update privacyrules to try to keep pace.Indeed, the most recent addition to the ePrivacy Directive (pertaining to cookies) is still more than five years old, havingbeen addedback in 2009.So-called over the top (OTT) messaging apps and VoIP applications  such as WhatsApp and Skype  are also not currently bound by the directivebut telecoms companies would of course prefer theywere, given the widespread adoptionof OTTcomms services. Albeit, telcos complainingabout being overly regulated vs their Internet company counterparts is a perennial refrain.The ePrivacy directive is a supplement to Europesincoming generaldata protection rules (GDPR), finally agreed by MEPs at the back end of last year  and just today voted through the LIBE committee. A final vote on the GDPR will take place this Thursday, with theregulation set to come into force in 2018. So another impetus to update the ePrivacy Directive is to harmonize it with the new GDPR.#dataprotection regulation adopted by @EP_Justice 50/3/1 @JanAlbrecht. Vote by #EPlenary on Thursday LIBE Committee Press (@EP_Justice) April 12, 2016European politicians decided to separate the two legislative pieces in order to reduce the complexityof overhauling thegeneraldirective. Now the latterhas been achieved theyre turning their attention to the ePrivacy piece  with a plan to propose a new version of that by the end of this year.The Commission wants to reassess the scope of the Directive to ensure citizens the same level of protection online and offline, the EU notes in a update on its plans, adding that the aim is to fashion rules that are up to date with the challenges of the digital era.It says the public consultation is aimedat gathering views on the effectiveness, relevance and coherence of current rules as well as the options for revising the text.As part of that discussion process its running a workshop today in Brussels with various stakeholders, including national data protection authorities and mobile operators. Issues slated fordiscussed at this event include:And judging by relatedchatter on Twitter, some of those stakeholders  includingconsumer rights groups and the Frenchdata protection authority arearguingfor browsers to have do-not-track technology pre-installed and default switched on, in order to safeguard user data in an era of ever more sophisticated tracking tech. Rather than relying on pro-active and informed users to know to opt out of being tracked.Solutions on the browser level are important, Dot Not Track (developed by @csoghoian ) raised here by Gwendal Legrand CNIL, #ePrivacy Pinkeee (@Elinor_Carmi) April 12, 2016Another area the EU is concerned to address via anupdated ePrivacy directive is what it dubsinconsistent enforcement and fragmentation at national level.This is perhaps most obvious in how the rules have played out across the region vis-a-vis cookies, with Internetusers in Europe encounteringa variety of cookie consent banners when they visit websites and apps  which arguably do little to help the cause of user data protection, and rather more toirritate consumers with annoying pop-up messages. So the risks of badly thought through rulesareamply clear.However irritating consent messages pale into insignificance beside the massiverisks posed totelco users privacy by the spreadof tracking technologiesand big data processing techniques in recent years.Marketing technology tools evolution since 2011 https://t.co/7V6M1Et7gm #MarTech #ePrivacy pic.twitter.com/VWDsxdAj7c Aurelie Pols (@AureliePols) April 12, 2016Arecent report by digital rights group, the Open Rights Group, looked at the practices of the UKs four major carriers and the risks to user data. Its report argued that the UK telcos are, at best, doing the bare minimum to comply with current data protection law in this area  including asserting that customers are not being given enough clear information about how their data is being used; nor are they being given clear and easy ways to opt-out of their data being used; and that telcosare not always properly anonymizing traffic and location data which means they should in factgain consent for use of that data.The current law may not be fit for purpose in giving customers control over the risks associated with Big Data, the report added in one of its conclusions.Meanwhile, over in the US, the FCC has just this month proposed new privacy rulesforISPs that would, if adopted, require broadband providersto gain explicit consent from users for using or sharing their data, with some narrow exceptions, such as for providing and marketing the specific service. The FCC is currently consulting on its plans to set new rules.The EUs public consultation on the ePrivacy Directive will run until July 5.
