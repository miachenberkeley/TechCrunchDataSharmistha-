Along running reform of European data protection legislation which kicked off in 2012 has passed a big milestone today; ministers in the European Council have ostensibly agreed on ageneral approach  allowing for the debate to move to the next stageand the potential forreform negotiations to be wrapped up by the end of the year.The European Commission said todaythat trialogue negotiations with the Parliament and the Council will start this month  with a shared ambition ofreaching a final agreement by the end of 2015.The European Parliament gave its backing toproposed new data protection rulesback in March 2014. However the agreement reached by the Council introducesplenty ofamendments and rewrites to those earlier proposals. (The full text endorsed by ministers can be found here.)The EC states that todays general approach includes agreement from EU justice ministers on areas such as:But claims of a big step forward in agreeing modernizing EU data protection ruleslooks rather like political spinon the part of the Commission  judging bythe number of carve outs forhow member states can enact the legislation, based on the Councils amendments to the proposals.In other words, there looks to be so much dilution afforded by allowing member states flexibility that both regulatory consistency and privacy protections have beensignificantly eroded in order to achieveagreement among ministers.As one data protection training company,Amberhawk,notes in a blog (referencingleaked versionsof the Councils text):In summary, there are 35 flexible provisions to be implemented by 26 Member States in their own way; this can result in 26 separate data protection laws which could have significant differences in 35 Articles The Commissions objective of obtaining a consistent data protection approach has comprehensively failed.Digital rights organization Accesshas also criticizedthe Councils text for includingso many loopholes its not even consistent with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.It writes:In particular, the Councils text would allow companies to collect and repeatedly use citizens personal information without their knowledge (Article 6.4). It would also enable companies to transfer this personal data to countries that do not have rules or a mechanism in place to ensure the protection of this data (Article 38). Simply put, under the Council text, it would be impossible for anyone to know what is happening to their personal data or who has access to it.This follows earlierconcerns from European digital rights association, the EDRi (which counts Access as a member),back in March again based on leaked documents  thatprivacy protections within the data protection reforms were being systematically eroded.So EU ministers agreeing to disagree on data protection reform seems a fairer summary of todays big step forward.Whateverdevils lurk in the details  the Councilsfull text runs to 200-pages; a spokesman was unable to specify how many amendments had been made, saying I dont know its a long regulation!!  todays developments are not the final step in the reform process.Next up, starting on June 24, will be the firsttrialogue meeting between the European Council, Commission and Parliament for furtherdiscussions. Allhave to agreebefore a new directive can be enacted so there are months ofnegotiations to go before Europe gets a new data protection directive.And if the discrepancy between what MEPs agreedand what the Council of ministers prefersis as large as it appearsthen those negotiations are going to have some sizable sticking points.Closing remarks by Commissioner Jourova: "I have noted all the remaining concerns. We also have concerns, but let's move forward." #EudataP Ralf Bendrath (@bendrath) June 15, 2015Okay, so @EUCouncil agreed on the #EUdataP text, with tons of disagreement..
