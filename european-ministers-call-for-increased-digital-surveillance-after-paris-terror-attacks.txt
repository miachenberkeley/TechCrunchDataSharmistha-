And so it begins again; the customary fingerpointing at the Internet as a platform for fueling extremist hatred in the wake of the latest terrorist outrages in Europe accompanied,in certaincornersof the political arena, by calls forgreater powers of digital surveillance to preemptively thwart acts ofterror.In a joint statement put out yesterday, the justice and interior ministers of 12 European countries  including the U.K., France and Germany  express concern at theincreasingly frequent use of the Internet to fuel hatred andviolence and signal our determination to ensure that the Internet is not abused to this end.They alsocall for major ISPs to partner with governments to enable swift reporting of materialthat aims to incite hatred and terror and the condition of its removing, whereappropriate/possible.The statementechoes moves by the U.K. governmentlate last year to co-opt major ISPs (and their users) into doing more to help combat extremistmaterial posted online with a plan tointroduce stricter filters and improvedreporting mechanisms, including havingISPshosta public reporting button for extremist content.The U.K. government wasalso, late last year, laying out a plan to useIP-matchingas a counter-terrorism measure  to better identify individual web users who might be posting or consuming problem content.The joint European ministers statement steers away from detailing any suchspecific technological measures, but talks up the need for generally strengthening operational cooperation and intelligence sharing across Europe  such as in areas of pan-European travel and illegal firearms control  as well as ramping up intelligence sharing withtheU.S. and Canada in order to, as they put it, defend the valuesof peace and tolerance around the globe.The statement alsocommits to European governments waging a collective counter-extremist propaganda war online bydeveloping positive, targeted and easily accessiblemessages; able to counter [terrorist]propaganda, aimed at a young audience that is particularlyvulnerable to indoctrination.Our action must continue to be part of a comprehensive approach, based on the fight against radicalization, notably on the Internet, and on the strengthening of resources to thwart the action of the different forms of terrorist networks and notably to hamper their movement, the statement adds.The Internet being in the firing line, post-terrorist outrage, is par for the course. Politicians go-toresponse to terrorism is to talk tough on something  and with no easy physical target to attack,digital channels become the obviousstand in.No one who has to regularly stand for election wants to soundsoft-touch withthe smell of gunfire lingering in the air. And given the dispersed, decentralized nature of modern terrorism the majorityofits battles are fought online  as part of an ongoing propaganda war between conflicting ideologies.That in turnsmeansthe Internet becomes embroiled in and implicated in the struggle, asthe virtual battlefieldwhere propaganda skirmishes play out. And where, we are continually told, terrorists are recruitedand trained. (Western politicians obviously dont want to finger their own foreign policies as contributory factors to any growth in extremism.)And so we see our politicians once again worrying in public about the Internet and even hankering for greater powers to intercept everyones digital communications taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut approach in order to appear appropriately tough in the wake of last weeks horrifying slaughter in Paris.This weekend, U.K. Prime Minister, David Cameron, told ITV News: We do need to modernise our rules about interception in order to tackle what he dubbed the poisonous death cult of extremist Islam. Hewent on to commit to (re)introduce legislation to enable a more comprehensive interception of web users communications should he be re-elected in the U.K. General Election, this May.Aso-called Snoopers Charter requiring blanket retention of digital comms has failed to make it onto the U.K.s statute books multiple times in recent years, including last year when the coalition governments junior partner baulked at supporting the more expansive interception powers contained within theCommunications Data Bill  on the grounds of it being a disproportionate invasion of civil liberties andprivacy.However theConservative Party, which leads the current coalition,has been ramping up its digital counter-terrorism rhetoric for some time now. In November, for instance, it waspointing the finger of blame at Facebook for not doing more to prevent the2013 killing of a soldier in London by two extremists,arguing that the social network should have identified and informedonspecific terrorist chatter taking place via its website. Instead of directingblame at the security services for multiple intelligence failures associated with the extremistperpetrators of that act of terrorism.Bottom line: Its a lot easier for governments to spread blame outwards, extending responsibility for countering terrorism beyond theirown boundaries ontoan amorphous and dangerous Internet. That also createsa parallel impetus for them to increase surveillance of anow perilously implicatedInternet.And so we get to the latestcalls for increased surveillance, post-Paris terrorist atrocity. Scapegoating and surveillance are the watchwords of modern counterterrorism policy, and the Internet is its apparent applicationlayer.The particular irony here (and not the only one) is that last weeks terrorist atrocities in Paris were, at least in part,a direct attack on freedom of expression  given that onetarget was a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, which had published cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad.(For the record, other targets ofCharlies penover the years included non-Islam-related entitiessuch as the Catholic Church, and the leader of Frances Far Right party, Marine Le Pen.)That means that political kneejerkery urgingInternet clampdowns here, perhaps has to be a little more sensitively crafted than usual  given the potential for self-generated satire. Hence asecondary clause inserted into the European ministers joint statement whichlabours a point aboutsafeguarding that [the Internet] remains, in scrupulous observance of fundamental freedoms, aforum for free expression, in full respect of the law.But even herethis united front ofpoliticiansismaking sure to pointout thatthe fundamental freedoms of free expression on the Internet arealready bounded by the law.In other words freedom of expression is always relative to the values of the society doing the policing. The problem withthe Internet, of course, is ithasglobal reach, andno single law applies. So there is even more relativity than usual.The Internet can be characterized as a platform that enablesthe very extremes offreedom of expression, given its growing global reach and lowered barriers to publishing and to buildingan audience  not to mention thechallenges of policing cyberspace  enabling all sorts of content to proliferate, permeate and resonate. Content that, in earlier times, would never have achieved such amplification or support, given that it would have beenfiltered or edited out of more tightly controlled publishing media before it was able to do so.Its therefore a platform that is increasingly creating uncomfortable ideological juxtapositions as the adoption of digital tools ramps up across the globe,and different groups and communitieslearn how to broadcast their messages toa global audience. Polarizedviewpoints arecoming into contact like never before. And we are seeing an emergentculture of conflicton mainstream online channels.Howpoliticians respond to this increasing visibility of conflict online  and to the terrorist outrages that they (mis)characterize as outgrowths of digitalactivity will shape the future of the Internet. This is a complex, geo-political challenge being played out on a digital platform still dominated in large part by U.S. companies and U.S.-led governance entities.Combating extremist propaganda online with targeted positive messages certainly sounds like a more proportionatecounter terrorism strategy than putting allcitizensdigital communications undersurveillance. But, as Edward Snowdenhas shown us, online surveillance dragnetshave beenthe story of apost-9/11 world.So here at the start of 2015 lets hope politicians think carefully before they pull the policy trigger.
