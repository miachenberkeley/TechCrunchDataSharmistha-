If you were under the impression that a new data transfer agreement had been locked downbetween Europe and the US  to restore legalconfidencein commercial data flowsacross the Atlantic  think again.While the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield was announced by the European Commission back in February,after multiple years of negotiations between the EU and the US to agree a replacement data transfer mechanism,the details of the draft deal have since been being scrutinized by thenational data protection authorities  who have yet to give ittheir blessing.And while the WP29s opinion on the Privacy Shield is not legally binding, a thumbs down from increasingly powerful national DPAs could fatally dent confidence in the agreement, leaving businesses to be saddledwith legal uncertainty about how they can moveEuropean data to the USfor processing. And the whole impetus behind thePrivacy Shield is to offer confidence and certainty, replacing the now defunct Safe Harbor agreement  which lasted for some fifteen years and was being used by ~4,000 companies prior to being struck down last fall. So what the WP29 thinks herereally matters.This group of national privacy watchdogs, badged withawkward umbrella moniker theArticle 29 Working Party (WP29), has today given what they say is their final assessment on the Privacy Shield and that assessment is that, inits current form, the agreement is not clear orrobustenough to gain their support. More work needs to be done to clarify portions of the agreement, said the CNIL French DPAs Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, although she also describedthe deal asa major improvement and greatstep forward over the prior Safe Harboragreement.Givinga press conference today, Falque-Pierrotin said themainconcerns ofthe WP29 vis-a-vis Privacy Shield are the continued potential for European citizens data to be harvested in bulk via US mass surveillance programs, and the independence of an ombudsperson who would be appointed in the US to assess data-related complaints from European citizens.Its a bit too early to come to a conclusion, she told journalists, discussing the WP29s position on the Privacy Shield. We are waiting for the Commission to give its final word and once the final word is said, and once we have this final word, the last decision of the European court, all these elements, if needed well be in a position to take decisions or to express, maybe, another position. But this is another step. Were not [yet]there.The negotiations on the Shield are not finished. It is a dynamic and we are in a position to bring propositions to this dynamic and we hope we will be heard, she added. The question that is behind our concerns is the legal robustness of the Shield.The original Safe Harbor data transfer deal was struck down by Europes top court back in October 2015, following a legal challengebrought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems on the grounds that US government mass surveillance programs were violating Europeans fundamental privacy rights. The court agreed with the challenge, invalidating Safe Harbor and leaving companies that had been relying on itto govern EU-US data transfersto fall back on alternative mechanisms, such as binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses.The WP29 today said thosealternative transfer mechanisms could still continue to be used by businesseswhile the uncertainty around a new overarching EU-US data transfer mechanism continues albeit the legality of those mechanisms has also been questioned, on the same grounds of whether or not they provide an elusive essential equivalence level of protection for Europeans data once it is in the US.The Privacy Shield provides for a swathe of exceptions whereby US can perform bulk collection (or generalized access, as it was euphemistically referred to by the EC commissioner leading the negotiations to secure a new deal) of European data such as wheretailored and targeted access is not technically or operationally possible; or if they see some verydangerous trend that needs more than targeted access  and these exceptions are evidentlytoo broad for the WP29 to be confident the Privacy Shield would stand up to afuture legal challenge. Schrems himself has alsopreviously expressed the same concern.Earlier this month leaks from the German DPAs suggested the WP29 was not happy with the shape of the current deal. The clear risk, then, is for national DPAs tosupport future challenges to the deal leading to continueduncertainty about the legal status of EU-US data transfers. Which is pretty much where things stand now. National DPAs also have the power to suspend particular data transfers posing a clear operational risk to, for example, cloudbusinesses that rely on being able to upload and process user data onservers located in the US.Also today the WP29 said it wants the Privacy Shield to be reviewed in two years time, when a new general data protection regulation  the GDPR  is due to come into force. The new directive tightens Europesdata protection rules, and includes stiffer penalties for companies breaching the rules.Meanwhile, the timetable for a final EC decision onthe Privacy Shield  assuming the Commissioncarries on pushing ahead with the agreement is slated for mid-June. Individual European Union member states will alsoneed to agree the mechanism.Commenting following the WP29s press conference, Schrems said the groupsdownbeat assessment of the draft agreementmakes a legal challenge to Privacy Shield more likely to succeed.I personally doubt that the European Commission will change its plans much. There will be some political wording, but I think they will still push it through. Given the negative opinion, a challenge to the Privacy Shield at the Courts is even more promising. Privacy Shield is a total failure, that is kept alive because of extensive pressure by the US government and some sectors of the industry, he said.Update:The WP29 has now publishedits statement on the draft agreement, setting outs its concerns in detail  includingcommercial concerns thatdata protection principles set out within the agreement still fall short of European standards, and that redress mechanisms for European citizens are too complex, along withadditional concerns focused onpublic authorities access to transferred data.On the latter point it flags itslongstanding position that massive and indiscriminate surveillance of individuals can never be considered as proportionate and strictly necessary in a democratic society, as is required under the protection offered by the applicable fundamental rights, adding:The WP29 takes note that there is a tendency to collect ever more data on a massive and indiscriminate scale in the light of the fight against terrorism. Given the concerns this brings for the protection of the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection, the WP29 looks to the forthcoming rulings of the CJEU in cases regarding massive and indiscriminate data collection.
