London-based VC firm Octopus Ventures has topped up its evergreen early stage startup investment fund with another 100 million, bringing the total backing the fund to more than 400 million. It says it plans to invest more than 75 million in early stage startups this year.Octopus does around 10 to 12 new investments per year, viathis fund  in addition to follow on funding in its existing portfolio of more than50 companies. Itcan investbetween 250,000 and25 million in a first round of funding.About 25 per cent of the money we invest will go into new investments and about 75 per cent will go into follow-on investments,says Alex Macpherson, who heads up the firm.For example, in the past year, Octopusmade 36 rounds of financing  of which 10 were new investments. Its portfolio spansa wide range of tech areas, playing in bothb2b and b2c markets, and includes businesses building marketplaces (e.g. Yplanand Secret Escapes), hardware (such as AR firmWaveoptics)and digital health tech.Predictive keyboard maker SwiftKey, which exited to Microsoft earlier this yearfor $250M, was another Octopus investment.Around two-thirds of its investments arein UK-based companies, withLondon an obvious focal point, whilethe other third are sourcedfrom elsewhere in Europe  withOctopus taking a particular interest in other city startup hubs, such as Berlin, Stockholm, Paris and Lisbon, according toMacpherson.Hes bullish on the opportunities for entrepreneurs in the European ecosystem at this point  as well he must be, given the firms investment focus  arguing that despite a tougher investment climate for startups over in the U.S., wherestartup valuations have beenlosing some of their unicorn-y sheen of late, here in Europe things havealways had to bea bit more realistic.Businesses are backed in order to become self-sustaining businesses, and whilst in the US weve seen probably a slowdown  or certainly a reappraisal of the investment rate, over the last few months by the VCs, and thats partly been because of the amount of money the companies are burning and theyre considering what they need to do with those businesses  here, for us, its all about building sustainable businesses that are able to take advantage of the situation, he tells TechCrunch.Similarly I dont think the UK and Europe has seen the same growth in valuation that you saw in the US, not the same heady heights, and thats also why you see some of the US investors, at the later stage, coming over to make investments in Europe. So I think its a really exciting time for the UK and Europe. I also think theres a big opportunity as we go forward. And theres probably a greater amount of capital across the spectrum So Im pretty bullish about the UK and European scene over the next three to five year time period.US investors and potentially even some Asian investors are actually recognizing this growth of European entrepreneurs and who are also starting to look at this area  and that provides even greater opportunity for those businesses to have the funding as they go forward, and to build truly industry changing companies, he adds.Octopusfund sits somewhere in the middlein terms of European investors  dwarfed by the likes of Accel, Index and Balderton but often also investing alongside those larger VCs. Itdoes also invest in European startups at a later stage in their business cycle, in growth rounds  so from Series B/C and up  viathe$140M Octopus Opportunities Fund itannounced last year.WhileMacpherson is generallyupbeaton theregional investment climate he stressesthat European entrepreneurs should still be laserfocused onbuildingself-sustaining businesses  with sensible and realistic valuations, and a focus on generating revenue even early on.The cheapestform of equity for companies is the sales they make so that it reduced the amount of money theyre burning so sales are pretty key, he notes.How should Europeanentrepreneurs be strategizing for the currentinvestment climate? The sensible thing that those entrepreneurs will do is theyll say how do I spend the time and look at whats the amount of money Im taking, and how longdoes that money last me? says Macpherson.Similarly entrepreneurs will look at saying the most important thing is having that cash liquidity so if they have very lofty valuation ideas then that may causecertain investors concern because they dont see how the further rounds of funding are likely to come at higher valuations. And this is why I think the UK and Europe is well placed because I dont think weve seen that sort of runaway to the same extent that it may have done in the US.So the way in which entrepreneurs approach this is to say lets be sensible about this, what makes sense to us is to build sustainable businesses, therefore we can do this with X amount of money at Y valuation, which suits us, which suits the investors, and thats the aspect in order to take those businesses forward.
