Munich-based Tado, maker of smart thermostat and AC control products, has raised another $23 million for further international expansion. The new investment is led by Inven Capital, the venture capital arm of the ez Group, a multinational energy conglomerate based in the Czech Republic. Its the startups third funding round and brings the total raised to $57 million since being founded in 2011.Tados previous backers include the venture capital unit of Siemens AG, and Statkraft Venture Capital, the investment company of Europes largest producer of renewable energy. In addition, Target Partners, Shortcut Ventures and BayBG are also investors.The companys two current products are a smart thermostat  resulting in Tado sometimes being called the Nest of Europe  and a smart AC controller. Both enable a homes heating/cooling to be controlled via the Tado smartphone app, with a flagship geo-location feature that means Tado is able to know when you have left home or are returning and adjusts your heating or air conditioning accordingly.This, co-founder and CEO ChristianDeilmann argues, is better than a purely self-learning approach, such as that utilised by Nest, or relying on schedules alone, however much easier they are to program using a modern smartphone app.In a call yesterday, he said that Tados location-based automation is still the main feature that provides differentiation from competitors at the point of sale in retail stores, such as Dixons Group in the U.K., where the Tado will often be sitting alongside products from Google-owned Nest or British Gas Hive. He also says 87 per cent of all Tado users take advantage of the geo-fencing functionality to automatically control their homes climate.But actually Tado is a much deeper tech play than smartphone and location-based control of your homes heating and cooling systems alone. The startups smart thermostat has been painstakingly engineered to be able to connect to a boilers digital serial interface, more typically found in heating systems in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and in newer systems in general, which enables the cloud service to be able to do all sorts of other clever things.This includes the ability to modulate heating, rather than simple switching the boiler on or off, as well as monitor the health of a houses heating system remotely, sending diagnostics to a maintenance company or engineer. The former offers much greater energy efficiency, says Deilmann, while the latter can help prevent a boiler from failing outright because problems can be more easily caught in time.Tado currently offers its diagnostics portal to partner installers and services companies as a way to build long term value into those relationships. However, in future it could monetize that aspect of its offering via, for example, a marketplace for parts or by providing a library of technical information in the cloud.Then theres the way Tado is planning to make its service smarter for the benefit of energy management overall, including at the national grid level. In practice this means partnerships with local utilities companies  and is perhaps where the startups strategic investors come even more into focus  to enable Tado and its customers to opt into demand response schemes so that a homes heating and cooling systems are utilised where possible outside of known peak energy times.This could be a simple as turning your heating down by a few points without it really being noticeable or heating your home up a little ahead of time. In aggregate, this can make a tangible difference to the national grids ability to stabilize energy consumption and production, and, says Deilmann, is where the bigger picture of smart home climate control really kicks in.
