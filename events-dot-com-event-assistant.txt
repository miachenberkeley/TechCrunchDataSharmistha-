Launching today, it isdesigned to help organizers of events big and smallkeep some semblance of sanity as the crazy world of event management rages around them.Its simple, but simple is the best policywhen you have a queue of eager fans waiting.For something that sounds as un-sexy as event management, the Events.com team hasdone a cracking job at making it as easy as possible, cramming a ton of clever features into the app; it offers event check-in with voice recognition, keeps the check-ins synced across devices to ensure guests can only use each ticket once and real-time synchronization for new and cancelled registrations.The app also tackles a couple of less obvious challenges with event registrations, such as e-signing of waivers such as legal disclaimers, film / photography releases and terms and conditions. The app also packs in an offline mode, so your event doesnt come crashing down to a smoldering pile of disappointment if the Wi-Fi network takes a stage-dive into the concrete floor and sinks into unconsciousness for a few minutes.The Event Assistant App is the perfect partner to the Events.com online event management platform. The app provides organizers and volunteers with the tools to effortlessly keep lines moving on event day, said Tressa Schultze, Product Manager at Events.com.The app is only available for Android for now,citing the availability ofaffordableAndroid devices and an advantage in speed-to-market. The company didnt rule out an iOS version in the future, but doesnt appear to be making it a priority for now.
