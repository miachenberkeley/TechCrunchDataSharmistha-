Some more news fromEvernote  the note-taking app and startup of the same name  that speaks to the companys currentrough patch: today it announced that as of Wednesday at 6pm Pacific, it will shutterMarket, thee-commerce platform where itsold Evernote swag and Evernote-integrated office products, in an attempt to create another revenue stream around its more dedicated users.Separately, weve also learned that there is another senior departure at the company: Ronda Scott, the companys longtime head of comms, is leaving at the end of this week.The moves come at what has beena prettydifficult period for the startup. Developments have included a number of senior departures, including that of the previous, longtime CEO Phil Libin; other underperforming products getting axed, and the startup  once commanding a $1 billiontagamong several whose valuations have more recently been marked down by large fund managers.In a blog post announcing the news today, head of partnerships John Hoye wrotethat the move is being made as part of Evernotes restructuring around its core business as a software  not e-commerce  company.Evernote is a software company. Building and perfecting the Evernote experience is where well be focusing our future efforts. Instead of selling and fulfilling orders ourselves, on February 3rd, we will transition the Market to promote Evernote-integrated products made and sold by our partners at Adonit, Moleskine, and PFU, he said. We plan to continue adding partners and integrations that strongly and elegantly complement Evernote to that list.Remaining products will be shown off in the form of links, which will redirect users to other sites in order to purchase them, a spokesperson confirmed.Evernote the app has been working for years on building its service around a freemium model  with a basic version of the app available for free on the premise that it would be so useful that enough peoplewould be willing to pay extra for the paid/premium tiers that provided more storage and more functionality.Its former CEO Libin was a big fan also of touting the companys longevity: in his view (and the companys up to now), Evernote was a place to store everything for your lifetime and beyond. The company says it has over150 million users globally but does not break out how many of them are paying for the service.Putting to one sidequestions of whether Evernote (or its users) may need to reconsider at some point the infinite nature of the service, just looking atthe app itself, the Market was a curious concept.Evernote is astartup based aroundkeeping documents in the cloud  and eliminating the need for paper. So whenthe Market and its focus on notebooksand other products was introduced in 2013, it did feel a little out of left field.Libin at the time justified the move of peddling products like Moleskine notebooks but also post-its as a way of expanding the Evernote experience in a good way (never mind the Evernote themed socks, I guess):Paperless is not the goal  great experience is not the goal. Libin said. We want to eliminate the stupid uses of paper, but we want to extend the great uses. A year after that the company said it had sold some $12 million in goods through the store. And today it updated that with other numbers: over800,000 Evernote Moleskine notebooks, 300,000 Jot Script styluses and nearly20,000 ScanSnap Evernote Edition scanners.But at the end of the day, it seemsthose numbers did not really meet thecosts of maintaining the operation. So nowthatEvernote is calling time on all frivolities; trying to get back to the heart of what made the startup so popularin the first place; and driving more premium users  which are up 40% on a year ago, a spokesperson tells me the decision to shutthe Market was probably an easy sell at the startup.
