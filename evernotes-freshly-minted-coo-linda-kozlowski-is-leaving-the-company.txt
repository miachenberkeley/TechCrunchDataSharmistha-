Evernotemade a name for itself as the platform where you couldstore your ideas and notes for life, and beyond. But the same permanence does not apply to the people who work there.Weve confirmed through multiple sources that Linda Kozlowski,Evernotes COO, has put in her notice and will be leaving the company by the end of this year.Its the latest in a series of recent twists and turns at the popular startup: thisyear has seen Evernoteappointa new CEO, facelayoffs, closeoffices, and kill off products.Its not clear whyKozlowski is going, but its notable for its abruptness: Kozlowskihas been with Evernote for just over three years, but only took up the COO role this past summer.Its also notable when tracking what else might follow.Watchfordepartures of at least four more executives in the months to come, our sources say.Kozlowskisdeparture after such a short time in the role underscores the upheaval at Evernote at the moment.Evernote, founded in 2007, counts over 100 million users of its note-taking and organizational mobile and desktop apps, and it has raised some $290 million in funding from investors like Sequoia, Morgenthaler and (most recently) Japans financial media giant Nikkei.But more recently, the company seems to be in disarray. It hasbeen slammed for having a lack of product focus  rolling out and closing a variety of vertical apps and services, putting resources intoaphysical goods market when the core product is an app. And its been criticised for failing to convert enough users from free to paying tiers.Its also not asurprise to see execsleave, considering that many of the senior staff at the company date from when Phil Libin was running the show. (While Libin remains as executive chairman, hes also now a partner at General Catalyst so is not in the mix day to day as ONeill is.)Kozlowski has been a key person in Evernotes growth both into new markets as well as into new business areas, as pointed out by Libin when he blogged about her appointment:During her tenure, Linda has worked tirelessly to bring Evernote to individuals and teams around the world. As VP of Worldwide Operations, she ran all of Evernotes global initiatives and oversaw the expansion of Evernote into China and Brazil. More recently, Linda directed Evernotes global pricing strategy, which culminated in the successful launch of the new Evernote Plus and Evernote Premium tiers.All important milestones for Evernote, for sure. But as the startupcontinues, in the words of ONeill, its focus on growth and expansion for tomorrow, users and Evernotesstaff itself will probably be wondering what furtherchanges will happen today.Evernote and Kozlowski did not respond to requests for comment.
