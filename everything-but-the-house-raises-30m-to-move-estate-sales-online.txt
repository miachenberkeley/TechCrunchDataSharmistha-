But for the seller we mitigate that risk because certain things sell way above their market value due to the very competitive bidding experience.Nielsen says that the most expensive item ever sold on the site is a 2004 Boston Red Sox World Series ring that went for $89,000, although hes also seenitems sell for as low as five bucks.Launched in Cincinnati in 2008, EBTH hassetup shop in Los Angeles, D.C., Dallas, and five other metro areas over the last eight months. Nielsen says the company will open a New York office in the comingmonths, with the goal ofexpandingto the top 50 U.S. cities as quickly as possible.Were at this inflection point where weve gone from a midwestern brand to a national player, Nielsen says. Now were setting our sights on being the leading provider in this space across the world.
