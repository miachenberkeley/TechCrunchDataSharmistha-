Its been a prettybusy and expensive 2015 so far for Expedia  which forked out $280 million to buy Travelcityin February, before shelling out $1.6 billion for Orbitz a week later  but the travel giant is divesting one major assetafter it sold its majority stake in eLong, its loss-makingpartner in China, for $671 million.Expedias 62.4 percent ownership ofthe company was snapped up by a bevy of Chinese travel firms, including eLongs fierce rival andtravel heavyweightCtrip, hospitality firms Keystone Lodging andPlaten Group,and investment companyLuxuriant Holdings. Ctrip separately clarified that it paid around $400 million for a 37.6 percentshare.While Expedia didnt say why it isexiting the eLong business, the overwhelming evidence points to this being a financial decision. eLong has struggled to turn in profitit recordeda $33million (EBITDA) loss in its recent Q1 2015. Prospects of a turnaround any time soon were remote, and the street seems happy with the divestment:Expedia shares jumped 7 percent on news of the deal on Friday.The deal does, however, leave Expedia without a partner in China. To address that, it hasteamed up with Ctrip although thestatement explaining how the two will work together is fairly vague:Expedia and Ctrip have agreed to cooperate with each other to allow their respective customers to benefit from certain travel product offerings for specified geographic marketsThat alliance makes senseaseLong was Expedias strategic partner in China. The U.S. firm first invested in the travel marketplace in early 2011, and it followed thatupwith a joint $126 million deal with Tencent in May 2011. Priorities change, however, and it seems that eLongs business and future potential couldntjustify the weight that it added to the overall Expedia balance sheet.
