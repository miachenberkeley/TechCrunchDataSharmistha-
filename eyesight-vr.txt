Over the past few years EyeSight has been establishing a name for itself by bringing gesture control to a series of computing platforms, from mobile devices to smart eyeglasses. Todays announcement brings the companys technology to the formatwhere it arguably makes the most sense: virtual reality.The company isnt letting out much info on the project. I reached out to a spokesperson who told me that due to the proprietary nature of the technology,EyeSightwont disclosespecifics. What we do know, however, is that thenew VR offering is a software solution that utilizes existing smartphone cameras to bring motion control to phone-based virtual reality systemsalong the lines ofGoogle Cardboard.The offering does so without the need for any additional hardware, utilizing the phones CMOS sensors. The Israeli startup has detailed some simple functionality in a YouTube video:This is all still in the early stages, but EyeSightdid reveal plans to open up the SDKto developers in the near future. I asked the companys CEO Gideon Shmuel to explain what his company is offering, apart from other recent attempts to bring motion controls to the virtual reality landscape.[We]designed our computer vision to provide more engaging interactions with VR using finger movements that are natural and intuitive to the user, Shmuel told me. By delivering gesture control solutions that are embedded, we enable touch-free interactions for VR without any hardware additions or modifications needed, while we are further working to deliver immersive touch-free control with 3D sensors that are both embedded or computer powered.Hopefully well get a more immersive demo in the near future. Stay tuned.
