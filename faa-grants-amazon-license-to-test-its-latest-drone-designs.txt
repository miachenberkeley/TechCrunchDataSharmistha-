Amazon can now test its current drone designs,the FAA told the company in a letterthis week.The FAA had previously cleared Amazons petition from July 2014 to test its drones lat month. Between Amazon asking for this petition and the FAA clearing it, but Amazons design had changed quite a bit since it first logged its application, as the companys VP of global public policy Paul Misener told a Senate committee last month. Now, Amazon is free to test this new design in the U.S., as well.Sadly, the filing that includes all of the details of Amazons home-built drone remains confidential, so its unclearwhat exactly it looks like. All we know is that it stays within the FAAs rules, which allow the drone to weigh up to 55 pounds, speeds up to 100 miles per hour and flight levels up to 400 feet above ground.Just like before, though, the drone must always remain within line of sight of the pilot, so any long-distance tests are still not an option for Amazon, but at least it will be able to test how to drop off that package of toothpaste you ordered with Prime Air.Amazons petition for an exception, as well as a number of new licenses the FAA granted this week are among the first that implement a slightly lowerlicense requirement for the drones pilots, too. While they previously needed a private pilot license (a requirement that will not carry over once the FAAs proposed commercial drone rules go into effect), now a recreational or sport pilot license is enough.These licenses carry more restrictions when it comes to flying regular single-engine planes, but are cheaper and easier toget and dont involve medical exams.
