The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today announced that it hasplans to givedrone operator SkyPan, an aerial photography firm, a record $1.9 million fine for endangering the safety of our airspace.According to the FAA, SkyPan illegally operatedits drones between 2012 and 2014 and in the process, repeatedly violated not just the FAAs rules, but also operated within the tightly controlled airspace around New Yorks and Chicagos airports.The FAA says SkyPan conducted a total of 65 unauthorized flights. The majority of those were in the New York Class B airspace around some of the nations busiest airports.Flying unmanned aircraft in violation of the Federal Aviation regulations is illegal and can be dangerous, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta in a statement today. We have the safest airspace in the world, and everyone who uses it must understand and observe our comprehensive set of rules and regulations.The company now has 30 days to respond to the FAAs claims. A company spokesperson tells us that SkyPan has not been able to review the case against it yet. Until we are able to do so, we are unable to comment on it.Update: SkyPan has provided us with a new statement: SkyPan has been conducting aerial photography above private property in urban areas for 27 years in full compliance with published FAA regulations. SkyPan is fully insured and proud of its impeccable record of protecting the publics safety, security and privacy. Images produced by SkyPan have been used to sell or lease commercial and residential real estate throughout North America.

By now, the administration has given waivers to almost 1,750 drone operators and its adding more every week. SkyPan itself now holds one of the so-called 333 exemptions for flying a remote-controlled Align Trex helicopter.Itll still be a while before the FAA will finalize its rules for operating drones in U.S. airspace. Indeed, the FAA missed its congressionally mandated deadline for establishing these rules a few days ago, but at least it has already released a set of proposed regulations that are, for the most part, pretty reasonable.
