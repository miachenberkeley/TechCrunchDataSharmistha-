Eduardo Saverin  yes, theEduardo Saverin of Facebook fame  is already a prominent investor in Asia, but his profile and spending is about to increase significantlyafter a new fund he is heading upmade its first close.B Capital is founded by Saverin, who swapped life inthe U.S. for Singapore more than five years ago,and Raj Ganguly, a prominent investor who worked with Saverin on his previousVelos fund among other things. The new fund has closed an initial$143.6 million according to U.S. filings cited by The Wall Street Journal. In a letter to friends of B Capital obtained by TechCrunch, Saverin and Ganguly wrote that the first close has seen the fund pull in nearly 60 percent of its target money  that means it is likely to close out just shy of $250million once fully stocked.In the letter, Saverin andGanguly explained their investing ethos, that innovation can come from anywhere.They said that there are focused on finding innovative companies and providing them with the resources and networks to develop.In a blog post on LinkedIn, the B Capital founders echoed those sentiments, further explaining that thefocus is on India and Southeast Asia because they believe that they can add significant value in theseregions where key parts of the ecosystem are missing or underserved.Whether it is funding availability, stage, talent, institutions, or exits, the presence of such whitespaces in the ecosystem makes it equally challenging and rewarding for investors. We are very excited and bullish in the long run because we see the opportunity to bridge that gap and make a positive impact in a community of two billion people, they wrote. (The whole post is well worth reading to understand the potential of emerging markets.)In particular, they argued, there is a funding game fromthe Series B and Series C stages, which makes the already challenging growth phase of a startup all the more testing when there are fewer investors able to write checks and provide the kind of support necessary to scale a business.B Capital may be deployingits capital in developing markets, but it has a presence in Silicon Valley after hiring Singaporean nationalGavin Teo from Comcast Ventures to lead its San Francisco office. The funds main headquarters is in Singapore, and it has already invested in logistics firm Ninja Van, which recently closed a $30 million round, and digital health startupEvidation Health.
