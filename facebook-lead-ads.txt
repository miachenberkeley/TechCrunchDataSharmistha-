Businesses desperately want your email address, but its annoying to enter it on mobile. Cue Facebooks latest News Feed ads. A marketer can buy an adasking for you to sign-up for a newsletter or request a sales call, and with two-taps you can auto-fill your email address, phone number, or other info youve registered with Facebook.Facebook is testing these Lead Ads with a small group of businesses around the world to gain feedback before considering rolling them out. Google has tested similar contact form ads for years, but they always required users to manually enter their info.Facebooks ads can auto-fill any of these pieces of information:To make Facebooks ads privacy-friendly, Facebook wont just hand your info over. You have to click the call-to-action button like Subscribe, and then Submit your info once youve reviewed what was auto-filled. Users can edit that info inside the ads, and businesses only get whats voluntarily submitted. From there, advertisers can only use the data in accordance with a mini-privacy policy they embed in the ad, and cant resell it to anyone else.This is one more part of Facebooks quest to absorb the Internet. The Lead Ads fits right in with buy buttons on ads, hosted videos and Instant Articles.Rather than ads that lead you offsite to fill out sign-up forms, its pulling that experience into the News Feed, so when youre done, you keep right on social networking. Removing the click away and manual data entry could drastically boost conversion rates on these kinds of ads, making them easier to sell at higher prices.You could try to bend this as some privacy attack on users, but its not. Youre going to see ads anyway unless you like stealing services through Adblock. You still choose whether to give a marketer your data or not. Its just way easier to do so now. And personally, Id be happy if I never had to manually punch my email address into a dinky mobile form again.
