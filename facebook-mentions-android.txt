News just in thatsstrictly for the one-percenters among us: Facebook Mentions, the service for verified users of the global social network, is now available for users with Android devices.Theapp isnt open to all, you need that elusive blue tick of verification/fame to get it. Thats because its designed to give verified users a way to easily share public status updates, photos and videos with fans on the go  all without spamming their actual friends along the way. Mentions will only post publicly, to fans and followers, but  crucially  it is also the designated app for live video streaming. (Live broadcasting was initially just for famous people, but Facebook begangradually rolling it out to all userslast month.)Facebook launched Mentions for iOS way back in July 2014so its certainly taken the app, which is marketed atactors, athletes, musicians and other influencers, some time to make its way to the Android side of mobile.So, in summary, if youre anambitious young TechCrunch reader, youwont need to dump yourSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge or Xiaomi Mi Note when youmake it big as a celeb, famous tech founder or sports player. Thats one less weight off your mind, no doubt.
