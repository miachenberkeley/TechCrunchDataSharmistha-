It seems that with every earnings report, we hit another milestone in Facebooks shift to mobile. Heres the latest one: 526 million of its monthly active users access Facebook solely from their mobile devices.Thats up from 456 million in the previous quarter, and its an increase of around 78 percent from the 296 million mobile-only users that Facebook saw during the same period last year. That also represents about 38 percent ofFacebooks 1.39 billion monthly active users.You can see the growth in the chart above, which is from the slides accompanying Facebooks fourth-quarter earnings report. (If you cant quite make out the fine print, for the mobile only number, Facebook is counting usage of its mobile app and mobile website, as well as usage of Messenger, but not WhatsApp or Instagram.)Just in case you doubted whether Facebooks mobile user base is really big, there are some other mobile stats in the report  745 million daily active users on mobile, 1.19 billion monthly active users on mobile (but not necessarily mobile-only). Most noteworthy, perhaps, was the fact that mobile represented 69 percent of Facebooks $3.59 billion in ad revenue, compared to 53 percent during the same period last year.Update: I tweaked the headline and opening paragraph of this post because mobile probably includes more than just phones.
