**Look away now if you need to be productive today**We good? Ok then. Facebook sneaked a secret basketball mini-game into Messenger. And its insanely addictive, borderline annoying playable.Perhaps inspired by March Madness,the hoop shooting game can be unlocked by sending a basketball emoji ()to a friend or group in the latest version of the Messenger app, and then simply clicking on it.Slidingyour finger/thumb to shoot, youscore a point for every consecutive basket that you net and the scores are shared in your chat with a friend or group.After you score 10the target starts to move, after 20 it moves faster and thats about as far as I could get even though the game has sucked in plenty of my time today. I topped out at 21  let us know what your best effort is.This isnt the first time Facebook has droppedgames into Messenger, but this time around it seems more compelling than the chess game that arrived in February.But, we warned, enter into this one at your own peril!Hat tip The Next Web
