Heres a crazy idea: Online ads are only worthwhile if theyre actually seen by human eyes.Actually, that might seem pretty obvious, but even though there have been efforts to move in this direction,the industry has historically focused on ads served. That means theyre counted evenif theyre at the bottom of a web page and no one scrolls down to see them.Facebook laid out its position on the issue in a new blog post titled The Value of Viewed Impressions, which makes two main points  that advertisersshould focus on viewed impressions, not served impressions, and that Facebook already works this way.We measure an ad impression the moment an ad enters the screen of a desktop browser or mobile app, the company writes. If an ad doesnt enter the screen, we dont count it as an ad impression.Now, when we talk about Facebook advertising, were talking about a few different things  there are the ads on Facebook itself, and then theres the broader ad platform that the company is building, particularly its Audience Network and the relaunched Atlas, which basically bring Facebook ads and ad tech to outside websites and mobile apps.Brad Smallwood, Facebooks vice president of measurement and insights, told me that when the company is talking about ad measurement, its really talking about Facebook and Instagram. For Atlas and the Audience Network, they have to work with publishers existing practices, but he added, From a strategy perspective, Facebook  is focused on this viewable standard.If this isnt a new practice on Facebooks part (This is the way Facebooks ad server has worked for some time now, Smallwood told me), why bring it up today? Smallwood said the company is trying to push the industry towards this concept of viewed impressions instead of served impressions. Plus, its a good way to suggest that Facebooks ad impressions may be a bit more valuable, since people actually see them.The company has an advantage on this front, since many of its ads run in its newsfeed, so youre more likely to scroll past it as you move down the feed. Smallwood argued that if you scroll past an ad, even if you dont interact with it in, you still saw it, and it still moved whatevers being advertised to your top of mind. (Facebook is also expanding its tools for measuring when ad impressions lead to online and offline sales.)Smallwood also suggested that Facebook has a unique perspective in a couple of other ways, namely its preponderance of ad revenue from mobile, and the fact that itsapplying its standards for viewable impressions globally.Facebooks blog posts highlights a few partners that Facebook is working with on these fronts, including the Media Rating Council (the group that establishes the standards around ad measurement), The Wendys Company (yep, that Wendys), and ad agency Zenith Optimedia.
