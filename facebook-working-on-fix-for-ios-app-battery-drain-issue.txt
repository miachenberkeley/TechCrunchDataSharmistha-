Facebook has confirmed it is investigating reports ofexcessivebattery drain caused by its iOS app apparently continuing to run processes in the background  even with background app refresh disabled.In a statement provided to TechCrunch a spokesperson for the company confirmed it is investigating the issue, adding that ithopes to be able to put out a fix soon.We have heard reports of some people experiencing battery issues with our iOS app. Were looking into this and hope to have a fix in place soon, the spokesperson said.Blogging about the issue earlier this week, Circa co-founder Matt Galligan couchedthe Facebook apps use of battery asridiculous, noting that the app had been responsible for 15 per cent of all battery drain over aseven-day period  despite having background app refreshed disabled.Because the app isnt sleeping properly when I hit the home button, it continues to drain, he wrote. That extraneous background usage, despite not providing any value to me at all, is keeping the app alive 2x longer than my actual usage.Another user,Nick Heer, also blogging about the issue, dubbedFacebooks use of resources as user hostile, asserting that: Facebook is actively creating channels to continue refreshing their app in the background when the user has explicitly stated that they do not want it to.Also chewing overthe issue this week, MacStories Federico Viticci posited that the extraneous background usagemight be down to Facebook hijacking audio sessions on iOS by keeping silent audio in the background whenever a video plays in the app.Because, by default, videos on Facebook auto-play on both Wi-Fi and Cellular and few people ever bother to turn it off, that means theres a high chance the Facebook app will always find a way to play a video, keep audio in the background, and consume energy to perform background tasks, he suggested.TCs Romain Dillet, who also runs the Facebook app with background refresh switched off, kept tabs on the appsbattery usage totest a theory as towhether Facebooks autoplay videos feature might be to blame.With background app refresh and autoplay videos disabled the Facebook iOS app used 7 per cent of battery resource on his iPhone 6s over a 24 hour period. Havingautoplay videos enabled appeared to make little difference  with the same 7 per cent drainover another 24 hour period. So notconclusive on whether autoplay videos is part of theproblem. But, as regards background battery drain, still showing the Facebook app to berather toothirsty vs how much its actually being used.Facebook isnt commenting onany of the varioustheories about whats going on here  whether its audio hijacking and/or using VoIP to keep the app awake against users wishes. But it isapparently fixing something  bug or sly feature  thats responsible for the various reports of extraneous background app activity. So theres that.In the meanwhile, if you want to curtailFacebooks annoying extraneous background app activity you can of course just ditch the app entirely and log into Facebook via the mobile web on your iPhone.
