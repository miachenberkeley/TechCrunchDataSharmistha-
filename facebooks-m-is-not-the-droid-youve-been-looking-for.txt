Facebook unveiledits M personal assistant yesterday, shelled out a few details and revealed that it was currently being beta-tested by a couple hundred random users in the Bay Area. The service is unique in that it is partially human-powered, and these M trainers can complete real tasks like buying items and making reservations.Whatever M eventually turns out to be, it is clear that it is going to be different, and with so many buggy, mediocre digital assistants out there, different has to be a good thing, right?Well, Im not so convinced.Digital assistants as a whole seem too forced on consumers right now, and even M is a bit out of place among them. When flip phones introduced voice control a few years afterthe dawn of this millennium, people were impressed, butoverall it was just a great nerdy dad gimmickto show off. Now, as tech improves, giant companies are treating this very seriously.M bucks theconvention of being voice-activated, it livesinside the Messenger app and is primarily text-based. This is a mistake.AlsoSiri, Google Now, Cortana and (kind of) Alexa all have moments where theyre uniquely helpful, but where they are similar is that they each (mostly) live natively on their own hardware devices.Facebooks M doesnt have aphysical homeand unless Facebooksplanning on dropping asocial OS anytime soon, its not going to. Digital assistants desperately need deep hardware integration in order to be useful because it takes too many steps to reach the functionality otherwise and digital assistants are tools that need to be accessible at a moments notice.Digital assistants are essentially more personable, smarter search engines. In a lot of ways the only difference is branding and more transparency in exposing how much your digital assistant actually knows about you.If digital assistants are search engines, than M is anIm feeling lucky Google search whereyoure probably just getting the oneanswer M believesis most likely to satisfy your need.Facebook isalready lookingpretty naive with the examples theyre providing for how human interactions with M are going tolook.One person chats withM in a screenshot,Im going to Chicago next week. Im looking for a great burger. Where should I go?In situations where youre looking for an answer easily available in Google, liketrying to find a great-ratedburger in Chicago, I really really cantunderstand why anyone would use M.A) You have to type coherent sentences into M for the sake of a human understanding it, whereas in Google you could just type keywords, i.e. best burger chicago.B) Searchresults are instantaneous, if its a question an M assistant has to search for, youre literally waiting on them to Google something for you that you could just have easily done yourself.Another chief problem with M is that even if it suggests a burger joint that youre totally down to try out, a lot of things can still go wrong in the course of making a reservation, and every new problem means. One. More. Message.Voice just works better for clarifying confusion. Navigating complex situations over text is never easy (as argumentswith pastgirlfriends have made apparent).Even people with real assistants prefer to yell at them over the phone when theyre trying to explain what they want. Its too time-consuming otherwise.I dont think people want digital assistants to actually do anything for them, they just want the toolsto get through the discovery phase so that they can navigate the finer details without having to wade through muck.In an article that ran on Wired, Facebook chatted about some of the tasks thatFacebook employees had been using the service for, which included waiting through lengthy callswith Comcast. This would undoubtedly be useful, but am I going to have to give the M assistant all of my personal account info to do this? Are these notifications giving me constant updates?ShouldntI feel shitty for making another live human being deal with Comcast on my behalf?On that note, in another one of the screenshots from thepost, we see a Facebook user ask M to find a gift for their friends baby.How indifferent does a person have to be to tell M yeah sure, just send something?I understand theappeal of text-based personal assistants, because sometimes talking to your phone is wildly impractical depending on the situation, but I can see very few scenarios where Mis more useful than a google search or more importantly a dedicatedappthat you could just as easily open up.Mostof these points assume that what Facebook introduced yesterdaywas really a product, when what it really launched may just bea data-gathering tool to ensure future AI success. Facebook is well-aware that most of the natural language processing technologies that todaysdigital assistants are built on arent advanced enoughto be consistently useful, but thedata you give Facebook aint ever going out of style and theyre going to need that data to power its entrant in the next iteration of AI-poweredassistants.The problem is, data-gathering requires actual users now and I dont think this product structure is going to garner much excitement when it launches even if its great at the things it promises.For the life of me, I just cant understand why this feature was stuck into Messages.I assume they saw the apps 700 million users glowing in front of their eyes as a potential market this product could conquer, but conversational text-based entry is all wrong for an app like this, even if it does give Facebook the easiest data to parse.If Facebook wanted to craft an on-demand app where you could search for something you needed and there was an army of real life people to interpret your needs and direct you through the right UX workflow that might make sense. But typing your way through every step of a problem just isnt practical, no matter what your need is.Its also a shame when Facebook knows what I like so well. Being hated on by privacy advocates is pretty much Facebooks second full-time job, so Id imagine theyre somewhat powerless to do something radical like giving M access to all of my profile info. And without ownership of the hardware where it could track and keep my habits protected on-device like Proactive Siri in iOS 9, itsnot going to get any more useful then Google Now or Siri in terms of background location-awareness.AI-powered assistants will definitely, maybe one day become super useful, but Facebooks strategy for getting the ball rolling here seems awfully meh for a company that knows me so well.
