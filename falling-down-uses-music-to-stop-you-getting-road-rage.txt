Driving is so often a highly charged and emotional affair. Even the mildest-mannered people can turn into aggressive monsters when put behind a steering wheel. AtTechCrunch Disrupts Hackathon today we saw a fun but interesting approachto cooling down hot-heads using wearable tech and music.Erik Erwitt, a developer and consultant, pitched Falling Down, a wearable monitorthattracks a drivers heart rate in order to work out when they are stressing out  higher than usual  or falling sleeping  lower than usual.The system also uses vehicle data. When it detects a drivers heart rate is moving to one extreme and a car is in motion,Falling Down uses Bluetooth to crank out music via the drivers smartphone.Erwitt tested the app in an on-stage demo  he told us that his heart was genuinely racing  using some musicto provide a littlechill and relax him. Most people dont get to pitch a hack on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, but the principles could apply to drivers who get angry. The sounds of Bob Marley, for example, could help you clear the red mist before you go all aggressive and do something stupid.Equally, while a rising heart rate hints at stress and anger, a heart rate that is falling could indicate that a driver is drifting off to sleep. In this case, Falling Down can play something loud or energetic to wake up the driverto prevent a nasty accident.His demo used Spotify on an Android device, but it can be configured to run any kind of music app, and can work on iOS, too.Erwitt called Falling Down a fun and easy hack, but it does aim to help a serious problem. Hetold TechCrunch that he plans to clean up the code and make it available on GitHub for those who want touse itor develop it further.Hopefully it will inspire someone to connect an Android Wear device to the Ford SYNC to monitor peoples heart rate. An important factor to look at is searching for atrial fibrillation in drivers which could be a precursor to heart attack, Erwitt added.
