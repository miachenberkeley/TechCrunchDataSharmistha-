Pornhub, an internet web portal site for videos of people that are naked doing things, which I have never ever visited, ever, shared some interesting traffic. Speaking of things I dont do, a game called Fallout 4 came out on the 10th. And thats where Pornhubs story beginsAccording to the smutwranglers site, gamers chose to play the new game rather thanconsume content on their dirtysockportal:Like watching a good Pornhub video, anticipation of the release had been building up, and once the moment arrived, dedicated gamers thought of little else  including visiting Pornhub.Sigh. But data is fun, right? What did Pornhub find? A massive dip in traffic for the day.Somethingsomethingsomething not getting it up something, whatever.Compared to an average day, we saw a slight 5% increase in traffic among gamers in the early morning hours from 3-4 am. At this point we assume everyones download completed and the gaming commenced. Starting at 5am traffic began to drop, down as much as 10% from 7am till noon. In the afternoon traffic returned to normal, but after 6pm it dropped again when we assume that 9-5 workers arrived home and fired up their games. After midnight it seems like everyone finally took a break, and traffic jumped as high at 15% above daily norms.So yeah. I dont even know what to say to most of this other than have a lovely weekend doing whatever it is you kids do these days. If youd like to umread more of Pornhubs insightshead on over here.
