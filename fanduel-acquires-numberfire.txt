Fantasy sports company FanDuel is acquiring numberFirein a deal that co-founder and CEO Nigel Eccles told me will help FanDuel pursue a vision that goes beyond fantasy sports.Our ambitions have really broadened, Eccles said. Weve started to think of ourselves less as a fantasy sports business  we want to make sports more exciting.To be clear, Eccles does plan to integrate numberFire analytics into FanDuels fantasy sports product (apparently adding more data has been a big request from current players). At the same time, numberFire will also continue to operate as an independent site. And yes, numberFire is itself focused on making recommendations forfantasy sports, but Eccles said theres also an opportunityto educate sports fans, including the ones that arent playing fantasy football.numberFire founder and CEO Nik Bonaddio will be joining FanDuel, as will the rest of his team.I know a lot of people you talk to say that theyre pumped up, but Im super ridiculously unbelievably pumped up, Bonaddiosaid. I couldnt imagine a better landing place for us, where our intellectual property has the best chance to grow and prosper.He addedtheres a broader shift in the sports landscape, with fans moving away from a world where ESPN lobs these general, qualitative statements at them. In this environment, fans want more data, but the challenge is to highlight the information thats relevant and useful  in this case, that means recommendingthe players wholl perform best in your fantasy lineup in a given week.numberFire initially achieved that goal througharticlesthat summarizedsome of the key recommendations gleaned from the data, but Bonaddio said its moving to an increasingly tech-driven approach.FanDuel hasmoved very quickly from five to six years with no acquisitions to making three deals in a few months, Eccles said, and if there are more opportunities toadd strong teams and nice, solid products, then hes open to more deals in the future. He should have the money for it, since FanDueljust raised a $275 million Series E.
