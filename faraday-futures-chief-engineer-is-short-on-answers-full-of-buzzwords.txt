Faraday Futures Nick Sampson joined me on the TechCrunch CES 2016 for what turned out to be a lively interview. Sampson is Faradays Senior Vice President of R&D and engineering and, I guess, moonlights as the companys spokesperson. But hes no Elon Musk.So far even after the companys public reveal, very little is known about Faraday Future. Sampson barely knew how to describe the design features of the wild concept the company had just announced. The company seems more interested in building hype than cars.The full 20 minute interview is embedded here and I have a lot more thoughts on the company that Ill publish in the coming days. From my vantage point, Faraday Future feels like the Donald Trump of startups.
