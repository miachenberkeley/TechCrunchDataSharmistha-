In order to sustain a world population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, well need to double globalcrop production over the next 35 years. For Farmers Business Network (FBN), the solutionis aglobal, big data-powered farmer-to-farmer network  and theyve justraised$15 million in new funding tobuild it.Google Ventures led the round, with help from past investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and impact investment firm DBL. FBN has now raised nearly $28 million in venture funding.Farmers spend billions of dollars per year on seeds and fertilizers, butcurrently, theyrelacking reliable information when it comes to decidingwhich seeds to buy, how many to plant, and whichfertilizers or nutrients will produce the best outcome in different regions.Until now, farmers have had to rely on university trial data from highly controlled experiments, or on information from the seed companies about which seeds to use and what populations to plant, says Charles Baron, co-founder of FBN.Yet neither of these sources accurately represent real-world performance ofcrops.Taking advice from the seed company is a little bit like if Exxon wanted to sell you a car, Exxon would always sell you a suburban, Baron jokes.Since launching in November of last year, FBN has aggregated data from7 million acres of farm land across 17 states, and theyre growing 30% month over month. The platform is currently abletoassessthe performance of 500 seeds and 16 different crops.The innovation isnt in simplycapturing all of this data. Modern agricultural equipment is incredibly technologically advanced, and designed to record everything from the way the seeds are planted to changes in soil chemistry.FBN aggregates and standardizes all of this data being collected fromfarms nationwide to create an analytics dashboard, which alsointegrates outside information like weather or regional soil conditions. By leveragingthe results reported by all farms in the FBN network, farmerscanmake informed decisions about whichagricultural products and practices willproduce the highest output.However surprising it may soundto any of us who are unfamiliarwith theinner workingsof a modern farm, farmers are suffering from a data overload.If you look inside the cab of a modern tractor,youll see like six different screens, and each one is producingdifferent formats of software, says Baron, who tells me that FBN is set upto integratedata from35 different types of farming software.Huge farms that are using this precision equipment havesoftware to analyzethe data on their own farm, so they can spot an irrigation problem or a fertilizer problem from last year and correct it, says Andy Wheeler of Google Ventures, who is joining FBNs board.But the big missing piece has been analyzing this data across many farms, and thats where you can start to get real efficiency gains  when farmers start to share the data amongst each other to get insights on which seeds did best on their soil, or which farming practices enabled them to get a higher yield, Wheelersays.This can save farmers some serious cash. Baron tells me thatthe average FBN farmer, for instance, is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of seed per year. If they can determine that5-10% of this seedis not producing, theyre able to significantly reducecosts.Farmers operate on razor-thin margins, and in the current environment with very low commodity prices and high input prices, farmers are barely able to make a profit, Baron says.Profit aside,increasing efficiency and maximizing output per acre could be our best shot at delayingaglobal food crisis.
