The FCC has responded to concerns that PayPals updated user agreement, which givesthe company the right to robocall and text customers,by informing PayPal that it may be in violation of federal law. Oneissue, according to the FCC, is that consenting to robocalls cannot be a condition of using PayPals service. In addition, customers must provide prior written consent before receiving robocalls, they must be able to opt out, and if they choose to consent, they must be able to specify which phone number theyre agreeingto be contacted on by PayPal.The language in PayPals user agreement didnt substantially change between the prior revision and the one thats going live on July 1st. However, possibly because of the FCCs plans to vote on a series of new rules designed to crack down on telemarketing and robocalls  specifically those to cell phones  the changes caught the attention of the media.Sites including BGR and The Washington Post pointedout that PayPals new policy seemed to be giving the companythe right to robocall and text customers for a number of reasons  ranging from being able to contact users about account activity to even sending out surveys and questionnaires or offers and promotions.The way the user agreement readsdoes not make it clear that consumers have the right to refuse being contacted by PayPal through robocalls and still use itsservice, which would put it in violation of theTelephone Consumer Protection Act.According to the FCCs letter addressed to PayPal on June 11, 2015, violations such as these could subject PayPal, its affiliates, and its service providers with penalties of up to $16,000 per call or text message.The FCC was alerted to the problem by way of media reports and other sources, including the National Consumer Law Center, anonprofit consumer advocacy group which has been leading efforts toprotect consumers from robocalls for years.The organization presented their concerns to the FCC on June 4. One of the National Consumer Law Centers specific issueshas to do with whether PayPal can make revocation of consent a condition of its contract with users.In the FCCs letter, the organization reminds PayPal that autodialed, prerecorded, and artificial voice calls are subject to strict limitations, one of which is obtaining prior express written consent to of the recipients. If calls are for purposes other than telemarketing, PayPal must also get prior express consent (either oral or written) for such calls to wireless phones, the letter states.For PayPal,there are a number of potential issues with simply having a clause in the user agreement that states its okay for the company to robocall customers.For starters, agreeing to theclause cannot be a condition of using PayPals service. In other words, if a consumer clicks no they dont agree to the updated User Agreements terms  are they still allowed to use PayPal? Thats unclear.Secondly, PayPal customers are supposed to provide written consent to identify which phone number can be called or texted. (PayPals agreement instead says it can contact customers at any telephone number that you have provided us or that we have otherwise obtained.) The FCC reminds PayPal in its letterthat many consumers have more than one telephone line and they have the right to choose on which line(s) they wish to receive telemarketing or advertising calls, if they elect to receive such calls at all.And finally, if the nature of consent is ever contested, PayPal must be able to show that unambiguous consent was obtained, the FCC says.PayPal confirms its in receipt of the letter and will respond. According to a PayPal spokesperson:We have received a letter from the FCC and look forward to responding. We strive to be as clear as possible with our customers and clarified our policies and practices last week on the PayPal blog. Our customers can choose not to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls.The payments company seemed to have been taken by surprise by the news, given that it had, for some time, included a similar provision in its User Agreement before the one noticed by the media. Wrote the company in its blog post: This is not a new section in the User Agreement and we want to take this opportunity to explain our position on contacting our customers.That could mean that PayPal had been in violation of the federal regulations even before the new user agreement emerged. As it stands today, the company says users can opt-out of this clause by contacting PayPal. That alone doesnt appear to meet the federal guidelines. Additionally, from anecdotal reports, we understand that some customers have had trouble with PayPals opt-out procedures.The company says customers can contact customer support and choose not to receive autodialed or prerecorded messages. That process has been troublesome, for some. One customer told TechCrunch theytried four times to call PayPal customer service and opt out, but were told each time that it was not possible. They also tried to help friends and clients, and had the same experience. Others tried contacting PayPal on Facebook, and were given a similar answer. (See image below).PayPal told us on June 5 it hadsent out aninternal communication to itscustomer support teams so they are all fully prepped to help customers on the matter, but we heard fromcustomers who still couldnt opt out after this memo was shared.That implies the company was reacting the recent news, rather than already having established, compliant procedures in place.Even if PayPal customers opt out (or refuse to consent to) robocalls, that doesnt mean that PayPal would be out of options when it came to contacting customers about routine account issues, collections, or even emergencies.Theres no limitation in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act against manual-dialed phone calls, explains Margot Saunders, counsel for theNational Consumer Law Center. Andtheres no limitation against passing contact information along to debt collectorsor other third-parties when consumers agree to robocalls, she says. But the law has put limits on robocalls to cell phones.Those limits are there both for privacy reasons and for cost reasons, Saunders continues. Most people communicate with PayPal online, and theres no limit to emails. Theres no limit to notices by snail mail, either. PayPal is not at a loss for other remedies.She adds thattheFCCs proposed new ruleswill allow companies like PayPal to contact customers without consent in emergency situations, including when theres a data breach. The FCC is set to vote on this and a number of other changes that would crack down on telemarketing on June 18, in a vote thats expected to pass.Below: Letter to FCC (via Consumerist); NCLC Letter to the FCCFCC Letter To PayPalNational Consumer Law Center
