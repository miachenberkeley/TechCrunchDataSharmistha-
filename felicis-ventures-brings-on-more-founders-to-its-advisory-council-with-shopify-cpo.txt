Several years ago, venture investor Aydin Senkut just showed up at Shopifys headquarters in Ottawa.He had heard about them from the organizers of the Grow Conference in Vancouver and decided to stop by apropos of nothing.At the time, no one really knew who we were, said chief platformofficer Harley Finkelstein. But we knew of Aydins reputation and that he was an early employee at Google. It was not only really exciting. It wasreally humbling.They hit off and Senkuts Felicis Ventures would go on to participate in Shopifys Series A and then its subsequent rounds. Today, Shopifyhas 150,000 active stores and led to$7 billion worth of sales.So theres a little bit of payit forward happening now.Finkelstein is now joining anadvisory council that Felicis isstacking with successful founders out of their previous investments. Jack Abraham, who founded Milo, is one of the others. He came up with an idea that Felicis would automatically vote its shares with the founders. Senkut later adopted it.Its a very unique group of people, Senkut said. Its very small, but were happy that wereexpanding it with some unusual characters and unsung heroes.Finkelstein expectsthat hell probably helpFelicissource deals out of Canada too.Itsgreat for the Canadian startup scene .We dont have these super connected experienced investors out here like you do in the U.S., he said. So its quite flattering to see U.S. investorsturning their experience towardCanadian experience.
