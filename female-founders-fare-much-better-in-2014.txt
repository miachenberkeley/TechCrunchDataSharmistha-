Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.In a placewhere having a penis is referred to as thesine qua nonof the startup founder, its easytojump on thepessimism bandwagonand overlookany gradualmomentum for women in tech.But the data tells a different story.Of the 1090U.S. startups that raised Series A rounds in 2014, approximately 10 percent were founded by women. By state, California and New York stood on equal footing just slightly above the national average, where 12 percent of companieshad at least one female founder.Ohio, Florida and Maryland led the charge for progress,racking up at least15 rounds each with over 20 percent raised by female founders. Texas, on the other hand, sported some pretty disconcertingresults  42 startups funded and not a single femalefounder in the bunch.Sure, these numbers are far from an equal split. But consideringhowearly stage female founders fared in 2013  securing barely5 percent of totalSeries A rounds recorded  it looks like the times are changing, and quickly.Anyone who says they cant find good women entrepreneurs to invest in is not looking, says Susan Lyne, who recently stepped down as AOLs Brand CEO to launch female-focused VC fund BBG Ventures.Most people are comfortable with either companies or entrepreneurs that look like them, says Lyne, so even though Ive yet to meet a guy who doesnt say Im really happy youre doing this  and a lot of them are fathers of daughters so they have a rooting interest in it being fixed  theres a difference between having a rooting interest and actively addressing how youre going to fix it.BBG is just one of a handful ofnewfunds activelyseekingoutwomen entrepreneurs (or#FlawlessFemaleFounders, as 500 Startups has dubbed them).New York-basedFemale Founders Fundis perhaps the most active so far  launched in 2013 byAnu Duggal, F Cubedhas closed13 deals for female-led companies to date.And Duggal has already seen four founders shes backed through F Cubedreturning to invest in the fund.In 2013 if you look at the A rounds in New York for startups with a female founder and CEO, there was one, andin 2014, there were 12, says Duggal so thats a huge jump. And this is our thesis  that New York is going to spawn a talented group of women across all industries.Consideringthat the percentage of female-founded companies raising A rounds in New York more thandoubled in the span of a singleyear, its aconvincing argument.Series A funding isnt the only evidenceof a diminishinggender gap in2014. For the first time, UC Berkeleys Intro to Computer Science course saw more female than malestudents participating. And an all female-founded startup took home theDisrupt Cup at TechCrunchs Battlefield competitionin the heart of the Silicon Valley.Its a long way from a level playing field, but its a start.
