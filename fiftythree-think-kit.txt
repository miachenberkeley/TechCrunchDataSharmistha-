FiftyThree, a startup focused on unlocking creativity on the iPad, is rolling out a new set of tools that it hopes will address a whole new set of users. With the introduction of its new Think Kit toolset in its Paper app, FiftyThree will extend its reach from creatives into business or education applications.To date, FiftyThree has been mostly focused on tools for drawing and illustrating. Its ultra-popular Paper app, which included instruments like a calligraphy pen, a charcoal pencil, and watercolor brush, was built with that in mind and its Pencil stylus was released to augment the app. With the release of its Mix feature, the company enabled users to remix and collaborate with each other on projects.Now that the app has been downloaded more than 14 million times, the launch of Think Kit and the unveiling of FiftyThrees Intention Engine will give users new tools that can be applied in the enterprise and education markets. It is, in a lot of ways, making it easier for users to create and share diagrams, notes, or other drawings.The tools provided as part of Think Kit are meant kind of as a digital replacement for the whiteboard, giving users the freedom and flexibility to quickly brainstorm without being tied down by the limitations or complexity of presentation tools like PowerPoint or Keynote.With Think Kits intention engine and other features, users can draw shapes and connectors, and have visual models created for them. That kind of presentation would be perfect for things like wireframes, models, user flows, and other illustrations designed to be quickly shared and iterated on. Once completed, those projects can be exported to other presentation apps, including Keynote, PowerPoint, Trello, Evernote, Dropbox, and more.When FiftyThree first teased Think Kit, the plan was to sell it as an add-on to the existing set of Paper tools. Since then, the company decided to keep the new features free and make the bulk of its money through the sale of its Pencil hardware.The launch of Think Kit follows the companys most recent fundraise, under which it brought in $30 million led by NEA. Altogether, it has raised $45 million in funding, with other investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Highline Ventures, Thrive Capital, SV Angels, and Jack Dorsey.
