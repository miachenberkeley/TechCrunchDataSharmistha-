Tech companies have been releasing data about diversity for the past year or so, but relatively little is known aboutdiversity in the startup and venture capital ecosystem.Enter the 2015 Venture Census, a survey started by the National Venture Capital Association, Dow Jones VentureSource and CrunchBase.The survey, which just launched today, aims to collect data around diversity at tech startups, venture capital firms, accelerators and in other parts of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The survey focuses on characteristics like gender, age, sexual orientation, educational and professional background and military experience.We believe we need a better understanding of our history and our present before we can affect the future, NVCA Diversity Task Force and Research Team Co-Chair Ashton Newhall said in a release. It is my hope that this data collection effort establishes a baseline which we canimprove upon for many years to come.Its open to anyone who works in the startup, venture capital and tech ecosystem, and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Well be reporting the results in the fall once the survey is over, so stay tuned.
