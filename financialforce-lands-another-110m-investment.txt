FinancialForce, the cloud ERP system (enterprise resource planning) built on top of the Salesforce1 platform, announced a new round of funding tonight, landing $110M in additional investment.This round follows a $50M round just last April. Todays investmentis led by Technology Crossover Ventures with additional money coming from Salesforce Ventures. It brings thetotal investment to $186.3M.The funding comes on the heels of a pretty successful year, one which apparently piqued the interest of the companys investors, who must believe their growth trajectory will continue. The company reported a 91 percent annual subscription run rate and a $50 million revenue run rate in 2014  and CEO Jeremy Roche says investors are capitalizing on the growth of the business.That momentum and an increasing demand for back-office software in the cloud is really driving the investment, he explained. In the first phase of enterprise software in the cloud, we saw front office software like CRM, office productivity software, marketing automation and content management. As the cloud matures, we are seeing more back-office functions like ERP movingto the cloud and gaining traction.Up until now, its a market that has been dominated by the usual suspects SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, but cloud players like FinancialForce and NetSuite are beginning to make some noise. While Roche admits $50M does not represent a serious threat to these players yet, thats where hes setting his sights.With more than $186M in investment, some might see an IPO in the companys future and while Roche says the company is eminently IPOable,  he gave the standard CEO answer of wanting to grow the business and seeing what happens.For now, he says the companyplans to take the money and spread it across the business whether thats research and development, customer service or sales and marketing.The organizationcurrently has 525 employees and he hopes to crank that up to 750 by the end of this year.With so many new employees coming on boardin such a short time, the company has planned for this by creating a Knowledge Department, whose job is to educate new hires aboutthe general company mission, while leaving the specifics of each job to the department management. Roche says the goal is to be sure that every employee is ready when he or she sits down to do actual work.FinancialForce also works directly with Salesforce.com quite often because the companiesoffer complementary products with Salesforce concentrating on the front office and FinancialForce concentrating on the back.When I suggested that Salesforce, which is also an investor would be a good company to purchase FinancialForce at some point (they even share the force in their names), Roche brushed it aside as he did with the IPO suggestion, but its not so far fetched to imagine Salesforce wanting to buy its way into the back office.For now FinancialForce is doing fine on its own, even if Roche calls his companys relationship with Salesforce symbiotic.What weve set out to do when we built thebusiness wasto use new technology from Salesforce (the platform as a service) and use the back office in a different way, so its customer focused, he said.He added, Its an important part of engagement with customers, just as front office systems are.
