Did you guys see that Coca Cola Super Bowl commercial?You know the one. It opens with a weird montage of people who are sad because of the Internet, then segues into a Tron-style data center, where some guy spills Coke on a server. Now, you might think that this would be bad news, but no! Instead of everything breaking down, some puzzling combination of Coca Cola and positive emotions floods everyones computer, and everything is great.To be honest, Im not sure this is a 100 percent accurate representation of how technology works. Nonetheless, it represents an interesting new social media campaign (which Coca Cola is also promoting on Twitter, natch). As explained on the Make It Happy website, youre supposed to find negative tweets, then reply to them with the #MakeItHappy hashtag. Coke, in turn, will respond with a happy piece of art made from their post.@mstisamarie #MakeItHappy is more than a hashtag. Reply to negative Tweets and see! http://t.co/kazqupgXKm pic.twitter.com/UOAfuoW5OJ Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) February 2, 2015What does that have to do with Coca Cola? I couldnt tell ya. Is positivity inherently better than negativity? Not necessarily, in my opinion. And will this actually make the Internet a more positive place? Probably not.But hey, the art made me smile. Especially after the unrelenting bleakness of all those other Super Bowl commercials.
