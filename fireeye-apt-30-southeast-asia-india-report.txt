The Chinese government is accused of being behind a newly discoveredset ofcyber attacks waged againstgovernment agencies, corporate companies and journalistsacross India and Southeast Asia overthe pastten years.Security firm FireEye released a report todayrevealing a spate ofcorporate espionage and cyber spying offenses againsttargets located inIndia,Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Nepal, Singapore,Philippines, Indonesia and beyond. The group said attacks began in 2005.Theres no smoking gun that shows this is a Chinese government operation, but all signs point to ChinaFireEyes APAC CTO Bryce Boland told TechCrunch in an interview. Thereshuge intellectual property development in Asia  thats the new battleground.Boland referencedseveralpieces of evidence collected byFireEye following months of research. In particular,the existence ofan operating manual written in Chinese, a code basethat was seemingly developed by Chinese developers, and a related domain registered to a suspicious tea company in rural China, allimply Chinese involvement.FireEye said too thatthe nature of thetargets  which remain undisclosed  offers a further,important clue.Their targets possess information that most likely serves the Chinese governments needs for intelligence about key Southeast Asian regional political, economic, and military issues, disputed territories, and discussions related to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party, the company said in an announcement.FireEyes report caps a rough few days of media coverage for Chinas internet strategy. China put on a (falsely) friendly front when hosted the World Internet Conference last year, but increasingly we hear about its efforts to police the web. Last week,Citizen Lab issued a report detailed Great Canon, a new technology that allows the Chinese government to take down websites  like Github.com usinga worryingly direct and offensive approach.Of course, it is possible that the attacks highlighted by FireEyewere not run directly by the state, and instead byaprofessional espionage agency, which may have sold secrets to Chinese corporates or eventhe government itself. Actors are very often a few degrees removed, and concrete evidence is hard to find.Identities aside, the sheer scale and professionalism of the operations stood out.The system includes avery coherent development plan, Boland said. There appear to be two developers working the backend tools for the attack operators, while another develops the attack tools themselves.All-in-all, FireEye detected more than 200 distinction variations of malware developed by the group  indicating that it was a prolific effort. The fact that these attacksremained undetected for so long is troubling given the sensitivity of the targets, but there is a positive. Boland explained that because the infrastructure of the attacks had been able toremain similar for years, it isnt difficulttocheck on potential compromises and take action if needed.Dubbed APT 30  APT stands for advanced persistent threat group  FireEye claimed the attacks have included some particularly sophisticated strategies, including perhaps the earliest efforts againstair gap networks  mission critical or sensitive systems that remain offline for safety.This group has had the ability to make attacks on air gap networks since 2006, Boland revealed. Thats quite unusual, since the first known examples were Russian attackers in 2008 and 2009.FireEye shared its report with certain intelligence agencies worldwide in advance of making it public today. Though Boland declined to be more specific about exactly which ones had been contacted, he did confirm thatFireEye does not provide details of itsintelligence or reportstothe Chinese government.
