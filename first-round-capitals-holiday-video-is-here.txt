In the tech world its just not the holidays until First Round Capital drops its annual holiday video. Its that time again, folks. The annual festivities started way back in 2008, the year of our blog. Then it happened again and again.If youd like to sing along, youll find the lyrics below the video. They are most certainlyspecial. I wont ruin anything for you, because its fun to catch all of the buzzy references made in the video. If you work in tech, be sure to screenshot all of your friends who appear so that you can tweet them later as reaction shots when they say something dumb.And heres my top 5 favorite moments:Heres those lyrics I mentioned:Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
