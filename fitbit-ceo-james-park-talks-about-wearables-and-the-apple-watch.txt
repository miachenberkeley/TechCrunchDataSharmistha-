Fitbit recently announced a new smart devices, the Surge and the Charge and took to CES to show just how cool they were. I got the chance to sit down with CEO James Park to talk wearables, heart rate monitors, and his expectations for the Apple Watch.See, Fitbit isnt afraid and Im not sure they should be. While a true popular wearable will cut into some fashion and tech watch markets, Park feels that his audience is considerably different than Apples. In short, the folks who want Fitbits arent the folks who want Apple Watches.Park is a well-spoken and surprisingly interesting CEO and its great getting to catch up with him at CES. Check out the video and expect reviews of the new devices soon.
