Ever spend more time looking for something to watch on Netflix than actually watching something on Netflix? Thats because of the sites addiction to brevity. Titles are hidden by sliding bars that requires clicking to reveal more titles. This bookmarklet fixes the issue. Its called God Mode and I love it.Just pop the bookmarklet into your bookmark bar and load Netflix. Once logged in, click the bookmark button to expand all the sliding bars into grids of movies. Its not as pretty, but damn is easier to use.Suddenly you can see all the movies and TV shows at once. Theres no need to click around on the interface to reveal hidden titles. Its beautiful in a purely functional way.Netflix has a wonderful problem. It simply has too much content, and the streaming service is constantly testing new interfaces to address it. Ive found that the best Netflix user interface is found in the Windows 8 app where a ton of content is visible at once. Want to see more? Swipe left or right and more is revealed. Its lovely and a natural fit for scrolling. Sadly Netflix has failed to develop such a compelling interface for different operating systems, which is why hacks like God Mode exist.
