Fleksy, the popular third-party keyboard app for iOS and Android, has taken the next step tomonetizing its service after it began enabling deep-linking toother apps.The new features are powered byURX, a San Francisco-based deep-linking search startup that graduated Y Combinator, and allow users to seamlessly interact withcontent from other apps via their keyboard, without leaving the app they are using. These features are the kind you might find in a messaging app, particularly those in Asia, but Fleksy wants to enable that kind of functionality from any app on your phone.Fleksyskeyboard app is one of the most popular out there, although the company wouldonly say that it is used by millions. The app went free last month and the companys future revenue opportunities arebased around users customizing their keyboard with premium themes, andcontextual services and opportunities to provide relevant information to users. (Aswe noted when Fleksy partnered with Imoji to add custom stickers back in May.)The idea is a solid one. Keyboard apps are a constant for those who download them, theyare red-hotreal estate for anyone with an interest in mobile.Fleksy CEO and co-founderKosta Eleftheriou told TechCrunch that users look at their keyboard an average of180 times per day, and for a cumulative total of 90 minutes. Beyond being a constant part of their experience, Fleksy is also able to learn a lot about a user  thats an area whereEleftheriou believes the keyboard can delight by providing useful services and assistance.Initially the Flesky-URX tie-up makes the most sense for media  when Drake is part of aconversion, users are presented song recommendations inside SoundCloud andSpotify, Fleksy said  but there are clear opportunities to go way beyond that.URX makes moneyfacilitatingapp downloads and re-engaging users  for the latter, thinkusers buying items from a shopping app they already downloaded  andEleftheriou admitted that some of the interactions that the tie-up withURX is powering will draw revenue for Fleksy. (Although he cautionedFleksy wont be flogging app install adds.)Other money-making opportunities, he said, will beunlocked over time thanks to the partnership, but some features will remain unmonetized and off-limits, existing only to enhance the user experience.Abig part of what is required [to be successful as a keyboard app] is to make sure that the experience doesnt feel crammed. There are a million different things you could add, but we first ask ourselves whether it makes sense and how auser can navigate a feature given the limited real estate of the app, Eleftheriou said.To give an idea of what is possible,he explained that Fleksy could partner e-commerce companies so that, when Fleksy users visit their website in a mobile browser, the keyboard app works with the retailers website to surface additional content like a second screen.Another potential  and fairly obvious  use case could be taxi apps, or any other services that use location.Fleksy can understandthecontext of a conversation so that if you arranged to meet a friend at a specific location, you canorder anUber at tap of button from your keyboard and the destination is already set based on thatconversation, Eleftheriou explained.To be clear, these integrations arent enabled yet and its still early days for Fleksys foray into services, but the fact that basicmessaging like SMS, iMessage and stock Android SMS apps are hugely popular in the U.S.  as opposed to Asia, where each country tends to have a dominant messaging app  gives Fleksy a unique vantage point as aplatform for value-added services.Suddenly a keyboard goes from a standalone tool to an entireutility kit at your fingertips, Eleftheriou said. Always relevant to the task at hand.
