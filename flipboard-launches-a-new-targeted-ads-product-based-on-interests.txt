Flipboard today is opening up some better targeting to its advertising partnersin the form of the advertising based on the interest graphs it has built for its users.Heres an example: an advertiser that chooses to advertise withcoffee topics may also have their ads shown with craft beer topics. The reason behind that, Flipboard head of advertising products DaveHuynh said, is that many of the same people who read stories about coffee also care about stories about craft beer.The advertiser may not have considered that relationship ahead of time, but what our data is telling you, thats the same kind of consumer youre interested in, Huynh said. The same person has similar interests, and theyre more likely to be in line with what you want to be your initial goal.Huynh said the goal for this kind of ad product was to essentially recreate the advertising experience that is seen in magazines  with high-quality ads being placed against content that might not be directly relevant, but is nonetheless related. Thatmore or less fits in line with Flipboards overall mission of emulating the magazine experience on a mobile device, he said.With this targeting, were able to bring our ads really close to the content and recreate this kind of relevant content and ad package on mobile, Huynh said. This is especially important at a time where bad ad experiences are being blocked, and as print circulation declines, were trying to pioneer a way to bring back an environment where everyone wins.For now, the pricing model is going to stay the same, Huynh said.Still, Flipboard isfinding itself competing with companies like Apple and Facebook (with new products like its Instant Articles), meaning it has to find a way to not only differentiate itself as a product, but also as a product for advertisers.This is clearly a step in that direction. By giving advertisers access to that more advanced data, it can woo them to use Flipboard over other curated products, which can then help it generate more revenue and continue to invest in its business.Flipboardearlier this year raised $50 million in a new financing round. The company says it has 80million monthly active users, with most of themreading onmobile devices.
