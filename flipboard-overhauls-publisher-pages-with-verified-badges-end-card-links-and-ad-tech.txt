Flipboard, the mobile and web app with some 82 million monthly active users who use the app toread content from around the web in a magazine-style layout,is todaytaking the wraps off a new version of its profile pages for publishers that includes new features like verified badges (a la Twitter),more monetizationrecirculation links (a la Taboola/Outbrain) and new ad tools. Itsan overhaul that shouldhelp those publishers sharpen up their presence in the app, but also help Flipboard make more ad revenue in the process.The list of changes is not short, and is the result of months of work involving visits to many of the 400 top publishers who post to Flipboard today, saidJack Mazzeo, the companys head of platform products. (Little side notes: Mazzeo  an alum ofco-founder Mike McCues Tellme Networks  only joinedFlipboard in May, perhapswith this overhaul in mind. Our sources had told us about some of these changes as they were being tested earlier this yearunder the name Pipes.)Some of the changes are being made to improve Flipboards usability. Following Twitters lead, Flipboard will now addverified badges to large publishers profiles, as well as the homepages of well-known individuals and brands.This will be in the form of a red squarewith a white check. These badges will first start to be rolled out to the 400 top publisher partners, before Flipboard will turn its attention to the tens of thousands of smaller publishers and others creating content on its platform, the company says.This is a sharpening of how Flipboard positionsitself as a platform for marketing these different entities. The whole purpose of is to make usersunderstand [the verified account] isa real source, said communications and marketing head Marci McCue,who says that, just as onTwitter, some of thebiggest names have picked up people posing as them.Flipboard will also (finally) give publishers a way of centralizing different feeds they may have for magazines onFlipboard into a single view. This is an important change, because in the past content was more siloed based on subjects as well as stories, news feeds and custom Flipboard Magazines.Creating a single homepagewas an important change to make because McCue says that publishers having been asking for more data about how their content is read on the site, and for more ways to grow that. This was one way to start improvingboth of those.There are other features that Flipboard is adding in a bid to grow more traffic:perhaps top of the list is a new feature Flipboard is calling End Cards. These are essentially recirculation tools, which will feature a mix of other articles from the publisher in question, mixed in with links to ads as well as Flipboards take on native ads  sponsored articles.McCue notes that while End Cards (example from our own account, pictured right) will now automatically appear at the end of every story, and that there is no way of opting out of them, for readers technically its relatively easy to ignore these by not flipping the page at the end of a story.However, Im assuming that just as the Flip action is so sticky, it will be hard for people to avoid these. And Flipboard says that their tests of these have shown them to lead people to reading more:15 percent of readers who have seenan End Card in its tests continue on and open another story.Behind the scenes, Flipboard is also ramping up in the kinds of features that its giving to publishers to improve their analytics on the site, and how they advertise on it.Publishers can now get unified numbers from comScore measuring their audience on the platform, and they can also get global views that will include Flipboard traffic alongside what they are seeing in their own apps and on the web. (Note: publishers will have to be subscribers of comScores Media Metrix service to get the full whack of data.)One of the things I heard from many publishers is that they wanted to represent the Flipboard audience in the same way that comScore represents audience, Mazzeo said, and the same goes for Google Analytics, whichFlipboard will now also integrate withto track traffic to their content from the Flipboard mobile apps.The reason for pulling in and tracking more numbers? Advertising, of course: the numbers will help both Flipboard and publishers make the case to advertisers that this is a platform where they want to be.Advertising is an area where Flipboard is also flipping the page: the company willnow workwith DoubleClick, via an integration withDoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), so that publishers cancreate and manage ad campaigns on Flipboard. In the past, publishers would have had to use Flipboards own tools to do this, which would have been more time-consuming and potentially a gating factor to running ads at all. Now, the idea will be that publishers that are already using DoubleClick to create and track ads on the web and elsewhere will be able to add Flipboard into the mix relatively easily.Flipboard would not say, however, what this might mean in terms of revenues: the company, McCue said, will continue to create and place ads on behalf of clients directly, and over time there may be more channels for ads created, such as direct links with larger ad agencies. All of these will result in different revenue splits for Flipboard, publishers, and any other party that happens to get involved.Regardless of how it getsthere, Flipboard has a pretty clear mandate right now: grow, grow, grow. The company raised $50 million earlier this year but at a flat valuation compared to its previous round. Others have noted that the company  once something of a startup darling for revolutionizing how content was read on mobile, in a beautiful and simple way  has been throughseveral failed acquisition attempts and seen some of the initial hype peter out.Flipboards fatehasnt been helped by executivedeparturesand the launch of several other services that directly compete with Flipboard. They include Apple News, but more importantly launches from places where people are already spending a lot of time online, like Facebook.
