The HTC One M9 isnt all that different from its predecessor the M8  it still has a premium though relatively thick design, but it upgrades in the camera department as well as in general processing speed. But does it stand out? Biggs feels that the One M9 isnt suited for the current competitive landscape, given the recent release of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge  he thinks that both of Samsungs latest flagships are the ultimate in Android hardware. But I think that HTC is poised to be a a real competitive alternative to Samsung gear for folks interested in a premium Android device, but perhaps looking for a lower price point.  Specs include a 5-inch 1080p display, an excellent 20-megapixel camera with a 4-megapixel front-facing camera, with a Snapdragon 810 quad-core processor under the hood. It runs Android 5.0 Lollipop, and goes for $199 on-contract. Two flies.
