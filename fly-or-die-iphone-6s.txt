Were back with a special TechCrunch Disrupt SF edition of Fly or Die,where we had an early preview of the new iPhone 6s.As is now routine with iPhone releases, the 6s is an off-year incremental upgrade, focusing on upgraded internals instead of exterior aesthetics.The most notable upgrade is probably therear-facing camera, which is now 12MP and capable of capturing 4K video. The 6s also has a Live Photos feature, which records a brief video clip from before and after a photo is taken.The 6s also incorporates 3D-Touch, which Apple first introduced in the Apple Watch. This feature allows the screen to measure different levels of pressure, which opens the door to a bunch of new interactions and shortcuts. For example, users can now press a little harder on the camera icon, pulling up options to directly openSelfie or Time-Lapse mode.In terms of upgraded performance, TechCrunch Editor-in-Chief Matthew Panzarino saw a 56.5 percent speed increase from the iPhone 6 Plus to the iPhone 6s Plus. This means that iOS 9 on the 6s is incredibly speedy, with none of the lag that some have seen on older devices running the new software.Overall, the new 6s may look familiar, but is a totally new beast. But will it Fly or Die?
