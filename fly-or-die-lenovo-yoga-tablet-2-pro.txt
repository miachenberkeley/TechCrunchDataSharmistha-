The Lenovo Yoga Tablet Pro 2, while long-winded in name, is pretty interesting when it comes to form and function. The kickstand-equipped tablet offers pretty standard capabilities, with a 13.3-inch (25601440) IPS display, an Intel Atom processor, 2GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal storage, and an added surprise. The 13-inch tablet also comes with a built-in pico projector so that you can blow out movies or presentations on a nearby wall. We brought the Yoga Tablet Pro 2 into the office for an episode of Fly Or Die, and to my shock and awe, John Biggs is impressed. He thinks the projector is a helpful addition to a tablet of this size, which could work well for travel or in-home use. Im not quite as wooed by the projector, which doesnt seem to work well in anything but pure darkness, and the UI that Lenovo slapped over the Android 4.4 tablet is a bit too bare bones. One fly and one die, meaning youll just have to check it for yourself. The Yoga Tablet Pro 2 is available now for $499.
