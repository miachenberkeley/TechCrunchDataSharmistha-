In December of last year, a new, mysterious phone entered the oligarchy of the smartphone world. It was called the OnePlus One, and it made a hell of a splash as one of the more capable indie phones of the year.More recently, the same company has followed up with a sequel, aptly naming it the OnePlus 2.In terms of specs, the phone has a 5.5-inch 1080p display, dual-SIM, and a 13-megapixel camera, with a Snapdragon 810 processor and up to 64GB of internal storage under the hood. It runs pure Android 5.1 Lollipop, with OnePluss own Oxygen UI overlay.As John would say, its completely separate from the mainstream, but that doesnt answer the question of superiority. For travelers, tinkerers, and folks who think different, the OnePlus 2 may very well be a solid option.The phone retails at around $400 for the 64GB version.
