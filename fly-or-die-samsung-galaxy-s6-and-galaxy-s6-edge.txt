The Samsung Galaxy S6, and its much prettier twin the Galaxy S6 Edge, are due on the market shortly as two of the most hotly anticipated Android phones out there. But do they live up to all the hype?John Biggs reviewed both devices and came away significantly impressed with the upgraded design, especially that of the Galaxy S6 Edge.The specs on the devices are nearly identical: 5.1-inch 14402560 Super AMOLED display, 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies, Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, and a quad-core Exynos chipset under the hood.But specs are only as good as the overall experience, and Biggs walked away more than pleased with the speed, usability and design of both phones. Hes specifically fond of the curved edges of the S6 Edges display, and believes the difference in design from the S6 to the S6 Edge is worth the extra $100.I, however, find the curved display edges to be a bit of a gimmick, though havent found immediate problems with the phone itself. Samsung has made big strides to offer a more premium-feeling device as opposed to past plastic-y smartphones. That said, Im not sure the curved glass is necessary.
