With the Apple Watch dominating the news cycle, its easy to forget about the smart(ish) watches that have come before it. But while intelligent time pieces will come and go, Im still deeply attached to my Withings Activit. The Activit is perhaps the only attractive smart watch. Apple Watch fans will blast me in the comments, but I maintain my stance: the Activit is a more stylish watch than the Apple Watch. That said, it has a fraction of the functionality. The Activit tracks your activity (shocker, I know), including distance traveled throughout the day and calories burn. The watch is also equipped with sleep tracking capabilities, as well as a vibration system to wake you up in the morning. The watch pairs with the Withings app, which also tracks information from other Withings devices such as the Withings smart scale. The Activit is a touch pricey ($400), but its a fine looking watch that has an old-school feel while still offering functionality youve come to expect out of an activity tracker. John doesnt like it, but hes a fanboi. \_()_/
