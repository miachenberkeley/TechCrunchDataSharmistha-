U.S. Senator Bill Nelson sent a letter to Google CEO Larry Page on Tuesday asking the company to detail how it selects content for the YouTube Kids application, and what steps Google is taking to ensure children are not being exposed to unsuitablecontent. The letter comesa couple of months after a number of consumer advocacy groups filed a complaint with theFederal Trade Commission (FTC) regardingthe way the app mixesads and entertainment, as well as a more serious charge filed in May.The more recent complaint alleged the YouTube Kids application was exposing children to inappropriate content, including references to sex, alcohol and drug use, child abuse, pedophilia and more.Nelson (D-Fla), as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over the FTC,addresses both of those issues in his letter. His follow-up questions are more concerned with YouTubes filtering mechanisms, however.Google released the YouTube Kids application in Februaryas a way to offer parents a curated selection of videos aimed at children. Its launch was initially promising  after all, parents for years have struggled with their kids happening upon adult content while surfing YouTube. But soon after its release, consumer groups began finding problems with the new app, which raised concerns.In April, nearly a dozen consumer groups including theCenter for Digital Democracy, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Consumer Watchdog, complained to the FTC that the YouTube Kids application mixed advertisementswith entertainmentin a way thats deceptive to children.Specifically, they noted that YouTube allowed videos where hosts likecartoon characters were allowed to sell products inside their shows. Plus, the app containeda number of branded channels like those for companies like Barbie or Fisher-Price, which the group called out as little more than program-length commercials.The groups also said that some user-generated segments that can befound on YouTube Kids are created by those who have business relationships with the product manufacturers, but fail to disclose this. This also violates FTC guidelines, theycomplained.In hisletter, Nelson reminds Google/YouTube thatads have to beclearly distinguished in online services aimed at children.In addition, the senatorsletterasks Google anumber of questions about how it selects, filters, and removes videos published to the YouTube Kids application.These arein response to a complaint filed with the FTC byCenter for Digital Democracy and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhoodlast month.The twojointlypublished areview of the YouTube Kids app, explaining that they were able to view videos that includedsexual language, unsafe behaviors like playing with matches or juggling knives, profanity (e.g. in a parody of the film Casino featuring Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street), adult discussions about family violence, pornography, and child abuse, jokes about drug use and pedophilia, and alcohol ads.Given Googles considerable technical expertise, Nelson writes, the company can presumably and readily deploy effective filtering tools to screen for unsuitable videos.Nelson asks Google to explain how its determining whats suitable for children, how it filters the videos, how it handles complaints about the videos in the app, how quickly it removes content thats flagged, and how it determines the suitability of ads, among other things.The letter also points to federal regulations that the YouTube Kids applicationmaybe violating.Section 5 of the FTC Act broadly prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices,' writes Nelson. Moreover, the FTC enforces the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires online services for children 12 years old and younger to acquire parental consent before collecting any online information.As parents seek out safe and appropriate online venues for their children, it is critical that services designed and marketed for children are, in fact, appropriate for the kids who will undoubtedly use them, he adds.Nelsonis the first senator to write to Google regarding the application, but hes not the only one to have expressed concerns. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who also serves on theSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and who authored COPPA, says that the issues the advocacy groups have raised call into question whether the app is actually kid-friendly.Google must demonstrate how it is keeping its promise to parents to safeguard our children online, Markey stated.The FTC hasnt yet provided a status report on its own inquiry.In building its Kids app, YouTube collaborated with Common Sense Media, ConnectSafely.org, the Family Online Safety Institute, the Internet Keep Safe Coalition (iKeepSafe) and WiredSafety.org. However,oneof the problems with the app is that its continually updated with new content that requires review, butits unclear how much Google leans on algorithms versus human curation to manage the influx. Plus,the app offers a search feature thats enabled by default, which could lead kids to unsuitable videos.There was no deadline on the letter Nelson sent to YouTube, but the senator expects a prompt response, were told. Google, meanwhile, has not yet provided comment.Update, 6/18/15: Google confirms it received the letter, but is declining to comment.06.16.15 Letter to Google Re YouTube Kids
