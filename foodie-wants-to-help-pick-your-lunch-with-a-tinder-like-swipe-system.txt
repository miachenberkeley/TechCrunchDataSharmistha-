Jeonguk Lee andJohn Kim are hoping a different spin on flipping through food reviews is going to help you decide where to eat for lunch.Its an app called Foodie, which thepair showed off at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 hackathon. It shows photos and Yelp reviews of various foods in the area, and users can swipe left and right to save the ones that look good.The goal then is to show how many people in the area also liked what showed up on the app.There are two goals here, Kim says: to figure out what people like to help better make a decision as to where to eat and to figure out what foods and restaurants are hot at the moment.Picking new or the best restaurants, even for lunch with friends, requires slogging through a huge list of reviews on sites like Yelp. This is a huge headache in general, and Kims hope is that this will be more lightweight by showing user-generated images and restaurants that start off with pretty good reviews.We want to know where other people are around the location and then be able to give them whats hot now, Kim said. Thats something Yelpdoesnt do; it shows you what was hot before, but it doesnt show whats trending now based on the weather. If its super hot, ice cream could be trending, for example.Up next, according to Kim, is hopefully a feature that lets a group of friends flip through food photos to decide what looks good and showing the group what the consensus best photo was. Its basically, were thinking of doing a chat room likeSlack. Think of this as a session and you invite your friends to this separately,and then when you go into it you see three people match and what all of us want.
