A year ago, privately held online lenders likeProsper, SoFi and Avant looked all but certain to go public at the same unicorn valuationstheir ventureinvestors had assigned them  if not higher. Theywere seeminglyreshaping the student, consumer and small business lending business. The market theyrechasing is enormous: The U.S. consumer lending market is a$3.5 trillion business, and 22 of the largest online marketplace platforms originatedjust more than$5 billion of unsecured consumer credit in 2014and more than$10 billion in 2015.They also talked a big game. When SoFi raised a whopping $1 billion from Softbank last year, CEO Michael Cagney told Bloomberg: Im looking at over $1 trillion of market cap from the banks, and I think its all vulnerable.Fast forward to today, and its online lenders thatsuddenly look like sitting ducks.In an SEC filing yesterday, Lending Club, whichannounced the surprise departure of its founder and CEO last Monday, revealed that investors who contributed a significant amount of funding for loans are now examining that performance or are otherwise reluctant to invest.Thats a huge problem.Lending Club cant originate a loan until it has sold it to another party.Its not just Lending Club thats grownoverly reliant on institutional sources of capitalto keep its business afloat, though the problem is just becoming widely understood now.For many casual observers in Silicon Valley, the first signs of trouble in the online lending category emerged in late April, when the WSJ reported that Avantmade $514 million worth of new loans in the U.S. in the first quarter, a 27 percent drop from the fourth quarter of 2015. Then, two weeks ago, Prosper confirmed that it planned to cut roughly 28 percent of its staff in response to falling loan volume. And Prospers news came just a day after OnDeck Capital said its own first-quarter losses had more than doubled as demand for its loans began to nosedive.Of course, the kicker camelast week, when Lending Club CEO Renaud LaPlanche resignedfollowing an internal audit that turned up $22 million in loans that were soldto Jefferies yet didnt meet the investment banks criteria.Fast growth, big risksIf the shift in the companies fortunes seemed abrupt to Silicon Valley, it wasnt a surprise to many in the financial industry. Theyll tell you theyve seen this movie before.Online lending grew incredibly quickly from loan volumes of almost nothing eight years ago to many billions of dollars a year, says Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners, a merchant banking firm in New York. But what started out as a disruptive movement known as peer-to-peer was far more novel than what it became, which, in many cases, is a front for whoever is providing [some of these startups with]capital to lend.Think banks like Goldman SachsandJefferies. Think hedge funds and insurance companies.The obvious benefit of taking capital from larger institutions isthat theyallow online lendingcompanies to grow, and quickly. While companies operating in this space come with inherent advantages  they use automated loan applications; theyhave no retail branches; they use electronic data sources and tech-enabled underwriting models that help them to quickly identify a borrowers credit risk  having deep-pocketed friends has madeother things easier. Among them is being able to provide funding decisions within 48 to 72 hours, and to offer small loans with short-term maturities.Until recently, Wall Street has happily obliged. And why wouldnt it?With interest rates so low for so long, these new lending productshave been an attractive place to generate revenue. Some online lenders have charged more than60 percent in annual interest on their loans, including origination fees.In fact,the rates provided these institutions were sometimes so steepthat the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the State of California began lookinginto these businesses last year out of concern over whether online lenders are treating consumers fairly.Next stepsJudging by a lengthy white paper published by Treasury last week, slightly moreregulation is coming, includingadditionalsafeguards to protect small borrowers, as well as standardized and clearer terms and disclosures to borrowers.The government also seems interested in ensuring that online marketplace lenders expand beyond serving prime and near-prime consumer borrowers to those who are creditworthy, but may not be scoreable under traditional credit scoring models.While online lenders might be relieved that Treasury doesnt appearintent on aggressive changes (for now),a much bigger concern for themis a market that now realizes how fragile online lenders business models really are, notes Todd Baker of Broadmoor Consulting, a consulting firm to the financial services industry.As he notes,it just took oneblip in the capital markets last summer for this to become clear, when thebanks, hedge funds and other institutionsgrew nervous about risk. Online lenders couldnt give them better rates on loan sales while staying profitable, so these investorsstarted looking for greener pastures, notes Bakerand theyre continuing to pull back.Wall Street walks when it gets nervous, says Baker.Thats not just bad news for publicly traded companies. So-called unicornlendersincludingProsper, which has raised $355 million from investors and was valued at $1.9 billion as of April 2015; SoFi, which has raised roughly $1.4 billion altogether at an implied valuation of between $3 billion and $5 billion; and Avant, which has raised $654 million at a valuation north of $1 billion suddenly look like long shots as upcoming IPO candidates.In fact, consolidation in the industry, where other still-private players include Kabbage, Funding Circle, Earnest, Affirm andCommonBond(among dozens of others), now seems all but inevitable.Smartly, some players are already looking to reimagine themselves as broader financial outfits.For example, SoFi, which began as a way for students from top universities to refinance their debt,has since branched into personal loans, wealth management and mortgages. It alsosaid last month that itshoping to drum up more investor demand for the debt it originates by starting a hedge fund that will buy its own loans.Bakerexpects that to survive and thrive, moreonline lenders may need to remodel themselves into the institutions they vowed to replace, either by becoming banks, buying or selling to banks, or elsestriking uppartnerships with banks.OnDeck andJPMorgan made one such pact.Last month, JPMorgan quietly beganoffering online loans to its existing small-business customers using OnDecks technology.Indeed, there is a silver lining, and itsthat huge market opportunity. The trick for online lenders will be finding new ways to pursueit while remaining viable businesses.As notes Wolff, the economist, online lenders are a part of the future. But theWeb 2.0 model has been to ask for forgiveness, not permission, and the financial space is way too heavily regulated for that to a be a strategy.Dangerous is cool when youre in high school, he says of online lendersdependence on fickle institutional investors.When youre in the money business? Not so much.
