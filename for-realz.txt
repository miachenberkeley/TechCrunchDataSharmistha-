Tesla is coming off of a rough earnings day, but that didnt stop the company from showing off some awesome stuff.Today, the company tweeted out a demo of something its founder and CEO Elon Musk has talked about before. At the time it sounded crazy, as most of Musks ideas do.@elonmusk pic.twitter.com/T6WXHyQ4L4 drew olanoff (@drew) December 31, 2014But here it is. Its a charging station and technique that looks like its straight out of a science-fiction movie.Hit the play button and watch it all the way through. The snakey charging arm (called the Solid Metal Snake) makes its way to the parked Tesla Model S car automatically. No human intervention.Charger prototype finding its way to Model S.

Feel free to do the same:What did we learn today, class? When Elon says his company is working on something, his company is working on something. I wonder if the potential Tesla self-driving car fleet is for realz too?
