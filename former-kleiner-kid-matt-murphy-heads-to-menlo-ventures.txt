According to Murphy, he was attracted to his new by having already knownthe team, and generally speaking, Menlo having fund size and cadence that match his prior investment patterns.That sounds like standard boilerplate, and it must be to some category, but Murphy was emphatic in his excitement to work with Menlo Ventures. The current venture market, akin to the tech blogger market, is hot at the moment, with movement between firms.Murphy told TechCrunch that while he will maintain a focus on enterprise-facing investments, he may spend more time on consumer-facing startups.Its a rich moment in the market, and it will be interesting to see what hits Murphy can bring home to his new team.
