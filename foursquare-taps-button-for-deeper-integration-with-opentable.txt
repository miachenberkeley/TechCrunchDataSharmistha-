Foursquare is getting a touch closer to OpenTable through deeper integrations via Button.Users on the Foursquare app will now be able to see available tables (from OpenTable) right within the Foursquare app, as well as have the ability to book tables.Button, which helps different applications work more seamlessly together, is powering the integration.Foursquare has already taken steps to make its recommendations app a one-stop shop for finding out what you want to do. For example, Foursquare partnered with Uber back in June (also via Button) to allow users to order an Uber directly within the app once they found a bar or restaurant that was worth checking out.With todays integration, users could theoretically find a restaurant, book a table, and then order an Uber to handle transportation without ever having left the main Foursquare app.
