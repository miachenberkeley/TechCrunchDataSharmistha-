Frame.io today launched Frame.io for Adobe Premiere Pro, an extension that will enable video editors to use thevideo collaboration tool inside the video-editing program.When Frame.io CEO Emery Wells asked me to join the beta program for the companys Premiere extension, I jumped at the chance.The ability torespond to changes from within Premiere while editing creates a more efficient workflow. For example, it enables me toexport directly from my edit sequence to Frame.io and add collaborators easily.After using Frame.io for Premiere Profor the past month Ive been really impressed. Frame.io has really nailed the experience and the functionality that editors need and want.After installing the extension I barely use the actual web application anymore. I can export and upload with one click, which is my most used functionality.The Premiere extension is perfect for editors,andthe web application is great for customers/clients. The two work really well together.Ive been usingFrame.io since it first came out in October. Over that time Ive gotten the entire TechCrunchvideo team on board with the platform, because it is just such a better alternative to products like Dropbox, Box or Google Drive. And its built by editors specifically for editors.Every key click and mouse move counts, so anything that reduces steps that I have to gather feedback, distribute media and collaborate with people across the country is something that is needed in my profession. In short, I probably use Frame.io every single day.The company made a pretty snazzy video to highlight the features in the Adobe Premiere extension. Check it out below.
