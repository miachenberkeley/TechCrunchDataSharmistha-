Fred Wilson is a name that needs no introduction, but were going to do it anyway.TechCrunch is excited to announce that Fred Wilson will be speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt New York, which goes down May 9 through May 11, in a fireside chat.Fred is a veteran at TechCrunch Disrupt New York, which makes sense given his contribution to the growth of the New York tech scene over the past 20 years.Starting out as an associate at Euclid Partners, Fred has gone on to start Flatiron Ventures and Union Square Ventures, where he is currently founder and managing partner. His investments include Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga, Etsy, Disqus, and many more.He sits on the boards of a number of companies, including DonorsChoose, Kik and Etsy.Though Freds resume speaks for itself, that doesnt stop him from approaching on-stage discussions with brute honesty.He isnt afraid to tell startups what will and wont work. In fact, as a Battlefield Finals Judge at Disrupt 2014, Fred told Battlefield winner Vurb: Your problem is a bitch. You wont solve it and it will kill you.Hows that for blunt?Theres always a lesson to be learned from Fred, and those of us who read his daily blog know there is plenty of wisdom to be garnered from listening to what he has to say.Were more than thrilled to see what Fred has in store for us this year  he promised to make sure its not the traditional VC stuff  and we hope you can join us to see him speak.Buy tickets to Disrupt here.Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
