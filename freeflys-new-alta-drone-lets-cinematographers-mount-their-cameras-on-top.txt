Freefly is best known for its MoVI camera stabilizers, but the company started out with aerial cinematograhy, and while it hasnt focused on it all that much lately, its long offered a professional drone, too. At this years NAB show, Freefly is returning to the drone market with the Freefly Alta, a ready-to-fly, multi-rotor platform for aerial cinematographers.The Alta is unabashedly a tool for pros, but the company also wanted it to be easy to use. It shouldnt take more than five minutes to get the Alta out of its custom (and included) Pelican case and up in the air.Obviously, there are plenty of ready-to-fly drones on the market, but whats probably the Altas standout feature is that not only can youmount the camera underneath the drone but also on top.This will allow cinematographers to get shots that werent previously possible and as far as I am aware, this is the first drone to feature this capability.The Alta can carry a payload of up to 15 pounds, enough to carry a RED Epic or the upcomingARRI Alexa Miniand gimbal. With the gimbal and camera attached, the drone should be able to stay aloft for up tofifteen minutes.Freefly also tells me that the company developed its own flight controller for the Alta that combines years of fine-tuning and experience with the third-party controllers that were needed to power the companys older drones.Besides the Alta, Freefly is also launching a couple of new products around its MoVI line. These include a new MoVI stabilizer for large cameras  the aptly named MoVI XL. But Freeflysmost interesting new tool for cinematographersis probably the MIMIC.Using the MIMIC, a camera man can follow an actor while the director can hold the MIMIC controller and tilt, pan and roll the camera. That sounds a bit abstract, but this video shows why thats actually pretty cool in practice.
