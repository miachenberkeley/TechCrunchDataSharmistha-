The FTC has raised concerns about the complexity and privacy risks posed by the rise of an Internet of Things, with some 25 billion connected objects predicted to be online in 2015, and so-called smart home devices predictedto number around25 million this year.Concerns about privacy could encourage consumer mistrust of IoT devices, the FTC has warned, having a knock-on impact on consumer adoption. To avoid that scenario it has detailedsome of themeasures it thinks IoTcompanies should take to mitigate privacy risks.FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez was speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, after touring the show floor where exhibitors are showing off a swatheof connected objects they hope consumers will be installing in their homes in future.[The Internet of Things]has the potential to provideenormous benefits for consumers, but it also has significant privacy and security implications, warnedRamirez.Connected devices that provide increased convenience and improve health services are alsocollecting, transmitting, storing, and often sharing vast amounts of consumer data, some of ithighly personal, thereby creating a number of privacy risks.Key privacy and security challengesShewent on to detail threeparticular privacychallengesthatcompaniesin the IoT space will needto grapple with  namely:(1) ubiquitous data collection; (2) the potential for unexpected uses ofconsumer data that could have adverse consequences; and (3) heightened security risksUbiquitous data collection refers to the cumulative impact of multiple sensing and tracking technologies, which  working in symphony  could sketch adeeply personal and startlingly complete picture of each of us, saidRamirez, with the massive volume of collected data allowing analysis that generates additional sensitive inferences.Connected devices are also increasingthe sensitivity of the data collected,as sensors and devices find their way into the most intimate spaces in our lives: our homes, our cars, and even onto our bodies. Connected devices are effectively allowing companies to digitallymonitor our otherwise private activities, she noted.Then there is the worry about unexpected uses of collected personal data. So, rather than being used to enhance the experience of the particular product a consumerbought, the data a connected device harvestsmight be funneled off elsewhere  and be used by prospect employers to judge the merits of ajob application, for instance, or insurance companies to ascertain the risk of accepting a new customer,and so on.As businesses use the vast troves of data generated by connected devices to segmentconsumers to determine what products are marketed to them, the prices they are charged, and thelevel of customer service they receive, will it exacerbate existing socio-economic disparities? saidRamirez.We cannot continue down the path toward pervasive data collection without thinkinghard about all of these questions, she added.On the security point, she discussed the risk ofconnected objects becoming targets forhackers, and the proliferation of connected devices bothincreasing the number of entry points intruders can attack andthe seriousness of any hacking incident, givenso much sensitive data is now being connected.She noted:Data security is already challenging, as evidenced by the growing number of high profilebreaches with which we are all familiar. But security in an IoT world is likely to present unique challenges. As an initial matter, some of the developers entering the IoT market, unlikehardware and software companies, have not spent decades thinking about how to secure theirproducts and services from hackers.And, the small size and limited processing power of manyconnected devices could inhibit encryption and other robust security measures.Moreover, someconnected devices are low-cost and essentially disposable. If a vulnerability is discovered onthat type of device, it may be difficult to update the software or apply a patch  or even to getnews of a fix to consumers.Baking security and privacy into connected devicesTo counter these challenges, the FTC is hoping IoT companies will adopt specific practices  and bake them into their business models  aimed atenhancing privacy and security, and bolstering consumer trust in their own products, and the IoT market as a whole.The three measures set out byRamirez are:(1) adopting security bydesign; (2) engaging in data minimization; and (3) increasing transparency and providingconsumers with notice and choice for unexpected data usesOn the security by design point, as well as prioritizing security and building it into devices from the outset, she said companies should conduct a privacy or security risk assessment as part of the design process; test security measures before a product is launched; use smart defaults (such as passwords that require consumers to change them on set-up); consider encryption; and monitor products throughout their life cycle and patch any known vulnerabilities.There should also be designated people within companies who are responsible for security in the organization.In other words, all pretty standard and sensible security procedures whichlarger companies may already be practicing.However startup businesses, with their limited resources and impetus to speed newproducts to market while they are still disruptive, may well cut corners here. And therein lies another risk for the IoT as startups crowd in to rushtheirsmart home devices into a nascent market. Those security standards are going to slip.Ramirez also discussed the importance of practicing data minimization. Which again potentially conflicts with the typical startup playbook. Grabbing as much data as you can to mine for future intel to monetizeyour free service is a common startup modus operandi, but not one that meshes naturally with the idea of collecting the minimum data possible, only for the specific product purpose and then discarding it as soon as possible afterwards. Thats what the FTC wants for the IoT, and thats not how scores of startups operate. So another conflict lurks.Collecting and retaining large amounts of datagreatly increases the potential harm that could result from a data breach.We often hear the argument that to realize the benefits of big data, businesses should notface limits on the collection and retention of data because the value lies in its unanticipated uses, she said. But I question the notion that we must put sensitive consumer data at risk on the off-chance acompany might someday discover a valuable use for the information.I agree that we need more dialogue on acceptable and unacceptable uses of consumerdata. But I continue to believe that reasonable limits on data collection and retention are anecessary first line of protection for consumers, she added.She did discussde-identifying consumer data as one possible compromise, although she also noted there is a risk of re-identification, adding that sound technical strategiesfor making data anonymous should be coupled with administrative safeguards. She also reiterated the FTCs view thatcompanies should publicly commit not to seek to re-identify dataand, through contract, should also require the same commitment from those with whom they share data.Finally she stressed the importance of clarity, transparency and choice when it comes to the unexpected uses scenario  which looks likely to be an emergent property of the data mountain generated by the IoT. Sothat meansclear notice providedto consumers, accompanied bysimplified choices for any unexpected collection of theirdata.Specifically, thatmeans giving consumers the ability to consent (or not)when an IoT company is proposing sharing theirdata with a third party, and notification that is absolutelynot embedded within a lengthy privacy policy or T&C agreement which does no getread.Rather the FTC wantssuch notifications tobe specifically flagged up, however challenging that might be for connecteddevice designers.In other words if your connected kettle business wants to sell intel to the local supermarket on how many cups of tea a particularuser of its shop drinks per day, well the kettle itself is going to need to find a way toask its owner nicely.I recognize that providing notice and choice in an IoT world is easier said than done. Connected devices may have little or no interfaces that readily permit choices. And we risk inundating consumers with too many choices as connected devices and services proliferate. But in my mind, the question is not whether consumers should be given a say over unexpected uses of their data; rather, the question is how to provide simplified notice and choice, Ramirezadded.
