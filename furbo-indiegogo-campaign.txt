Furbo, created by startup Tomofun, gives owners a new way to interact with their dogs while away from home.The camera allows you to keep an eye on your dog, with two-way audio so that you can also talk to them and make them feel a little less alone. There are even push notifications that tell you when your dog is barking.Other startups also make pet cameras, so what really sets Furbo and Tomofun apart is the ability to launch dog treats from the camera.Furbo is currently available a pre-order price of $99 through Tomofuns Indiegogo campaign, where it has already raced past its $50,000 target. The plan is to start shipping in July.
