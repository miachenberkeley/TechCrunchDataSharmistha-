Samsung announced its thinnest smartphone to date last week  thats the Galaxy A8  and today the Korean firm took the wraps off its thinnest tablet devices so far: the Galaxy Tab S2.Like last years Galaxy Tab S, design is a big focus for these two devices. And, at just5.6mm, they aremore slender than Apples sleekest iPad Air (6.1mm). They are available in two new sizes  8 inch and 9.7 inch  which weigh in at just 265g and 389g, respectively. That combination of thinness and weight could make them pretty portable devices.TheGalaxy Tab S was impressive, and it shone brightest when it came to multimedia, particularly watching videos and films. It looks to be the same story again with these upcoming models.Samsungs press materials also play up the ease of reading media on the2048 x 1536 pixel super AMOLED display,though well reserve full judgment until weve had a chance to get theminto our hands for a deepertest.On the specs side of things, the Galaxy Tab S2 runs Android 5.0 Lollipop. Under the hood itis powered by an octo-core processor, which pairs four1.9GHz cores with four1.3GHz cores  with 3GB RAMand 32 or64GB of internal memory. The latter is expandable to 128GB via microSD cards.Media-wise, the tablets sport an 8-megapixel rear camera and2.1-megapixel front camera. Thats not bad for a tablet, but wed still rather see people taking photos and video on their phone or  god forbid  a dedicated camera, rather than bungling around with an oversizeda tablet.Samsung said theSamsung Galaxy Tab S2 will go on sale across the world in August. It looks like the models will be available in white and black, but Samsung hasnt saidhow much they will cost.
