Navigation system turned wearable manufacturer Garmin debuted a new running watch today that packs in a slew of tracking tools. The high-end Forerunner 735XT features built-GPS tracking, along with built-in heart-rate monitoring, the latter of which presents a number of available analytics, including the users Suffer Score.Strava, the company behind that last bit of analytics, defines the number as how hard you try, a welcome change that most users likely havent been evaluated on since elementary school.When you provide Strava with your heart rate data and train with a heart rate monitor, well rank every activity with a Suffer Score, according to the companys site. That score is based on the time you spend in different heart rate zones compared with your maximum heart rate. The deeper you dig, the longer you can hold on, the higher the Suffer Score.For those seeking moreconcrete numbers, the watch offers analytics for a wide range of activities, including cycling, swimming, hiking, cross-country skiing, strength training, and cardio  among others, toggling between sports with the press of a button. The watch is also compatible with a chest strap that offers even more data, including stride length and vertical ratio.The Forerunner 735XT promises 16 hours of training life on a charge. It starts at $450 (with a couple of additional bundles available) and is available for purchase now.
