GE announced today that it was expanding its Predix Internet of Things platform to provideInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS).The IaaS market is dominated by Amazon Web Services with many others, including Microsoft, Google and IBM vying for a piece of the action. GE hopes todifferentiate itself from these companiesby offering infrastructure services specifically tuned to the needs of industrial customers.GE manufactures large equipment like jet engines, wind turbines and locomotives. Thesemachines are loaded with sensors generatingan enormousamount of information. Predix was originally created as a Platform as a Service to allow customers and third-party developers to build applications to take advantage of all thedata coming from those sensors.With todays announcement, the company will be providinginfrastructure services to run those applications.In many ways, this approachresembles the IBM cloud strategy. IBMbought Softlayer in 2013, then launchedthe Bluemix development platform the following year with the hopethat developers willcreate applications on Bluemix and run them on Softlayer.While Harel Kodesh, CTO of GE Software, acknowledged that there are similarities between the two companies approaches, when you dig into the catalogue of services that GE offers to developers, youll find a much more focusedset of services devoted to the Internet of Things, he explained.As you might expect, Kodesh says one of the main selling points for going with the GE infrastructure offering, is that it plays nicely with the software developmentpart of the platform. In addition,the security layer has been designed specifically to meet the needs of companies running highly sensitive industrial equipment.One otherkey differentiating factor is that GE understands acutely howthese large pieces of equipment work because it built them. This means that Predix canprocess the huge amount of data these devices generate, and alsobetter predict the impact a given set of datawill have on the equipmentbased on factors like temperature, workload,and what materials the various parts are made of.Kodesh saidthat the Predix platform generated$4 billion in software revenue last year, and the company seesadditional revenue opportunities with the infrastructure offering.He was careful not to criticize other IaaS vendors, but simply pointed out that they are typically designed for consumers or for generalIT requirements.GE actually uses Amazon Web Services internally, but when it came to the Predix platform, the company decided to build its own because customerswere demanding a cloud solution built by an industrial player for industrial players, Kodesh said. In other words, theywere looking for a vendor that understood their specific needs.GE is far from alone in the IoTmarket. In fact, last springIBM launched its own Internet of Things initiative, which included a massive $3 billion investment. Other large companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also looking at various aspects of the Internet of Things,but GEhasthe advantage of being a manufacturer of large industrial equipment and all that entails  andits trying to builda platform to meet the requirementsof industrial customers.
