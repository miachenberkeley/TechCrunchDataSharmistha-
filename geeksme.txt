Spanish smartphone maker Geeksphone, perhaps best know for its partnership with Silent Circle over the pro-privacy Android fork Blackphone, is expanding from handsetsinto fitness wearables.The company has today teased a forthcoming fitness tracker bracelet (its first such device), called GeeksMe, which will have a circular,monochrome OLED display with12 bi-color LEDS around it.Geeksphone tells TechCrunch the tracker iscurrently in development and its hoping tolaunch it before the Spanish summer holidays aka bythe end of June, beginning of July.Along with the usual fitness tracker feature-set of step counter, calories burned and distance, it will also dosleep monitoring, andexpand incoming smartphone message/call notifications to thewrist. Plus you get alarms and reminders, so will be able to set custom activity reminders (for instance). So far so relatively standard wearable.However GeeksMewill also include twoless commonly found features in what is a very crowded space: namely ecologicalfootprint tracking, for the environmentally conscious.And, well, for the performance anxious, a sex tracker. Yep: quantifying your sex life is apparently a desirable thing.Now, as we noticedback in 2013, existing fitness trackers canbe used to garner data on sexual activity (via keeping tabs on factors such as heart rate and skin perspiration, and cross referencing those with the lack of any steps taken). ButGeeksMe wont betracking your under-the-sheets activities with the help of any especially fancysensors.Rather the sex trackermode will apparentlyrequire manual activationby the usereach time you want it to track your bed-based action.(Youll presumably have to hopeyour partner doesnt mind you pausing to switchyour wearable into lover performancemode. Not a mood kill at all )Its not based on heart rate. But it will have a special mode (similar to sleep mode) that once its activated will measure things like number of times a day/week, duration, calories burned, and other very useful information based on different algorithms we are developing,saysGeeksphones ngel Snchez Daz, who is director of innovation for the GeeksMe project.It will help users to have a healthier lifestyle, monitoring different values and statistics when practicing sex.The eco-tracking modewillmake use ofGPS location (via a Bluetooth linkedsmartphone, as there is no GPS on board the bracelet)anddaily fitness activity with additional info that is addedmanually by the user such as recycling, food and water consumption. Presumably there will be some sort of score kept to encourage users to gamify reducing their environmental impact.Theres no word on price for the wearableat this point but Snchez Daz says Geeksphone intends toundercut thewristbands of the Top-10 brands in the market.The design of the devicehas also not yet been finalized but Geeksphoneis emphasizing fashion as another priorityfor its first wearable  which will arrive in the market in the wake ofApples also fashion-focused (and long trailed) Apple Watch, which isdue to ship in April.Apples smartwatchhas the best chance of kindling mass market interest in wearables which have remained of relatively niche interest thus far. So expect scores moresmall fish to try their hand with wearables once the Apple Watch lands.
