Gemalto, the SIM card maker thatreportedly had its encryption keys stolen by the NSA and GCHQ, has claimed that its products are secure, despite apparent leaked NSA documents suggesting otherwise.The Amsterdam-based companyis putting on a brave, if defiant, face. In a statementissued today, it said initial investigations showed its products to besecure:Initial conclusions already indicate that Gemalto SIM products (as well as banking cards, passports and other products and platforms) are secure and the Company doesnt expect to endure a significant financial prejudice.Well know more about those exact findingson Wednesday. The company has scheduled a press conference in Paris starting at10:30 am local time that day, at whichitwilldiscuss its full investigation in more detail.Gemaltoreportedly produces over 2 billion SIM cards per year and works with more than600 operators worldwide. The company admitted last week that it was unaware that British and U.S. spying agencies had penetrated its encryption, potentially allowing them to accessinformation from millions of mobile users whohave itsSIM cards in their phones.The Intercept, the news organization run by Glenn Greenwald and backed by Pierre Omidyars First Look Media, brokethe news last week based on leaks from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.The report, and others that followed it,prompted a backlash from Dutch PMs, who demanded further details, whileprivacy advocates weighed in on the importance of the leak.Speaking to TechCrunch last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundations Mark Rumold said the disclosure was incredibly significant.NSA and GCHQ basically have the keys to decrypting mobile communications anywhere in the world, even without the participation of local communication carriers (which, even if not much, acts as some check on intelligence agency behavior). Its the equivalent of these agencies having printed doorkeys for the front doors to millions or even billions of homes around the world, just in case they one day decided they needed to get in. Frankly, people should have no faith in the security of global mobile communications, headded.Gemalto may want to believe it can move on, but itsbusiness is already showing signs of issues.Australias telecom operators are investigating the revelations, and may order a mass recall of SIM cards in response to security concerns.Mud sticks, and youd imagine that it will take more than a self-prescribed all clear from the companys internal report toremove the doubt that will exist in the minds of the industry and consumers.
