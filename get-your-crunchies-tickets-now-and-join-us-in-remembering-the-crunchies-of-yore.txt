The 9th Annual Crunchies are a little over a month away, and were gearing up to make this show one of the best ones yet.In the lead up to the Crunchies, we thought itd be fun to take a trip down memory lane and revisit some of the Crunchies of yesteryear to see what the startup and tech scenes were like in the past. In this piece, well look at the second and third Crunchies shows in 2008 and 2009, respectively.One constant in the first three Crunchies was Facebook. The social network scored a hat trick by taking the Best Overall Startup or Product award three years in a row. During that time period (and still today, in all honesty), Facebook innovated and added new features at a staggering rate, and that innovation paid off big at Crunchies time.Many of the startups and apps that won awards at these shows are no longer around. Perhaps most notably, Google Reader was named the Best Application or Service at the Second Crunchies in 2008, but Google killed the popular service in 2013.A few other winners and runners up were gobbled up by Facebook, including Gowalla (Runner Up for Best Mobile Application at the 3rd Crunchies) and FriendFeed (Winner of the Best new Startup of 2008 award), which are both now part of Zucks growing army.Looking back, perhaps the most interesting choice was Google Wave, which was selected as the runner up in the Best Technology Achievement category. I think we all kind of know how that turned out, and while the service was indeed pretty neat for a while, I dont think anyone felt too bad about waving goodbye to Google Wave in 2010.Other notable winners from this era included GitHub (Best Bootstrapped Startup  2nd Crunchies), Evernote (Best Mobile Startup  2nd Crunchies), Dropbox (Best Internet Application  3rd Crunchies) and Foursquare (Best Mobile Application  3rd Crunchies).Which startups and founders will take home a Crunchie at the 9th Annual Crunchies on February 8, 2016 at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco?
