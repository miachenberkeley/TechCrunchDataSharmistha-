It was only a matter of time and frankly not that much time  before a developer stepped in tomake it super simple for iPhone 6s/6s Plus users to spread their Live Photos all over the Internets as animated GIFs.After all, whats the point of having clips of your cat/kid doing cute stuff if theyre mostly languishingon your camera roll, rather than helping populate Giphy et al?Live Photos, for those in need of a quick primer, isa photo feature specific toApples latest smartphones which let users snap a picture and simultaneously record a short video clip.In the iPhone 6s/6s Plus camera roll these photos remain still and composed, until you view the shot and push your finger down on thepressure-sensitive screen at which point the photocomes to life, running through its brief animation, like so (albeit, on the iPhone they also have audio)Live Photos are only available on the latest iPhone models. So thatmeans sharing these clips withpeople who havent stumped up cash for shiny new Apple kit is tricky (but possible).Live GIF is the just launched app thats stepping into the breach to make it easier to share your animated shots in the webs favorite shareable video format (aka animated GIFs). Expect lots more to follow.The developer behind Live GIFalso makes the photo-editing app Priime. CEOArthur Chang says the idea with Live GIF was to experiment with 3D Touch and iPhone 6s capabilities  as well as building a really easy app that just does what everyone wants with Live Photos.We originally created this with iOS 9.1, because working with Live Photos is well documented and supported, but we decided to go further and push to get it working with iOS 9.0 so we wouldnt have to wait for 9.1 to come out of beta, he adds.With something this elemental and obvious speed is clearly of the essence  yknow, before the hordes rushinAnd Live GIF is certainlyreally easy to use.Heres how it worksFirst you need to have taken some Live Photos to giffinate. So locate your child/cat and get snapping (if you havent already).Albeit, as the saying goes, never work with children or animalsNext load the Live GIF app, which will automatically pull in only your Live Photos to its camera roll. Here you can tap on an individual shot to generate a preview of it in GIF form  with the option to Share GIF or Share video (as a .mov file) at that point.Your GIFs (or .movs) can be saved or shared via email, messaging apps and so on.And thats basically it. Your Live Photos (sans their audio) cannow be liberated from your iPhonehardware in GIF form.The app also offers users the option to open their photo to edit in Priime, as a way for the developers to push usersfrom app one to the other.The link between Priime and Live GIF is that its the start of us starting to explore things like 3D Touch for better control for editing photos, says Chang. Though its not editing anything just yet, that will be in Live GIF as we explore adding it to Priime as well.So for $1.99 iPhone 6s/6s Plus userscan share theirLive Photos as animated GIFs, with the rest of the GIF-loving Internet.Assuming the Internet needs any more cat GIFsYou can check out Live GIF on the App Store here.
