Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Recently I had the opportunity to catch up with Gil Penchina, founderatFlight.vc, the man behind the largest AngelList Syndicate and the network containing some the largest AngelList syndicates.In what turned out to be a thought provoking interview we discussed a range of topics including howGil built the largest AngelListsyndicate and enticed so many entrepreneurs to join his syndicate;why traditionalventure models are broken and how AngelList canprove as a disruptive solution to this 60 year old unchanged model of venture.Penchina also discussed how investors add value andwhat startups should look for in their investors.For Penchina, the next decade will see the creation of a more democratic venture capital and early stage investment industry, and Flight is at the forefront.
