The Gillmor Gang  Dan Farber, Frank Radice, Keith Teare, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Thursday, April 21, 2016. The sudden death of the Artist Forever Known as Prince reverberates across generations, decades, and the melting pot of pop, soul, funk, and rock and roll. As the presidential race settles into a social media-led micro-messaging revolution, were in for a summer of partying like its 1999.
