Giphy Cam, the app that lets you create and share your own GIFs with a few clicks, is today unveiling its first featured content layer in the form of Star Wars overlays.In other words, users can add Storm Trooper helmets and Light Sabers, among many more Star Wars-themed overlays, to their GIFs in an instant.Giphy Cam launched back in August of this year with a simple goal: to make GIFs as easy to create as they are to find and share from Giphy proper.The Giphy Cam app has no main feed, but is rather meant to act as a GIF creation tool, where users can capture a few frames or a full-fledged video and add crazy overlays and filters. The app then compresses the content into a .GIF file (or leaves it as a looping video if you wish to share on Instagram video) and the deed is done.The company even launched the ability to upload existing camera roll photos and videos to create GIFs within the app, which debuted this fall.But the introduction of Star Wars content marks a new page in the Giphy Cam playbook.Queen Glitter Bomb Julie Logan, who joined Giphy when the betaworks-backed company purchased her startup Nutmeg, says that no cash exchanged hands as part of the Star Wars deal. Rather, the move was meant to acquire new users through the sharing of GIFs through various Star Wars distribution channels.Star Wars: The Force Awakens isnt open in theaters until December 18, but the updated Star Wars-sprinkled Giphy Cam is available now for download.
