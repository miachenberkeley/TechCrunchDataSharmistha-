GitHub, the software development collaboration and version control service based on the popular open sourceGit tool, today announced that it has raised a $250 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and Institutional Venture Partners also participated in this round.The company, which was founded back in 2008, has now taken a total of $350 million in outside funding. While the company isnt talking about its valuation, the WSJ reports that its currently hovering around $2 billion. GitHubs2012 Series A round was led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the companysvaluation was said to be around $750 million.As GitHub CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath told me shortly after the new round was announced, the company plans to use this new round to accelerate growth and expand its sales and engineering team (as most companies do when they raise). He also stressed, though, that the round isnt just meant for that. The round is not just to accelerate, but also to allow us to think bigger and take larger risks, Wanstrath said.Chris WanstrathThismeans GitHub acquisitions are likely on the horizon, but he also noted that the company wants to push its international strategy forward. It recently opened an office in Japan (and hosted its first meetup there) and other locations will likely follow.For us, GitHub is really about the developers  essentially its about people, Wanstrath said. What weve been trying to do is get more people on the ground to support these communities.Currently about 70 percent of GitHubs users are already outside of the U.S., so it only makes sense for the company to go where its users are.GitHubsenterprise service, too, has seen quite a bit of growthsince it launched in 2011, which is partly driven by the fact that many largebusinesses are currentlytrying to revamp their old software development practices around tools like Git. The company doesnt disclose numbers for its enterprise side, but Wanstrath told me that its doing super well and has seen some blockbuster quarters lately.There can be no doubt that Githas become something of a de facto version control system for many startups and GitHub currently leads the charge among companies that essentially offer Git as a service.Atlassian, Microsoft, GitLab and others offer similar services, both cloud-hosted and on premise, but GitHub has clearly attractedmost of the mindshare in recentyears.GitHubsays it currently has about 10 million users who are in collaboration on over 25 million projects (thats up from 10 million in January 2014). Given that the company offers free accounts, its not clear how many of these users are actually paying for the service, though (pricing starts at $5/month).
