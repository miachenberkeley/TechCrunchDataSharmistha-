GitHub Enterprise, the companys on-premises solution for managing code, is getting a major update today. Itcomes at a time when there seems to be some upheaval in the company around the importance management has been putting on this product.The marquee feature of GitHub Enterprise 2.5is support for clustering.With this, businesses can now set up a cluster of GitHub Enterprise servers that act as a single installation, enabling it to support significantly larger teams.With GitHub Enterprise 2.5 more users can be enabled on one system as teams grow, Kakul Srivastava, GitHubs VP of Product, tells me. We have customers with tens of thousands of developers who need to be able to work together, and this is really important functionality to enable them to do this in a scalable way.She also noted that clustering doesnt currently come at an additional cost to GitHubs enterprise users.This new version also includes interface improvements with updated designs for everything from log-in screens to thelook and feel of the GitHub repositories. This brings GitHubs enterprise product in line with its hosted version.Also new in this version is improved Subversion support  for those who arent using git as their version control system  as well as an API for managing protected branches (that is, branches developers can neither delete nor force-push their code to). This new API is currently in preview.In a written statement, Srivastava said that she believes GitHub is building a new kind of enterprise company; for us and our customers, its not about open source or enterprise, but rather, open source and enterprise. She added that GitHubs focus on the developer gets to the heart of serving them wherever they code  personal projects, open source communities, and even the very largest enterprises in industries such as banking, retail, and manufacturing.None of this, of course, addresses the concerns around the companys changing culture, but there can be little doubt that GitHubs future is directly tied to enterprise customers adopting its services to manage their code.
