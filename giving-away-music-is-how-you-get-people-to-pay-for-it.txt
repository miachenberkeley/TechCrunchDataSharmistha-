Giving away music is how you get people to pay for it. That might seem crazy, but its true, though Jay-Z doesnt want to listen. He just launched a music streaming service called Tidal withBeyonc,Daft Punk, Kanye, Arcade Fire, and Rihanna as co-owners contributing exclusive content. The goal is to get artists properly paid.The problem is Tidalsubscriptions costs $20 for high-definition streaming and $10 for regular quality, with no free ad-supported option. Most people wont pay.Focusing on exclusives is a cool concept that might appeal to crazy fans, but its probably not enough to make Tidal a big success.Watch the video above to hear why.Its a lot easier than reading a massive article about it.
