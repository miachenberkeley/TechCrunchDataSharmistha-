It offers mentorship for women, a content channel to highlight company thought leaders,and company-specific data analytics around diversity.Down the road,Glassbreakers will offer its solution to all employee resource groups, like ones for LGBTQI people, and people from diverse racial and ethnic groups.That being said, Glassbreakers is already built with intersectionality in mind, with ways for trans women of color, for example, to connect with each other.
