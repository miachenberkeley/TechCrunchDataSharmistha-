Other participants include current investors Battery Ventures and Sutter Hill Ventures. This new round brings Glassdoors total funding to just over $160 million.While Glassdoor may be best known for its rankings, the company also runsone of the largest job search and recruiting platforms with 27 million members.

The company recently launched its first non-English site and apps in France.With a $90 billion global recruiting and employment market, theres enormous opportunity for growth,said Laela Sturdy, a partner at Google Capital, in a canned statement today.Glassdoors job database, advanced search tools and growing global audience are attracting both job seekers and employer advertisers.The company tells me it doesnt have any specific plans for the new funding. Instead, the capital is mostly meant to provide Glassdoor with the flexibility to continue to grow and expand internationally. Its worth noting that Glassdoor has been investing heavily in its meta-search engine for jobs and other employer-focused products.Chances are, then, that at least some of its new funding will also go toward expanding that site of its business, too. In addition, a Glassdoor spokesperson told methat the company also continues to hire, with plans to add over 100 people to its roster this year alone.
