It may be common in the U.S., but here in Asia we dont often write about twenty-somethings pausingtheir education for a startup. So its notable thatGlints, a Singapore-based startup thathelps graduates enter the workforce, closeda SG$475,000 (US$380,000) seed round today.The companys foundersmight just be the youngest venture-backed team in Southeast Asia  and they already graduatedSingapore-based accelerator JFDI Asia.Glintsfounding trio  Oswald Yeo (CEO), Seah Ying Cong (CTO),Looi Qin En (CTO) are aged 22, 21 and 21respectively.Refreshingly, despite their youth, the team looks to have plenty of savy.Yeo told TechCrunch in an interview thatthis seed round was over-subscribed, butthe teamchose to pass on US$250,000 of additional money from other investorsin favor of working with thosethey know well.Wedidnt want to raise more than we needed, plus we wanted investors who we are comfortable with and who can provide more than just money, he explained.The round, as it is, was led by East Ventures, withparticipation from 500 Startups, SPH Media Fund, Singapore Infocomm Investments (IIPL), 8 Capita and Pix Vine Capital. It also included private backers, such asangel investors John Tan and Darius Cheung who had mentored the team since its time with JFDI Asia.Rather than taking on LinkedIn, a tallchallenge that many job-focused startups seem to try to do, Glintsaims to complement the professional networking site. It focuses on catering to graduates who want to enter the workforce with the right job or internship  given that the founding team deferred places at U.S.graduate schools to pursue the startup, it is certainly a problem they have personal experience of.Theres a huge gap between what is taught in schools and what is needed in the marketplace, Yeo said.Glints operates just like most job-seeking sites with a portal of open opportunities, but it tries to offer a more rounded guide for graduates, including training and development opportunities. One part of that is challenges that a range of companies setto give Glint users a small sliceof working life in certain industries.Rocket Internet-backed Easy Taxi challenges them to develop a sales pitch for hiringtaxi drivers to its platform, for example, while media giant SPH tests reporting chopswith a breaking news assignment.These tasks, Yeo said, not only help candidates get a slice of experience, but they help them stand out from the crowd since each successful task is rewarded with a badge displayed on their Glints profile. There is also a personality test because prospective employersare not just looking for skills, they seek aptitude and culture fits, Yeo said.Glints currently operates using a talent scout model which lets employers listvacancies forfree, then pay only when they interview a candidate.The service is focused on Singapore, where itcounts over 7,000 registered students and some 600 companies. But, with just 100,000 college students in the country, it is preparing to lookoverseas at some point this year.Yeo saidthe priority is to establish its business in its home market, after which the team is weighing upa regional expansion starting with Indonesia, or a more audacious branch outinto the U.S.. With expansion in mind, Glints is likely to seek another round of funding later this year, Yeo revealed.Yeo indefinitely deferred a place at theUniversity of California his co-founders did the same at Wharton and Stanford  a move that he admitted is taking his family some time to come to terms with.There was alot of resistance fromfriends and family in Singapore, but my friends in the U.S. werevery supportive, he said. Thats not uncommon in Asia, and Yeo pointed out that he could always return to his studies  plus, presumably the SG$500,000 raised by investors willhelp validate thatdecision with his family.Glints will be one to watch in Asia, even if it is just for the fact that the founding team is so young. Society in many parts of this regionis still traditionally risk-averse and preferential to jobs at big companies  there are fewcases of early twenty-somethings gaining backing fromSoutheast Asias venture capital firmsand putting a startup ahead of their education.
