The worlds major cosmetics companieslike LOreal and Shisheido are at least a century old.But a New York-based startup from a former fashion assistant at Vogue and W is making waves.Emily Weiss is the founder and CEO of Glossier, a skincare and cosmetics line that raised $8.4 million from Thrive Capital and other investors.Itstarted with a beauty blog she founded calledInto The Gloss. She interviewedmodels, makeup artists, and other role models about what products they used. The branddeveloped a cult following with more than 200,000 followers on Instagram, and 60,000 fans on Facebook.So naturally, the next logical step for the company wastolaunchitsown skincare line.They did that last year with the Phase 1 set  a line of four products from a moisturizer to a balm and a spray that came in at around an $80 price-point. They launched the new brand, Glossier, purelyonline through their fan base and the traction was enough to attract the interest of Thrive, which has backed among others Warby Parker and Harrys.The thesis is similar to whats powered Warby Parkers success.
