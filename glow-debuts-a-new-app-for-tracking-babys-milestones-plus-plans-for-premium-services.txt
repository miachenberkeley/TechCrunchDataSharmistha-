Glow, the company behind a suite of apps for tracking female and male fertility, pregnancy, menstruation, and sexual health, is again expanding its lineup with the launch of an application for new parents: Glow Baby.The app allows its usersto track babyskey developmental milestones, including things like when the baby first lifts its head, grabs with both hands, smiles, makes eye contact, sits up, and much more.Of course, babies tend to hit these milestones at their own pace  some earlier than others. But having a general sense of whether or not the child is progressing can help alert parents to problems. For example, if a baby isnt responding to his or her own name at some point, it could indicate they have trouble hearing. If baby is missing milestones by a wide margin, parents will likely want to bring up the subject with their childs doctor.The problem for parents is that, especially in that first year, there are a lot of milestones to keep track of  it can be overwhelming.The Glow Baby app can help with that, as it lists 101 specific developmental stages based on CDC data and medical advisors input.One notable name contributing his insight to the new app is the notable author of Baby 411 and top pediatrician, Dr. Brown. She created exclusive content for Glow Baby and is on the board of medical advisors, along with Dr. John Palma, a pediatrician at Stanford.While the focus is on milestone tracking, theapp isnt just a digital reference book  parents can also record the events with a date and a photo, similar to a baby journal. These photos can be later used to create albums or shared with friends and family.The app additionally allows parents to record illnesses and babys growth, including weight, length, head size and body mass index, as well as feeding schedules, diaper changes, and sleep.And if you just need support, Glow Babys built-in community lets you connect with other parents right in the app.Another big plus is that both parents  not just mom  can use the app through a feature that lets another person assist with milestone tracking.
