Glu Mobile, the mobile gaming company behind recent app store hits like the once-viral Kim Kardashian Hollywood, and who recently took a stake in top trivia game QuizUp, is hoping it has another potential breakout title on its hands thanks to a newly announced deal with pop star, Taylor Swift. According to news unveiled this week, Taylor and Glu will work together over the course of a multi-year partnership to deliver what the company describes as a new and highly differentiated gaming experience.What that gaming experience will include, Glu isnt yet saying, noting that specific game details wont be revealed until later this year.The game itself is expected to launch in late 2016, the company said.Glu also noted that this would be the Grammy award-winning artists first foray into mobile gaming.But its not Swifts first time developing a mobile property. The star previously won an Emmy for best Original Interactive Program for her AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience. That app, available for both iOS and Android, let viewers go inside Swifts Blank Space music video and explore the storylinein a 360-degree format.While not a game, that app could help predict how successful the forthcoming Swift property may become, and how well the star is able to convert her 227 million+ social followers into app downloads.Based on figures provided by App Annie, the Taylor Swift Experience app debuted as a top 10 app in the Music section on the iTunes App Store, and briefly flirted with a top 100 Overall ranking, but thereafter, quickly dropped. The app fell into the 100s, then 200s, then further, in the Music category and was last spotted at #399 in Music apps section on iTunes.The Android version followed a similar trajectory in Google Plays Music & Audio section.Swift also has her officialapp on iOS and Android, published by Mroadie, which has been around for years. But it barely ranks these days, having dropped to #540 in Music on iOS, and is currently unranked on Android.That doesnt mean that Swifts new game from Glu wont do well  after all, the official app is more like a mobile version of a website, while the music video is something that youll get enough of after a couple of viewings max. A mobile game, meanwhile, can be more engaging and played for longer periods of time.A mobile game, meanwhile, can be more engaging and played for longer periods of time.Plus, Glu has proven it can build out a game that has viral effects, as it did with the Kardashian title. Even if the games #1 App Store ranking doesnt last forever, it can pull into big dollars while its hot.Case in point: some estimated that Kims game would gross $200 million in annual revenue.It fell far short of that as its ranking slid, but still brought in$13.6 million or 24% of Glus revenue in Q4 2015.For Glu, the Swift partnership is a big win for the struggling gaming company which has been facing deteriorating net income, weak operating cash flow, and disappointing stock performance, as noted by The Street. The company said that for the fiscal first quarter 2016, its anticipating a loss between 5 and 6 cents per share on revenue between $46 million and $48 million.Despite this, the stock popped 23% on Thursday morning, and then was seen trading some 32% higher a few hours later.The boost was due to the news of the Swift deal, which investors clearly seemed enthused about despite the hit-or-miss world of mobile gaming.Perhaps they have short-term memories?Sure, Swift is a big catch but so was Katy Perry. And Glus recent bet to repeat its Kardashian success with Perry, whose game followed a similar formula to the earlier celeb title, pretty muchbombed. Hopefully for Glu Mobile, Swifts game will fare better.
