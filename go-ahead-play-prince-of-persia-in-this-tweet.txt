If you want to relive your classic MS-DOS gaming experiences, you need venture no further than Twitter. The Internet Archives website-embeddable games also now work directly in tweets, when youre viewing them on the web, or in native embeds like the one below.

Think about it: These games used to sometimes span multiple floppy discs, and now theyre just living inside tweets almost as an afterthought.Hope you were prepared to fall down a nostalgia hole today.Via TNW.
