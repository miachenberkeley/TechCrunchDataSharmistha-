The company reported revenues of $150.8 million in this division which is up 14.7 percent year-over-year.Interestingly, Irving noted that almost 50 percent of small businesses still have no online presence, which should help the companys growth in this segment going forward.Another divisionof the company Irving specifically mentioned was Business Applications, which reported revenues of $45.3 million, up almost 50 percent year-over-year. Irving said custom email domains were a big driver of revenue in this division, as more and more small businesses are realizing the importance of ditching generic domains (like @gmail and @yahoo), in favor of a custom one just for their business.International revenue, a growing segment of the business, totaled $105.3million, up 17.4 percent year-over-year.Irving saidthat the company was happy with last quarters international growth despite a strong dollar, and noted that GoDaddy is preparing to enter the Asian market in the first quarter of 2016.While still a growing company, GoDaddy has a large amount of debt on hand. Specifically, they ended the quarter with long-term debt of $1.048 billion, which is slightly down from the $1.05 billion in debt reported last quarter. However, this debt load is only about 2.5 times EBIDA, a ratio that Irving said thecompany feels comfortablewith.GoDaddys balance sheet at the end of the third quarter showed total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $333.1 million, up from the $294.8 million recorded at the end of last quarter.Finally, thecompany reported that the GoDaddy platform had 13.6 millioncustomers at the end of the third quarter, which is up 8.8percent year-over-year.Looking forward, the company expects Q4 revenue between $421-$424 million, and full-year revenue between $1.603 billion and $1.606 billion.
