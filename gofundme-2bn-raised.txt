GoFundMeseems to be everywhere these days; my social media feeds are never too many posts away from a campaign from the company raising funding for a cause or a goal.The companysappealis easy to understand: it is enablingtiny acts of philanthropy between friends, family, and communities. This week, the platform celebrates its community crossing the 25m donors milestone.Yes that Taylor Swift.GoFundMes success is perhaps not that surprising; it was the platform Taylor Swift used to make a $50,000 donation to a girl who had to miss her concert due to cancer treatment (well, after they changed their maximum donation limit), it is being used by WWE stars to raise money and has been in the news frequently  for good and for bad.The platform, most recently valued at $600m or so, is aiming to bring crowdfunding down to a micro scale, making it easy to raise money from small groups of people, for specific goals.Given that the GoFundMecollects 5% of all donations as its fee, its easy to see why there might be a bit of a party going on in its offices at the moment. Ill save you having to do the math: 5% of two billion is $100m, and while the company does re-donate a chunk of the money to causes onits own platform, its safe to say theres a lot of money in the charity business.As a platform, the GoFundMe side is exceptionally broad in its scope, and the site is full of absolutely gorgeous stories thatll restore your faith in humanity.Take Haileys Harvest, for example, a campaign where over a thousandpeople donated to help a 9-year-old girl help spendher free time building tiny portable houses, which she and her mother deliver to members of their local homeless community.Hailey received broad media attention and a lot of support from around the world to help her build little houses for the homeless in her city.James Robertson on his way to workOr how about one the sites most popular campaigns, raising a ludicrous amount of money to help James Robertson buy a car, after hed spent ten years walking 21 miles per day to get to work, without missing  or even being late  a single day. The story went viraland the part of the internet who loves a good story leapt at the opportunity to help out.For all the good the site does, there is an uncomfortable undercurrent, too. It probably isnt the sites fault  fraudsters have been adapting new technologies to part fools from their money for as long as there has been fools and money, butbut whenbrowsing through campaigns for an hour or so, I did find a significant number of campaigns that just didnt sit quite right.The variety of campaigns available on the platform is staggering.Some of the problematic campaignsmerely tasteless, along the lines of Im bored, buy me a Playstation, but I imagine public ridicule among their peers will eventually stamp that sort of thing out. Other campaigns are more worrying. In one campaign, a single father raising money to help care for a disabled child is besieged in the campaigns comments by anti-vaxxers. In other cases, reading the campaigns makes it obvious that its worth doing an extra round of due diligence before reaching for your wallet; there have been quite a few cases of fraud, especiallyin the aftermath of natural disasters.Its obvious that theres a place in the crowdfunding spacefor sites like GoFundMe; itworks extremely well when it is used to raise funding from friends and family, and the peer pressure effect combined with the feeling of helping out afriend in a time of need is a potent cocktail thateffects a real differencein peoples lives at a grass-roots level. Heres to the next 25m donors!
