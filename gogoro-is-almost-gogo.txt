Gogoro, the Taiwan-based startup that raised $150 million in stealth mode before unveiling its flagship electric scooter, has finally revealed how much the vehicles will cost.In a press conference today, co-founder Horace Luke (HTCs former chief innovation officer), said that a Smartscooter will cost NTD$128,000 (about $4,140) to pre-order in Taiwan, where Gogoro is currently running a pilot program with support from Taipei City and neighboring New Taipei City.As Luke pointed out, this is more than a 125cc gas scooter that costs NTD $81,000, or $2,620 (a relatively high-end price bracket). When government subsidies for electric vehicles and the cost-savings of using Gogoros batteries instead of gas are considered, however, the company claims that overall cost of owning a Smartscooter will be less than its gas counterpart after two years of use.#Gogoro

Gogoro differentiates with an extremely easy to use battery-swapping system and an app that lets Smartscooter owners monitor the performance of their vehicles, but it remains to be seen if customers are willing to pay a higher upfront cost or if the company will be able to build the necessary charging infrastructure in other cities.
