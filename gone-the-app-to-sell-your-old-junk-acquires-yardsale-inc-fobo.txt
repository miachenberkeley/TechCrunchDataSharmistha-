Gone, the app that helps you sell your old crap, has announced the acquisition of FOBO and former marketplace company Yardsale Inc. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.Gone launched back in June of 2014 to change the way you sell your old junk. With Gone, you simply take a picture of the item, put in some quick info about it, and Gone handles the rest.Through algorithms, the service finds the best price to sell your item, lists it on a few different sales sites, handles comms for the sale, and even sends you a check.Within Austin, TX and San Francisco, Gone will actually have a team member come and pack up your item properly and take it away for you.Outside of those markets, Gone sends you all the packing materials you need, including shipping labels, and instructions on how to schedule a UPS pick-up.FOBO/Yardsale represents Gones first acquisition.Yardsale Inc. was a YC-backed company, founded by Ed McManus and Ryan Mickle, that helped users sell stuff to their neighbors. Yardsale reached 130,000 users before the duo shut it down to focus on FOBO, which was an auction-based website that lets users sell their stuff via a mobile app.According to Gone, FOBO had reached a $1 million yearly revenue run rate in just two months before the acquisition.Both McManus and Mickle, Yardsale and FOBO founders, will join the Gone advisory board.
