Just in time for the hustle-and-bustle of Memorial Day Weekend, Google has added traffic alerts to Google Maps.Google has shown traffic conditions for a while now, but this update actually brings with it explanations as to why various routes will be faster, alerts for a blockage or traffic jam up ahead, and of course, alternate routes to each destination.If/When a traffic jam pops up while youre en route, Google Maps will also tell you about how long it expects you to be waiting if you stay on the same path, or give you other options.Simple, yet useful.The company also pulled data from Google Maps searches in the past to see what people would be getting up to this weekend. Top searches from last year include the beach, the cemetery, the gas station, restaurants, furniture stores, and ice cream shops.Google also used last years data to determine the most popular getaway spots for big hubs like San Francisco and New York, which you can check out here.Enjoy yourself (and be safe out there) this weekend![via SlashGear]
