The battle between Googles artificial intelligence and Go world championLee Sedolconcluded today after the former (AlphaGo) triumphed to win the five-game series 4-1.AlphaGo, created by London-based DeepMind  which wasacquired by Google for around $500 million in 2014  found itselfin a little trouble during todays final match in Seoul, but it managed to turn it around and take victory,DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said onTwitter.#AlphaGo made a bad mistake early in the game (it didnt know a known tesuji) but now it is trying hard to claw it back nail-biting.

Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) March 15, 2016That AlphaGo was able to recover from an error against one of the best players on the planet is a real testament to the itsability, and the development of AI to date. More widely, its seriesvictory marks a historic landmark for the development of artificial intelligence. Go is an east Asian game that is famous for its deep complexity, boundless possibility of movesandstrategic thinking. For AI researchers like Hassabis, it is the ultimate test of their creations.Pundits were divided on AlphaGos potential to win in the lead in to the matches. The AI beatthe European Go champion last year, but Lee  a legend in the game  was seen as a far stiffer challenge.Unlike previously AI victories  such asDeep Blues defeatofchess grandmasterGarry Kasparov in 1997, or IBM Watsons Jeopardy! triumph in 2011  DeepMind programmed AlphaGo to be capable of teaching itself, not just carrying out a set of fixed moves or activities. Indeed, the fact that Lee chalked up one match victoryand pushed the machine hardshows that it is not impenetrable and is also capable of making mistakes or being outwitted. In other words, theres still scope for further progress and development despite this incredible achievement.Lee Sedol wins game 4!!! Congratulations! He was too good for us today and pressured #AlphaGo into a mistake that it couldnt recover from Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) March 13, 2016The winner here, no matter what happens, is humanity, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidtsaidprior to the first match, and that certainly seems to ring true now the challenge  and $1 million purse riding on it  has been decided.You can look through the games viathe DeepMind YouTube channel.
