At Googles I/O conference today, Googles Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) research unitoffered an update on its interactive textiles project unveiled last year, Project Jacquard. ATAPsIvan Poupyrev announced that the company was collaborating with iconic clothing company, Levis, to launcha connected smart jacket aimed at urban cyclists that will allow wearers to do things like control their music, answer phone calls, access navigation and more, all by tapping and swiping on the jackets sleeve.Googles partnership with Levis was first announcedlast year, but the two companies hadnt yet disclosed how the clothing maker would implement Project Jacquards technology.In case you missed it previously, thisproject involves weaving multi-touch sensors into clothes in order to make what youre wearing the newwellwearable computing device.The idea with this new Levis Commuter jacket, explained the company, isto make something thats both fashionable to wear while also representing a practical implementation of the technology.Today, cyclists often have to fuss with their phone while commuting on busy streets, which is dangerous.With Levis Commuter jacket, theyll instead be able to just touch their jackets cuff, using gestures to control various functions they would otherwise need to pull out their phone to do.The jacket will be a part of Levis Commuter collection of clothing, which is largely aimed at urban dwellers who ride bikes to navigate their city.A Jacquard tag is embedded in the jackets sleeve, making this functionality possible, and it can be pulled out and charged via USB. This tag connects with the LED, haptics, battery and the woven sensor in the garment. The connection points for the tech cleverly takes advantageof the jackets button-hole to look less obtrusive.In addition, the platform includes a mobile application that connects your smart clothes to the cloud. Here is where consumers will control the apps that work with the connected garment.Plus, the company stressed, you can use the Levis jacketlike any other article of clothing  wad it up, throw it in the wash, etc.Theres a unique challenge in creating a smart clothes platform  fashion and technology have to work as one but theres inherent tension between the two, saidPoupyrev. Technology is fragile, garments are not.In addition to controllingnative phone functions like calls, as well as Google Maps and Google Play Music, Google says the jackets will interoperate with third-party services. That means youll be able to use the touches to control your Spotify music, for example, or a connected fitness app, like Strava. APIs will also be made available.During a demo on stage at the event, the companies showed offhow the jacket worked.For instance, running fingers up and down the cuff controlled the music volume. Another feature, Compass, was accessed with a swipe. After doing so, a voice assistant informed the wearer, Levis VP of InnovationPaulDillinger,of their next meeting time and how long it would take to arrive.While the demo went off well, you could see there was a slightstiffness on the cuff where the sensors were woven in, and a bit of a bulge. Its unclear how comfortable that will be  or how attractive.Google says it plans to work with other apparel makers in the future to expand Jacquards reach, including athletic clothing companies and those who design business wear. (Though not mentioned out loud, Cintas logo briefly appeared on one slide during the presentation during the partners discussion.)Perhaps of most interest is that this jacket isnt some far-off pipe dream, as it turns out  itwill launch into beta testing this fall,then become publicly available in spring 2017, says Google.Pricing info was not offered.
