Twitter is reported to have struck a significant partnership with Google on the eve of its latest financial results. Bloomberg reports that the two companies have agreed to a deal to put real-time tweets from Twitter back into Googles search results sometime in the first half of this year.Twitter declined to comment when contacted the company for confirmation.The partnership would give Google access to Twitters data fire hose again, something that search rivals Yahoo and (Microsoft) Bing already enjoy. Twitter and Google struck a similar agreement back in 2009, but it was not renewed in 2011. That left Google needing to crawl the Twitter services to index tweet  a process that takes time. Terms of this apparent new deal willmake tweets visible inside Googles search results immediately after they are tweeted out.This coming together would be significant for a couple of reasons.Bloombergs sources claim there is no advertising revenue deal here, but Google will reportedly pay data-licensing revenue. Thats a revenue line item that Twitter grew from $16 million to $41 million in the past year, and  with Google on board  theres more to come.Secondly, with Twitter expandingthe scope of its advertisingthis week so that PromotedTweetsappear on third party apps and sites  starting withFlipboard and Yahoo Japan  the company is keen to pull in and monetize visitors to its service who are not registered Twitter users. Appearing more prominently in Googles search results page could significantly boost this business.The deal may be positive for Twitter, but itcould have implications for Googles own social network.One of the positive features about Google+, the companys own social service, was that updatesprominently in search results  potentially driving new traffic websites and bringing more business for companies. The prospect ofreal-time Twitter returning is yet another signal that Google is stepping off the gas for Google+  Vic Gundotra, who lead the service, left Google last April, asthe company started viewing Google+ as a platform rather than a product.
