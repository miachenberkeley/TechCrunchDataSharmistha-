Update, 27/02: Google has decided to reverse the proposed ban. Instead it will step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn. (H/t Engadget)Google is banning adult content from websites hostedonBloggerfrom next month, after the company updatedregulations governing the use of mediaon itsblogging service.Acompany support page for Blogger explains that starting March 23, 2015, you wont be able to publicly share images and video that are sexually explicit or show graphic nudity on Blogger.Global News reports that emails were sent to Blogger users informing them ofthe policy change.Google isnt actually deleting any salacious websites, however.Blogs that fall foul of thenew policy will be made private after March 23, Google said, unless they remove the content in question. That meanstheywillbeinvisible to anyone but the blog owner and any associated admins. That said,newblogs created from March 23 thatinclude sexually explicit material may be straight up deleted, the company explained.There is a small caveat:Well still allow nudity if the content offers a substantial public benefit, for example in artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific contexts, Google said.It appears that the internet giant will be in charge of interpreting exceptions that fall under that rule, so dont expect many allowances to be made.The current policy allows sexual material (so long as it is legal) on a blog, which is then marked with an adult warning for any visitors.Googledidnt saywhy it has made the change, and a company rep declined to provide further details to TechCrunch when we reached out to seekclarification.The companys last significant policy change for Blogger came in 2013, when itcracked down on Blogger-hosted sites that monetized adult content. Now it is removing adult content from the network altogether.
