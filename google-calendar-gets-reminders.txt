Gmail has had a to-do feature for the longest time, but it was pretty useless, as it was a simple standalone, one-off feature that probably graduated from Labs at one point. It was never integrated. Luckily the team is fixing that today.Google is rolling out the ability to add reminders in Google Calendar for iOS and Android (web soon).Why this took so long is a pretty good question, but hey its better late than never. Heres what the team had to say about the update:You might already create calendar entries to remind you to call the doctor or pick up groceries on the way home. But while those entries come and go, Reminders stick with you over time so you can track them until they are actually done. If a Reminder isnt completed, it will appear at the top of your Calendar the next day. And the next. When you do finally call the doctor or pick up those necessities, just swipe the Reminder away  and youre onto the next to-do.The feature surfaces all of the information you need to get the task done, like an address or phone number. You can also create a Reminders from Inbox, Keep and Google Now. So basically, you can say Remind me to take out the trash today at 1pm and itll slap up on your calendar just like that. Very Siri-like.
