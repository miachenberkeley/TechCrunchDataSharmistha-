Bavor didnt offer any updated metrics on the sheer amount of actual headsets out there today, other than reiteratingthere were millions and millions of themout in the wild.Other mobile VR makers have a long way to go to catch up with Googles effortless VR platform. Samsung announced last week that the company had over 1 million users on their Gear VR platform last month, but also specified that there were only 250 apps on the Oculus store for the headset.Googleannounced a host of things related to its virtual reality aspirations today, including a low-latency Daydream VR mode in Android N and a new reference design for future Google Cardboard hardware.
