Mobile is the big tech focus for India  with initiatives like Facebooks Internet.org and Googles Android One, to name but two  but that isnt stopping Google from introducing new budget Chromebook laptops inthe South Asian country.The Mountain View-based firm announced two sub-$250 Chromebooks, laptops powered by its web-based Chrome OS platform, from domestic manufacturers Nexian and Xolo.The Nexian Chromebook retails for 13,499 INR ($212) from Amazon  its currently on sale for 12,999 INR  while Xolos device is available from Snapdeal for 13,999 INR, around $220. Chromebooks traditionally pack a punch for their price, particularly for educational purposes, buttend to rely on having an internet connection for most tasks and features.Thats not quite all Google said also that machines from ASUS, Samsung and other Indian companies will hit the market soon to provide even greater choice.The U.S. company first introduced Chromebooks to India in late 2013. The budget machineshave been popular among schools and other educational institutions in the West, and now Google has announced that they are available for schools in India too. Thats important because, while mobile is no doubt the future of content consumption, laptop and desktop machines appear  for now  to be pivotal forcontent creation. (Even a $200 Chromebook can be a development machine, thanks to software like Nitrous.IO.)India Today got itshands on the two new productsand found that there was little to choose from, performance-wise, from them. Both run on a RockChip SoC, which is not exactly aknown quantity, although the Xolo appeared to have superior design and ergonomics  from theinitial hands-on, at least.The challenge for the Google-powered machines is to beat out Microsoft at the sub-$300 pricepoint. Windows is the most prevalent platform for desktop machines across Asia, and, although Chrome does support a growing number of offline features, Windows-powered machines appear to offermore advanced features for a little extra spend. Choice though, is never a bad thing, and the Chromebook has Googles brand to help appealto consumers.
