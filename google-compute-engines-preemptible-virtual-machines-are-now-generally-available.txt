Googlespreemptiblevirtual machine instancesfor Compute Engine are now generally available.The company launched these preemptible virtual machines (VMs)about four months ago. What makes this type of VMspecial is that Google canshut it down at any time but in return sells it at a significant discount of up to 70 percent.The concept behind preemptible instances is somewhat similar to that of Amazon Web Services spot instances in that Google is probably also using this service as a way tosell unused machines at a discount when they are running idle. Google notes that it may not have any of these instances available during peak usage (but hints that plenty of machines are typically available during nights and weekends). While Amazon uses a bidding process, though, Google sells these instances for a set price.Because Google may terminate these machines at any time, you probably dont want to run anyworkloadson them that arent fault-tolerant. Forthe kind of distributed compute and batch workloads that can failover when one machine goes down, though, preemptible machines can offer significant cost savings.The Broad Institute used Cycle Computings service and preemptible VMs for its genomics research, for example. Preemptible VMs are a great newoffering for big compute, analytics, and batch workloads, and were happy to support them as anoption for our customers. The Broad Institutes story showcases a production workload running in 6hours instead of 6 weeks, thanks to Preemptible VMs, said Jason Stowe, CEO of Cycle Computingin todays announcement.Googles recently acquired Zync visual effects and animation rendering solutionalso uses preemptible VMsas an option for users who want to reduce their rendering cost.
