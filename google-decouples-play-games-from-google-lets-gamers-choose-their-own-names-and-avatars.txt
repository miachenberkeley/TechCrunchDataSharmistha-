Until today, you needed a Google+ account to use Google Play Games, Googles online gaming servicefor bringing online multiplayer gaming, video recordings and social features like profiles and leaderboards to Android games.Today, Google is launching an update to Play Games, however, that removes this requirement. All you need to sign up now is a regular Google account and instead of having to use your real name (or at least the one associated with your Google+ profile), you can now choose any random Gamer ID and avatar to representyou.Google tells me these changes will roll out globally over the course of the next week, so if you dont see it right away, just give it a few more days.Google is also now making it easier to sign into Play Games. Instead of having to sign in for every game separately, all you have to do now is sign in once for your account. After that, youll be automatically signed in when youinstall a new app and start a new game.As Google product manager Benjamin Frenkel (who now goes by the Gamer ID of Caldorfon Google Play Games) told me, Google made these changes to improve the social experience and to remove as much friction as possible  though this is also obviously part of Googles overall process of consciously uncoupling its services from Google+.As Frenkel told me, your Gamer ID is linked to your email address and you will be able to search for your friends by their email addresses (and, of course, their Gamer IDs). As Google notes, though, you can always choose whether to make your Play Games activity and profile public or private and whetherothers canfind you by your real name and email address.To personalize your account, you can now also choose from over 40 avatars to represent you in Play Games. For now, you cant customize these avatars, but Frenkel left the door open for more customization options to arrive in the future.Google saysmost developers wont have to make any changes to their games, unless they added some additional scopes to the sign-in process. All those developers would have to do is to remove these extra calls, though, and the process should just work for their apps, too.
