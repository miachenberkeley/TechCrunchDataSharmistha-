Much was written of an historic moment for artificial intelligence last week when a Google-developed AI beat one of the planets most sophisticated players of Go, an East Asia strategy game renowned for its deepthinking and strategy.Go is viewedas one of the ultimate tests for an AI given the sheer possibilities on hand. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions [in the game] thats more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess, Google said earlier this year.If youmissed the series  which AlphaGo, the AI, won 4-1  or were unsure of exactly why itwasso significant, Googlesummed the general importance up in a post this week.Far from just being a game,Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of DeepMind  the Google-owned company behind AlphaGo  said the AIs development is proof that it can be used to solve problems in ways that humans may be not be accustomed or able to do:Weve learned two important things from this experience. First, this test bodes well for AIs potential in solving other problems. AlphaGo has the ability to look globally across a boardand find solutions that humans either have been trained not to play or would not consider. This has huge potential for using AlphaGo-like technology to find solutions that humans dont necessarily see in other areas.Hassabis also pointed that the match-up, which was billed as man versus machine, is actually a testof man versus man because AlphaGo itself is a creation:AlphaGo is really a human achievement. [Go World Champion and AlphaGo opponent] Lee Sedol and the AlphaGo team both pushed each other toward new ideas, opportunities and solutions  and in the long run thats something we all stand to benefit from.The DeepMind CEO paid tribute to the brilliance of Lee, who himself said that his single match victory was an important landmark, and kept his feet on the ground about the future of artificial intelligence despite the progress made.Were still a long way from a machine that can learn to flexibly perform the full range of intellectual tasks a human can  the hallmark of true artificial general intelligence,Hassabis said.That sounds like its straight back to the grindfor DeepMind now that the celebrations are over. This past weeks activities have helped shine a light and raise awareness of whats possible, and no doubt theyll be heightened interest in DeepMinds future projects, regardless of whether they includegames of Go.
