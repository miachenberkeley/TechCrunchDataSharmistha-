Google is continuing to open its Android platform to mobile developers in China after it announced a localized version of its GoogleDevelopers YouTube channelfor the country.The U.S. firm took a major step last Novemberwhen it began allowing developers in China to make money viaAndroid apps  although only from users based outside of China  and this new channel will help by increasing access to information andresources.The channel is on YouTube  which willmean itgets disrupted by Chinas censorship system, unless viewersuse a (stable) VPN  and includes videos from the main developers channel with Chinese subtitles, as well as original content in Mandarin.ThatEnglish-language Developer Channel has more than 650,000 subscribers. Itsa useful resource for developers,covering a range of topics related to Android, Android Wear, web and other apps, general developments and information,and talking points fromevents like the Google Developer Conference.Google Play itself remains blocked in China, and numerous third-party app stores have risento take its place, including91Wireless, a service that search giant Baidu bought for $1.9 billionin 2013. But, we live in a global age, and even though the Play Store is not accessible in China, developers based in the country can use it to distributeand sell apps tothe hundreds of millions ofAndroid devicesin the rest of the world.Google is doubtless missing out on revenue by not having its app store in China, and areport from The Information(paywalled) last year claimed itsexecutives are in discussions with potential partners and the government with a view to launching Google Play services there. Theres been no official comment from Google or update on this  even if Google Play did make a controversial return to China, it remains to be seen how much of animpact such a late arrival would have.
