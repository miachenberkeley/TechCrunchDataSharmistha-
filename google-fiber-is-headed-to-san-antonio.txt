How speedy? In case you missed this ridiculous video out of Provo, Utah, have a watch:Politicians in cities are jockeying for cool new exciting initiatives like this to entice new businesses and residents, and San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor is no different: Im excited that this could mean amazing things for increasing access for affordable Internet services throughout our community.Google Fiber is coming to San Antonio! pic.twitter.com/W1D1RBEBP5 Mayor Ivy R Taylor (@IvyRTaylor) August 5, 2015The affordable part hasnt been a part of the story yet, which is the really interesting promise of Google Fiber. To date, only affluent neighborhoods have been outfitted and are calling for new customers. Hopefully that changes soon.And hey. What about us, Google? We get everything first :(
