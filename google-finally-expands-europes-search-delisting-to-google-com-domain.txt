Its taken well over a year for Google to shift its position but the search giantisfinally buckling to European data protection regulators demands to applygranted search delisting requests onthe Google.com domain, as well as European subdomains as it currently does.Search delisting refers to the so-called right to be forgotten ruling made by Europes top court back in May 2014which judged that search engines are data controllers and therefore must process individual requests from Europeans to delist outdated or irrelevant personal data, in line with regionaldata protection law.In June last year,French data protection watchdog CNIL ordered Google to widen its implementation of the right to be forgottenruling so that links would bedelisted from all Google domains, includinggoogle.com, not just from the .fr French subdomain.Google is still not publicly doing soyet, but TechCrunch understands itwill be amending its implementation of the ruling to include Google.com, with this change due to be appliedshortly  perhaps as early as the middle of this month. Earlier today the New York Timesreportedthe companywill be making the change by early next month.Google isnt making any public comment at this stage butTechCrunch understandsthe companyhasa technological twist up its sleeve in how it will implement delisting on Google.com  namely geoblocking. So only searchers located in the same geographical location as the successful delisting request will have the offendingsearch result removed from Google.com. Those searching Google.com from other locations (i.e. from outside Europe, or from another European country unrelated to the specific delisting request) may still see delisted search results.Its a location-based compromisethat has been suggested beforeto address the tricky problem of affordingindividual privacy without leaving trivial workarounds nor trampling too broadly on the wider publics ability to access information. And while Google still treats copyright removals (for instance) toa fullerglobal delisting, the company is evidently sweatingto avoidgranting such sweeping powers to European privacy requests. It has lobbied against the court ruling since day one, and fought to limit how it is implemented. And indeed continues to fight by coming up with this latest geoblocking optionas an alternative to implementing full global delisting.It remains to be seen whether thecompromise will please the DPAs, though. On that front Google istaking another gamble, so may yet be forced to offer fuller global delisting in time. (A spokesperson for the French data protection watchdog, the CNIL, told Reuters yesterday that it had been informed of Googles plans and was nowanalyzingthe move in light of theissue of territorial scope. A spokeswoman for the CNIL reiterated this position in an email toTechCrunch today, saying: We have been informed about what Google is willing to change and our services are going to analyze these elements.)But in the short term at least Googlewill be hoping that geoblocking placates the Europeanregulators  regulators that have been fired up by other recent ECJ privacy-related judgements, such as last years strikedown of the Safe Harbor transatlantic data transfer agreement.A newgeneral data protection directive was also agreed by European politicians at the back end of last year which will bringinstricter penalties for privacy infringements when it comes into force in 2018. Such wider moves in Europe to bolster regional data protection regulationmay have helped concentrate Googles mind on the search delisting front to come into fuller compliance.
