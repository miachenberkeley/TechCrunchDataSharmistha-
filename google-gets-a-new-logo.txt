Google is giving itself a makeover. The company today announced thatits making some changes to its iconic logo and overall branding. Its also making changes to the design of its mobilesearch results pages.The company says its making these changes because the way people interact with its products has changed. The idea is for the new logo andidentity family to reflect this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens.So what has changed? The old Google colors are still there, but the companyhas moved from a serif font to a sans-serif font for its full logo. For its icon, Google has done away with the small blue g icon and has replaced it will a four-color G.We think weve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future, the company writes in todays announcement.In a more in-depth post, Google explains the thinking behind the new logos design. The team says it wanted to distill the essence of our brand down to its core  four colors on a clean white background  and built it back up.In this process, the team decided to take the old logo and combine its approachable style with the mathematical purity of geometric forms with the childlike simplicity of schoolbook letter printing.Google says its also making some changes on its mobile search pages. For now, those changes look subtle, with a stronger focus on swiping through results horizontally (similar to what Google is already doing with Twitter results, for example).The Google mobile app is also getting a refresh in line with these changes today, as well as a few updates to how it presents Google Now cards (which now shift and change size throughout the day).It looks like the new brand identity is already making its wayto Googles campus, too:New Google logo: WIP pic.twitter.com/ZGc2AN0Yb2 Laura Melahn (@lauramelahn) September 1, 2015Given the fact that Google is now part of Alphabet, its probably not a major surprise that the company is using this time of change to refresh its brand, too.
