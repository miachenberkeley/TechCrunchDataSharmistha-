Googles Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette wasnt too optimistic about the future of Google Glass on todays Google earnings call for Q4 2014. The executive took some time to highlight the project as an example of when Google is willing to take a step back and rethink something that isnt working out, even when theyve made a considerable investment in the tech.When teams arent able to [leap] hurdles, but we think theres still a lot of promise, we might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass, Pichette said. [A]nd in those situations where projects dont have the impact we hope for, we do take the tough calls, we make the decision to cancel them, and youve seen us do this time and time again.Google discontinued the Glass Explorer program back on January 19, after announcing it would shut down and be reassigned to Tony Fadells consumer hardware department within the company. Google is still encouraging developers to develop for the platform, and a repositioning under Fadell also doesnt indicate a finality of its fate, but Pichettes comments today are the most concrete statement weve heard on the Glass programs outcome from a top executive, and they certainly dont suggest an imminent consumer launch.Glass might live on as something else, but Pichettes statements today suggest we might not recognize the form it takes when it does eventually re-emerge.
