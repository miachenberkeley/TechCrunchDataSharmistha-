Google is not an enterprise company and we are trying to become cognizant of what the enterprise needs,Craig McLuckie, Googles product manager in charge of its Kubernetes and Google Container Engine projects, acknowledged during a panel discussion at the OpenStack Foundations annualSilicon Valley event today.Its no secret that Google has been tryingto get more enterprises onto its cloud platform. Its not been easy, however. The company lacksthetraditional sales machinery of itscompetitors (and the legacy relationships that companies like Microsoft have built for decades).Instead, Google expects that becoming more open  and releasing more open-source software  will create a path for the company to make inroads into the enterprise. Google has recognized that open is a better way of building, McLuckie also noted. Weve come to admire the ability of the open-source community to drive innovation.He argued that building out in the open not only allows it to build a better product for its customers, but also to enable faster integration cycles. In addition, having an open-source project that involves other companies also allows it to absorb the DNA of these companies into the product.Kubernetes is probably the prime example for this. After being incubated by Google, the container management and scheduling tool is now quickly becoming a standard component of many container architectures. Google recently donated the code to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, too, so its now being developed by a group of companies that includes the likes of Red Hat, Docker, IBM, VMWare, Huawei, Docker and Twitter.Google wants businesses to be able to move their workloads between clouds (though mostly to its own cloud, of course) and containers and Kubernetes are a key piece of the technology that it believes will enable this once enough of itspartners adopt it.In an interview after his panel, McLuckie also said that Google plans to open source otherparts of its infrastructure stack, though he wouldnt quite say which ones.Its clear, though, that Google is very serious about going in this direction.McLuckieacknowledged that it took him a while to convince the companyssenior vice president of technical infrastructure and Google Fellow (and his boss)Urs Hlzle that open sourcing some of Googles secret sauce was something the company should consider, but it seems like there is pretty broad buy-in for this strategy across the company now.Its worth noting that others, including industry heavyweights likeMicrosoft, are also now releasing more of their codeinto the open-source ecosystem. And theres a reason for that.If you are not building open source, then you are at a competitive disadvantage to those who are, McLuckie said.
