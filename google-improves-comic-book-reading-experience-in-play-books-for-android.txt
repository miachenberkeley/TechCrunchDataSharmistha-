Google todaylaunched an upgrade to its Google Play Books store for Android that will make it easier to read comics on your phone and tablet. The company also today introducedpersonalized comic recommendations to make it easier tofind similar series, as well as a set of curated series pages for comics in the Play Store.All of these updates are now rolling out on Android for users in theUnited States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, India, Singapore, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa.As Googles lead product manager for Play Books Greg Hartrell told me earlier this week, this is thefirst update to Play Books that was specificallymeant to improve the comic-reading experience.This was largely born out of the fact that comic books are hugely popular as a category on Google Play, Hartrell told me, adding that comic book readers turn twice as many pages as others on Google Play Books. Given the nature of comic books, that may not necessarily come as a surprise, and Google hasnt released any other stats about the popularity of different book categories in its store. Hartrell did note, however, comics easily rank among the most popular categories in the store.Reading comics (or graphic novels, if thats more your thing) on small screens has never beenideal. The new reading experience on Android (with iOS support coming soon) will pop up when you are in landscape mode. In this mode, you can now easily scroll through a story with just vertical swipe.AsHartrell told me, the team developed this new reading mode by looking at how existing users were reading comics on Google Play (usinggood old-fashioned usability studies, as he put it).As for the new recommendations and curated series pages, Google says the aim here is to simply makebrowsing and finding interesting comics to read easier.Its worth noting that this new feature is currently only available for some of the more well-known publishers in Googles catalog. These include the likes ofDC Comics, Marvel, Image, IDW and Dark Horse. The new reading experience is available for books from all publishers.
