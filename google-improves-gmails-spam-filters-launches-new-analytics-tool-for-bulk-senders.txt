Google saysits Gmail spam filters are now smarter than ever. While the service always used machine learning to figure out what was (and wasnt) unwanted email, it now uses a more sophisticated neural networking approach to analyze incoming messages.The new filters are also better at figuring out your individual preferences, Google says.Whats one persons spam, after all, could be anothers daily influencer marketing newsletter. Until now, training the Gmail filter by marking messages as spam (or not spam) mostly trained the overall machine learning algorithm, it seems, but didnt have a lot of influence on your individual mailbox.The company says that it has also improved its overall phishing protection thanks to new machine learning signals.For legitimate bulk senders  those who need to send lots of receipts, confirmation emails, etc.  Googletoday launched its Gmail Postmaster Tools. This new service will allow these qualified high-volume senders to get a better idea of how Gmail treats their emails (its basically Google Webmaster Tools for bulk senders).If you are a spammer or phisher, chances are you canalso get some useful info from this tool, though you are probably not the target audience for it (and Im still going to reply to you about that inheritance thats waiting for me in Nigeria).Update: Google tells me the tool is only available to qualified senders who meet its reputation requirement, so spammers are out of luck.The tool will tell give users access to a number of dashboards, including ones that show how often users report the sendersemails as spam, for example. Postmaster Tools will also give senders more insight into their domains reputation (send a lot of spam and Gmail will downgrade you) and additional info about how Gmail treats their messages.
