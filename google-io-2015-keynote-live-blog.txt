We started with driving a few priuses around in parking lots. Our newer hybrid vehicles have now driven over 1M miles, with 0 accidents caused by a self driving carSundar has returned to the stageJUMP videos are coming to YouTube, and the first stereoscopic JUMP videos will be viewable on YouTube this summer.The Jump video assembler requires thousands of computers; theyll open it up to select creators in a few months.By analyzing in between viewpoints, they can stitch it together in a way that allows you to move your head a bit within the simulation and have the image re-align accordingly. Its not full environment movement, of course, but its much more than the static 360-degree video weve seen to date.Its not just a camera rig, though; theres an incredibly complex bit software running behind the rig to stitch the video together in stereoscopic 3d.GoPro will, however, be building and selling a JUMP ready camera rig.Its a concept similar to Cardboard; its seemingly not something theyre outright selling, but its a camera rig theyve designed and are sharing with everyone.Jump allows anyone to create immersive VR videoNow, how do these immersive experiences get built? We want to put professional tools in the hands of anyone. Today, we want to preview something we call Jump.Theyre playing a video now, showing kids in a classroom using cardboard to visit the great wall of china, museums, and moreHoly crap, thats some straight up magic-school-bus shitAll of the cardboard viewers/devices in the classroom are synchronized. If the teacher puts the class in an expedition at the bottom of the ocean, everyone is experiencing it at the same time, but is free to look around on their ownA box arrives to your classroom, with everything you need to experience it. Viewers, a teacher control tabletVR can take you places; today, were announcing EXPEDITIONSThats it for the Cardboard viewer, but were on to a related topic: Cardboard in the classroomThe cardboard SDK now works for Android and iOSThe new cardboard viewer takes just 3 steps to assembleThe new viewer has a button that works with any phoneFirst: A new cardboard viewer, built for screens up to 6There are 3 things we want to shareToday, Im really excited to give you a glimpse of whats new for cardboardToday, there are more than 1 million cardboard viewers out in the worldClay Bavor, VP of Product Manager of the Cardboard team has taken the stageWeve been thinking hard about VR, and how to get a more immersive experienceWeve been thinking a lot about how to bring the real world to the user in new ways. We started our efforts here with Google CardboardWeve been working with Udacity  and today were launching the Android Nanodegree. Its a 6 month, $200 course that [walks you through the entirety of developing for Android]Youve heard how developers can build amazing experiences on top of our platforms. Now we want to enable the next-gen of developers as well. Thats it for family stuff! Sundar is coming back to the stageYou can also find family-friendly apps based on popular characters  brands like Dora, Sponge Bob, Lego, and Star WarsYou can navigate into a family home page, and display apps built for specific age groupsToday, were launching a new family discovery experience.

Its called the Family StarNow lets talk about one group for which finding the right content is just so important: familiesNow, when someone searches for something broad  like shopping  we organize results into categories. Things like fashion, orcoupons.With more than a billion users, the Play store is incredibly diverse; it makes sense that the Play store you see is different than from what your friends seeIf youre an App Developer, Play is how you reach new users. The better we make the experience, the more users come back to install your gamesGoogle Play now has 1B active users, with 50B app installs in the past 12 months.Ellie Powers, Product Manager of Google Play has taken the stage to discuss new ways users can discover apps within the store.Developers can now have pages/profiles within the Google Play store.Its one, customized home for all of your appsDevelopers can now see complex conversion statistics; where buyers are coming from (Google Play?

Now, for the first time: turn by turn voice directions, offlineLets pretend were in Mexico City. Weve saved this map previously.. and just to prove were really talking offline, lets go ahead and put the phone in Airplane mode. Youll note that I can still do things like search for places even autocomplete still works. Even though Im offline, I can still see their hours and the reviewsFinally, weve been working hard to make Google Maps work offlineTheyve recently launched Offline video support for YouTube. We covered this here.Were working hard to support offline capabilities in Chrome. This means youll be able to save any page  like this delicious recipe for egg biryani  for later use, offlineStarting in indonesia, theyre optimizing search pages for users on slow/limited connections. These pages load 4x faster, using 80% less dataEven with these Android/Chromebook devices, connectivity is often limited  and where it is available, data expensive. With this in mind, were reevaluating how many of our core products work in this areasWeve moved from discussing Android One to discussing ChromebooksAndroid One phones run the very latest version of Android, and are amongst the very first to get the latest softwareAndroid One is now available in seven countries, including India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Phillipines, and as of just a few weeks ago, TurkeyOur Android One effort is all about making high quality, and up to date devices at a great valueAs sundar mentioned, nearly 8/10 of devices shipping run Android. The vast majority of users coming online will be on AndroidWere thinking very carefully about how we evolve both our products and our platform to account for their particular needsMore and more people are getting their first smartphone. For many of them, this is their first computer.Jen Fitzpatrick, VP of Engineering has taken the stageGoogle Photos will launch today on Android, iOS, and WebSupports up to 16MP for photos, and 1080P for videoThere you have it: Google Photos, a home for all of your photos. And when we say all You can now back up unlimitedphotos and video for freeYou can select multiple photos and create a share link; it generates a cross-platform, browser agnostic, no-login-necessary link out of the photos youve chosen to share.Theyve introduced a new gesture for quickly selecting multiple photos at once: press and hold on one photo to select, and then drag across all the photos you want selected.Assistant is largely Google+ auto awesome feature with a better interfaceGoogle Photos will help you create videos and collages manually  but if you swipe to the left, an Assistant feature will offer up suggestions that its already made for you. A timelapse of recently taken photos? A montage of your just uploaded GoPro video?Sure enough, its already up on the just launched Google Photos twitter accountHe selects a photo, and tweets it from the share button..Using machine learning, Google Photos can automatically sort photos based on the people and places that matter in your life. I did not tag a single one of them, and these information is private  its for your eyes onlyEverything loads fast; everything feels local. But in fact, not one of these photos is actually on the devicePhotos are sorted day by day, but hes able to quickly scroll back years. By pinching out, hes able to view things month by month; pinching out again, the photos are sorted year by yearNow that thats out of the way, lets open the photos app. The photo we just took is right up at the top, and automatically backed up.To start the demo of Google Photos, theyre taking a selfie.It helps you organize and bring moments to life and makes it easy to share and save what mattersGoogle Photos is a private and safe place for all of your photos, available from any device.Were here to introduce a brand new photo experience with Google Photos[Think about all the moments you have; the moments you love, the moments you cherish. The oh-god-forget-that-happened moment]He gives an anecdote of going to his daughters graduation. He took 200 photos; his wife took 300+Anil Sabharwal, Director of Photos has taken the stageIf this works even half as well as this demo, this is awesome.In a nutshell: Now On Tap analyzes whats on screen, and uses that context to answer questions and try to offer up useful information.Shes demonstrating how Now On Tap works within an app.She brings up a menu within yelp, filled with complicated dish names.Okay, google. Show me pictures of [slaughters the dishs name]Okay! Here are pictures of Spanakotiropita(It was able to extract what the user was actually requesting using the context of the on screen menu)When you hold the home button, youre saying Heres something I need help with; heres the contextShe receives a message from her husband. How about dinner at Evia tonight? Oh, and can you pick up dry cleaning?She holds the home button: it brings up ratings for the restaurant, the phone number, and more. It also adds a reminder to pick up the dry cleaning. All of this context is gleaned from whats on screen, on-the-flyShe opens an email, suggesting that they go see Tomorrowland.She holds the Home button; it instantly brings up information about Tomorrowland (extracting that subject right from the email), including a link to the trailer, the cast list on IMDB, and the rottentomato score.Shes demonstrating Now On Tap. She plays a skrillex song in a music app.Okay Google, Whats his real name?Now On Tap recognizes that by his she means Skrillex, extracting that context right from the app shes in.But how can we get you from context to answers as fast as possible?For this, were working on something called Now on TapHow do we do this? This is where Googles knowledge graph comes in pretty handy. The knowledge graph is Googles understanding of the world, and everything in it. It has more than 1B entities.With Google Now, weve built up this powerful context engine  we understand more than 100M places. Not just geography, but what sort of information is useful to you thereLets talk about context. In different contexts, you need different things. What you need at Disneyland is very different from what you need sitting around on a lazy sundayTo assist you, we need to do 3 things really well:
 Understand context
 Bring you answers proactively
 Help you get things doneSince we first launched, weve brought more and more useful information to you. The last train of the night; a new open house in your neighborhood. Today, I want to talk to you about whats coming nextWere on to talking about Google Nownow.For example: in 2013, speech recognition accuracy had an error rate of ~23%. Today, its at 8%Sundar is explaining how Googles machine-learning and image recognition has gotten so much better in recent years using deep neural networksWeve moved on to discussing search on mobile, and Googles current efforts there.Theyre providing a unified home for connected IoT devices, as pictured below. Devices can be grouped by room, purpose, etc.Brillo and Weave are independent and cross platform, allowing device manufacturers to use either or both .Theyve also built Weave, a standardized communications protocol for Internet of Things devices. For example, a camera can say Im taking a picture and any device around it should be able to understand what that means.Given that its based on Android, it already has scale; many, many manufacturers can already work with itBrillo is derived from Android, but built with minimal system requirements. As a result, it already has things like BTLE, WiFi, etc built in.Today were announcing Brillo, the operating system for the Internet Of ThingsWe pulled in people from the Nest and Android teams to build an end-to-end solution for the internet of things. We needed to build a operating system, a means of communication, and a user experienceWe see a range of possibilities; we think its endless. But there are a whole lot of challenges. Its really hard for device manufacturers, just like in the early days of smartphones, to build that whole software stack.Were moving on to a discussion about the Internet Of Thingswith Sundar returning to the stageToday, were happy to announce that there are already more than 4,000 apps built specifically for AndroidWearHe demonstrates a few existing AndroidWear apps: Shazam, Uber, Nest, and more.With AndroidWear, developers are free to write code that runs directly on the device [with access to all of the sensors inside]Yep. Thats exactly what theyre demonstrating  the AndroidWear build we covered a few weeks back. The audience goes crazy for the wrist gestures and emoji doodling. They need to read TechCrunch more.Sounds like hes describing the update we covered here, with its wrist gestures, emoji recognition, and new user interface flowFor starters: Android Wear devices feature always-on devices. In our latest release, we brought this ability to apps, as wellOur latest release of AndroidWear, which will roll out in the coming weeks, takes this concept everywhere.Today, were announcing something even better  and were taking our inspiration from something we already do: checking the timePerhaps the best part: every time we make these improvements, we can push these to existing devices. When you buy a Wear device, you know it gets better over timeIn the last year, weve launched 4 major AndroidWear updates, with features like GPS, offline music, and 3rd party watch facesFor the last year, weve been making key platform investments to enable truly powerful appsEarlier this morning, you heard about our growing set of watches, watch bands, and watch facesWere on to talk of AndroidWearSmaller things in Android M: Highlighting now selects words on a word-by-word basis, rather than letter by letter. Once a word is selected, you can scrub back letter by letter
 Simplified volume controls (you can now control volume for ring, music, and alarms independently)
 A floating clipboard (for things like copy/paste) that appears above highlighted words.USB C support for Android devices is incoming. Coming to a phone near you, soonThey put Android M on a Nexus 9; compared to Android Lollipop, it ran 2x longer in standby thanks to doze mode.With M, Android uses significant motion detection to detect if a device has been moved recently; if not, apps can automatically be shifted into doze mode. In doze mode, they use less data and more battery.Were changing Android to be smarter about power with a new feature called Doze'Last key feature of Android M:Power and ChargingDave demonstrates a user making a purchase within the Target app using their fingerprintYou can use the fingerprint reader support to unlock the device, make Play store purchases, and there will be an open API for developers to useNext key feature of Android M: built-inFingerprint reader support, which works hand-in-hand with Android PayAndroid Pay also works within apps, for those apps that sell physical goods/services  etsy, chipotle, uber, lyft, and more were mentionedAndroid Pay will work with any Android device with NFC, and work at any retailer with contactless payments (Mcdonalds, Jamba Juice, Game Stop, Wholefoods, etc)Your credit card number is not shared with the storeJust unlock your device, hold it up to a reader, and youre done. There is no need to open an appAndroid Pay is focused on simplicity, security, and choiceNext key feature in M: Mobile Payments with Android PayApps can now verify that any application claiming to support a link-type are the actual application that its developers meant to open.Next key feature in M: App Links (linking from one app to another app)Dave demonstrates Chrome Custom Tabs within Pinterest. He clicks a link, it appears above Pinterest, but still within the pinterest app. Its branded with the same colors as the pinterest app, and Pinterest was able to add a pin this button to the headerDave: Chrome Custom Tabs is a new feature that lets you harness all of Chromes functionality, while still maintaining the look and feel of your app.Dave: Today you have two options when a user clicks a link in your apps: boot them to a browser, or send them to a web viewNext key feature coming to M:Web experience improvementsLegacy apps, built before M, will behave as before (so dont expect the new permission model in all/most apps at first)You can also go into app settings and modify/toggle permissions for each app after the factIts similar to the way iOS does it, currently. The app wants to use the microphone? Bam, a prompt appears.Android will now ask for permissions the first time an app tries to use something (like the camera, GPS, microphone), rather than when you download.[With M], you dont have to agree to permissions that dont make sense.First up: App permission changesLet me take a few minutes to walk you through 6 key areas weve improved AndroidDave Burke takes the stage to demonstrate Android M, the next version of Android.Sundar brings up a slide that says, simply, M Developer Preview, suggesting that an Android Version M dev build is coming shortly. The crowd goes crazy.News: HBO Now is coming to Google Play17M Chromecasts have been sold, 20k Chromecast apps now availableSundar: And Android TV; last year, we shipped a reference model. Today, Sony and others are shipping tvs with AndroidTV built in.Sundar: We announced Android Auto last year. Just last week, Hyundai announces that their Sonata is in dealerships now. [Many other manufacturers are preparing cars for 2016]Sundar: With Android Wear, we started with 2 models; today, were up to 7Sundar: Today, were going to talk about how were taking computing beyond mobile. Last year, we talked about how were taking Android to many, many form factorsPichai also notes that there are more than 1 billion users each for Search , YouTube, Gmail, Android, and Maps around the world.Sundar: Behind me, youll see a single dot for every active Android phone out there.
As youd expect, the screen fills with lots of dots. Lotsand lots of dots. They come together to form a globe.Sundar: Last year, 8/10 phones that shipped were based on AndroidSundar: Lets get started with AndroidSundar: Weve solved many problems. We thought, Why does email have to be so slow?. So we built Gmail. Then Maps. Then Chrome. Then Android.Sundar: At Google, we build for everyone in the world. We look at technology and see how we can make a difference to a fundamental problem in peoples livesSundar: This is of course the moment of mobile, of the smartphone. Since last years I/O, there have been over 600M who have adopted smartphones.Were popping into live streams of people watching the I/O stream around the world  first Mexico City, then Munich, now Juja in Kenya.Welcome to Google I/O 2015. Thank you for joining us today. Were being joined by over 2M people on the live stream; welcome to them, as wellThe countdown finally resumes. Sundar Pichai has taken the stageEvery clock in this simulated 3D internet world is stuck on 7, for some reason.The countdown got stuck at 7, opening to some strange 3d world. Theres a reddit alien! And a Twitter bird! Oh, its supposed to be the Internet.Were switching from simulated countdown to simulated countdown, but the general idea: countdown.Now the projection screen is simulating going down an elevator, counting down from 60..Earth appears. Crowd goes nuts. EAAAAARTH!!!! they roar.Were flying through our own galaxy now. Bet you were flying to earth!Space trip.Stiiiilll flying through space, here.Still flyin through spaceThe panoramic screen has us flying through spaceAnd here we go!Pong-stravaganzaLooks like were going to see the mega-panoramic-screen PONG finals before the show beginsAnd it did not start on timeOne more minute! Theoretically! If it starts on time! Which it oftendoes not! Exclamation mark!All of this, of course, is just to kill time until the keynote actually begins.Which, by the way, should be at 9:30 am pacific.To explain what I mean by massive Pong, this is half of the screen. See where the photo ends on the left side? Thats where the left players paddle is.The players are standing in the center of the room, controlling the game from what looks to be a smaller screen. Seems pretty impossible, otherwise.Were back to massive, full-room Pong. 15 minutes til the show starts, everyone!The whale has completed its lap around the room.thats what happened here.WHALE!!! WOOOOOThe rube goldberg machine has been replaced by a whale.The room went crazy with applause for the whale.People <3 whales.Theyre playing a song that sounds like something ripped straight out of Mad Max. Because nothing says Rube Goldberg machine like insanely intense fighting music.The lights have dimmed; an animation of a rube goldberg machine is now playing across the panoramic screen that surrounds the room.Waiting is the hardest part.30 more minutes to go! The keynote is scheduled to start at 9:30 am pacific.Giant ping pong as in, ping pong across a panoramic screen wrapped almost entirely around the room. The biggest (and most dizzying) game of pingpong the world has ever seen.Theyre playing giant pong.Podium!Selfie sticks OK here, unlike at WWDC.Theres screens wrapped around the entire room.Were in!They have us waiting in press room ahead with power, wired internet and coffee.Were in, in case youre already watching. This is the secret bonus portion of the show for early viewers.
