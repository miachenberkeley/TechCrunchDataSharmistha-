We dont have too many details yet, but Googles CEO Sundar Pichai just let the world know where and when Google I/O will take place this year.I/O'16 coming to neighborhood where it all started 10 yrs ago: Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, May 18-20. More details soon. #io16 sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) January 12, 2016The conference usually takes place in San Francisco at the Moscone Center, but it seems like the company wanted to bring it closer to them  and have it outdoors.The company will no doubt be showing off new hardware and software initiatives like they do every year, but this will be the first event under its Alphabet overlords and with Pichai at the helm.Why a developers conference outdoors? Well, maybe well see Google Wing in action, or some drones, or Loonor ya know, self-driving cars. And maybe Dave Matthews Band? A boy can dream.The Shoreline Amphitheatre can hold up to 22,500 people and fun fact, its marked as permanently closed on Google.
