Google may be preparing a consumer virtual reality headsetfor a release as early as this year that defies existing categorizations anddoesnt relyon a PC or mobile phone as the central brain, the WSJ reports.Rumors have been bubbling up on the companys VR hardware ambitions overthe last few weeks. The Financial Times reported a few days agothatGoogle would be releasinga mobile-based Samsung Gear VR competitor in the near-future, possibly at Google I/O in May.TheWSJ report today suggests that Google will be building thisuntethered headset utilizing high-powered chips from Movidius that will power the device and its associated head-tracking technology made possible by external cameras.Interestingly, Movidius just announceda partnershipa couple of weeks ago involving its Myriad 2 processing platform, detailing that the company was working with Google to bring machine intelligence to devices.The technological advances Google has made in machine intelligence and neural networks are astounding. The challenge in embedding this technology into consumer devices boils down to the need for extreme power efficiency, and this is where a deep synthesis between the underlying hardware architecture and the neural compute comes in, said Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane in the blog post from last month.There have been other significant movements from Google in the past several months on the consumer side of virtual reality, though most have been devoted to more broad platforms like Cardboardand Project Tango, which give third-partyVR and AR hardware manufacturers and content creators asystem to build upon.While Project Tango is still in its earlier stages with Lenovo currently building some of the first Tango devices to be releasedthis summer, Google Cardboard is already strapped onthe faces of eager consumers who have ordered5 millionof the bare-bones devices.These rumors also come in the wake of some interesting changes at the company over the past several weeks.Clay Bavor, GooglesVP for Product Management, left his work on other Google products to exclusively focus on managingthe companys virtual reality offerings.Some interesting job postings on Googles site also raised questions withpostings detailing a need for aVR Hardware Engineering Technical Lead Managerthat wouldlead a team in building multiple consumer electronic devices while also directing system integration ofhigh-performance, battery powered, highly constrained consumer electronics products.A battery-powered HMD device that isnt attached to a PC or mobile phone would definitely be a major development in an industry largely dominated by developer and consumerdevices situated at either end.For a company like Google, with such clear ties to the mobile ecosystem, at first impression this feels likea bit of an odd move to me. Mobile VR offers major accessibility to users that are already sporting well-powered smartphones and tethered VR offers an unparalleled experience that prioritizes crazy resolutions and rapid frame rates.We may just have to wait and see. While the WSJ reports that the device could be coming later this year, other sources told the paper that the development was in its early stages and Google could still choosenot to releaseit.
