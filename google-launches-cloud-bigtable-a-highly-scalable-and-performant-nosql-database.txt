With Cloud Bigtable, Google is launching a new NoSQL database offering today that, as the name implies, is powered by thecompanys Bigtable data storage system, but with the added twist that its compatible with the Apache HBase API  which itself is based on Googles Bigtable project. Bigtable powers the likes of Gmail, Google Search and Google Analytics, so this is definitely a battle-tested serviceGoogle promises that Cloud Bigtable will offer single-digit millisecond latency and 2x the performance per dollar when compared to the likes of HBase and Cassandra. Because it supports the HBase API, Cloud Bigtable can be integrated with all the existing applications in the Hadoop ecosystem, but it also supportsGoogles Cloud Dataflow.Setting up a Cloud Bigtable cluster should only take a few seconds, and the storage automatically scales according to the users needs.Its worth noting that this is not Googles first cloud-based NoSQL database product. With Cloud Datastore, Google already offers a high-availability NoSQLdatastore for developers on its App Engine platform. That service,too, is based on Bigtable. Cory OConnor, a Google Cloud Platform product manager, tells me Cloud Datastore focuses on read-heavy workload for web apps and mobile apps.Cloud Bigtable is much the opposite  is designed for larger companies and enterprises where extensive data processing isrequired, and where workloads are more complex, OConner tells me. For example, if an organization needs to stream data into, run analytics on and serve data out of a single database at scale  Cloud Bigtable is the right system. Many of our customers will start out on Cloud Datastore to build prototypes and get moving quickly, and then evolve towards services like Cloud Bigtable as they grow and their data processing needs become more complex.The new service is now available in beta, which means its open to all developers but doesnt offer an SLA or technical support.
