Google today launched a new plug-in for Microsoft Office that gives you access to all of your Word, Excel and PowerPointdocuments in Google Drive right from Microsoftsdesktop apps. The plug-in also lets you save files directlyto Google Drive, so you can then edit them in Googles online apps, too.The idea here, a Google spokesperson told us, is to continue to make Drive into more of an integrated storage tool for its users.You could, of course, always use Googles desktop applicationfor Driveto sync locally stored files with Google Drive already, but this new feature makes this a far more integrated experience for Office Users. Once its installed, you can use Google Drive in Office just like any other folder on your computer or network.Last year, Google launched the ability to startdesktop apps right from Google Drive in the browser, too. Todays announcement is a natural next step in bridging the gap between desktop and web.In some way, launching this plug-in is alsoan admission on Googles part that Microsoft Office is still the default productivity suite in many businesses  even in those that already have a Google for Work subscription. Once people have all of their files in Google Drive, though, Google Drive and the Docs, Sheets and Slides apps become the natural destination to also make edits to these documents online and not Microsofts own Office web apps.At the same time, however,Microsoft is making quite a push to get its users to subscribe to Office 365, which comes with the web apps and online storage, too (and its definitely making some inroads into large companies with this strategy).
