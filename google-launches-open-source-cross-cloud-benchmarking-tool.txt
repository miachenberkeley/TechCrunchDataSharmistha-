Google today launchedPerfKit, an open-source cloud-benchmarking tool that, in Googles words, is an effort to define a canonical set of benchmarks to measure and compare cloud offerings.The PerfKit tools currently support Googles own Compute Engine, Amazons AWS and Microsofts Azure clouds. Google says it has worked on this project with over 30 researchers, companies and customers, including ARM, Canonical, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Rackspace and Red Hat.As Google points out in todays announcement,evaluating the performance of different cloud services isnt easy. There are a few companies like CloudHarmonythat offer cloud-performance reports (and tools like New Relic obviously let you monitor your existing installs), but none of these take your specific needs into account, and its often unclear howthose tests were performed.Once installed, PerfKit runs about 20 benchmark tests that look at everything from raw CPU performance to more complex database and network benchmarks. Google notes that the tool also tests theend-to-end time to provision new resources in the cloud, something that most other benchmarks cant take into account.To compare the results,the team also wrote a visualization tool (the PerfKit Explorer, which sounds a bit like a Fifty Shades of Grey-branded bondagestarter set).Its coolto see Google launch an open-source benchmarking tool like this. The companyhas long said that it isnt afraid to pitits cloud performance against its competitors. Itll be interesting to see the first cross-cloud benchmarks from this tool, though, to see where it really stands.
