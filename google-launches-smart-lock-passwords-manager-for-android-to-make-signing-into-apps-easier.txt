Google is combining all of its login and identity solutions into a single platform today under the Google Identity Platform moniker. Whats more interesting than that, though, is that Google is launchingthe Smart Lock Passwords Manager today, which will make it easier for users to sign in to third-party Android apps that implement this service.Smart Lock for Passwords is essentially a password manager for Android apps and the web thats built into your Google Account.On Android, this service basically does what Chrome already did on the web, but for apps. Say you want to log in to the New York Times app  which is one of the launch partners for this service. After youve signed in, Smart Lock will ask if you want to save the password to your account. Then, when you get a new device that youve signed into with your Google account, the app will already know your NYTimes password and pre-fill your credentials for you  just like youd expect on a website.Any developer who wants to implement this feature can do so with the help of the new Smart Lock APIfor Android. Google argues that this will help apps and sites increase their sign-up and sign-in rates  and given how annoying it is to enter passwords on mobile, thats probably true.Besides the New York Times, Google also worked with Eventbrite, Instacart, Orbitz, LinkedIn and Netflix to pilot this project. Netflix, it seems, plans to support this on Android TV, too, where entering passwords is also quite a hassle, after all.Google says it plans to addsupport for sync pass phrases on Android  letting you encrypt your passwords so Google cant read them  and the API will soon support other platforms, as well.
