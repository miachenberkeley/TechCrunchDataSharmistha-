With the release of Androids latest operating system, Marshmallow, tons of new functionality is going to be introduced over the next few weeks.One of the more interesting new features rolling out now is the ability to translate text within popular Android apps like WhatsApp. Thats pretty huge if you only speak English and your friend only speaks Russian, for example.Google announced the new feature today, which lets developers bake Google Translate right into their apps with a text-selection behavior.Its pretty sweet and Im sure that well see more apps rolling out with the functionality. Google mentions TripAdvisor, WhatsApp and LinkedIn to start. Travel, chat and business. Makes sense.
