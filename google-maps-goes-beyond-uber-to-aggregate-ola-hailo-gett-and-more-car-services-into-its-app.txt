Google reportedly is working on building its own Uber competitor, and while some believe this will come in the form of a fleet of autonomous cars, there is amore immediate optionfor how Google can position itself more prominently in Ubers world:bysearching and aggregating everything that the wider on-demand transport landscapehas to offer.Today, Googleannouncedits navigation app Google Maps will be addinga new car services tab as a complement to its walking, driving and public transportation directions. It will show fares and riding options from a number of providers in addition to Uber.New partners include 99Taxis in Brazil, Ola Cabs in India, Hailo in the U.K. and Spain, mytaxi in Germany and Spain and Gett in the U.K. They will sitalongside listings from Uber, which was the first service to be integrated into the Google Maps app globally in 2014.Google says the new integrations will be rolling out first on Android, and coming very soon to iOS.While previous versions of the Google Maps app essentially providedan Uber optionat the bottom of a long list of travel routes, Google says that now these services will be shownona dedicated taxi tab in the app.It looks like there are two motivations behind adding these new services.First, it helps position Google Maps as an all-in-one option for people planning a trip somewhere. By giving them private car-hire options, its morelikely they will stay in the app rather than navigating out of itto do something else, possibly never to return to Google Maps again.When youre leaving work to meet a friend for dinner, you can easily compare your options to find the fastest way there, without having to open multiple apps, writes Google engineer Holger Flier.This is a strategyGoogle has been building out for a while now, along with other enhancements, including the option to search for places, read and post reviews and even book tables at restaurants.It doesnt look likecar services are paying to appear in Google Maps, but, as with Googles search business, you can envision a revenue stream built around this longer term.Second, its a way for Google to lay yet more groundwork to position itself as a go-to resource for transportation services. Similar to howGM and Lyfts launch of Express Driverentalswill help the pair lay down infrastructure for anautonomous car fleet down the line, Google is helping shape user behavior that it may or may not decide to capitalize on at a later date with more services of its own.Its a place where Google might even choose to expand its role. When it makes sense, well also show ride service availability when viewing the map in walking and transit directions, and multiple ride services options for each provider  where they exist, Flier notes.The other interesting detail here is Googles use of deep linking in the app. Flier notes that if you havethat providers app installed on your phone already, you can see fare estimates and pick-up times. Select a service, and well take you directly to their app for you to book your ride with one tap. This will also mean more data from specific services, such as Uber, where you will now get options for its whole range of vehicles, fromuberX, uberXL through toUberBLACK.
