A new update to the Google Maps iOS application promises to make it easier to navigate when its dark outside, potentially reducing the risk associated with using the app while behind the wheel. (Not that you should be actively using the app while driving, butadmit it, youre probably guilty of this.) In the latest release, the app has introduced a feature called Night Mode, which opts for a darker display over the glaring white one thats the default look for Google Maps.The idea is that this could improve your night vision, as your eyes will no longerhave to adjust as you switch between the bright display and the dark road ahead.Sure, its a minor feature release, but one that could make Google Maps a safer navigational aid for the millions of drivers who rely on the app instead of an in-dash navigational system.Night Mode is live now on the iOS version of Google Maps, but is already live in the Android version.The update also included a handful of other interesting features, such as the ability to label places to see them on your map and in search suggestions, which offers a more personalized experience, and the ability to edit the captions of photos youve uploaded to Google Maps.But clearly, the standoutfeature  and one iOS users have been asking about for years  is Night Mode.The feature is also entirely automatic, so you wont have to fiddle with your phones settings in order to switch it off and on. Instead, Night Mode will only activate when its actually nighttime  not simply when its dark. (Yes, we confirmed this by testing in a darkened room).Its also only available in turn-by-turn navigation mode, not the default maps interface. In other words, the enhancement will appear right when you need it, and theres nothing else you need to dowell, except update to the latest version of Google Maps, that is.Correction: Night Mode has beenavailable on Android.
