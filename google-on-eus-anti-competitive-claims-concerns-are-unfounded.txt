Were a little over five years into the EUs antitrust investigation of Google, and todays back and forth is about Google Shopping results.Back in April, Europes antitrust chief, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said:Our preliminary view in the SO is that in its general Internet search results Google artificially favors its own comparison shopping service and that this constitutes an abuse. Our investigation so far shows that when a consumer enters a shopping related query in Google search engine Googles shopping comparison is prominently displayed at the top of search results.Google was given 10weeks to reply to the Statement of Objections (SO), which it has. Clearly, the company doesnt agree with the findings of the EUs investigation and went through them piece by piece today in a blog post by Kent Walker, SVP & General Counsel at Google:Weve taken seriously the concerns in the European Commissions Statement of Objections (SO) that our innovations are anti-competitive. The response we filed today shows why we believe those allegations are incorrect, and why we believe that Google increases choice for European consumers and offers valuable opportunities for businesses of all sizes.The post goes on to flip the script when discussing the claims that Google was diverting traffic away from other shopping services and asks the EU what it should do instead: the SO doesnt back up that claim, doesnt counter the significant benefits to consumers and advertisers, and doesnt provide a clear legal theory to connect its claims with its proposed remedy.We dont think this format is anti-competitive.This thing will probably go on for another five years, which isnt necessarily a bad thing. Challenging companies like Google and making them explain how and why theyre doing certain things is good for consumers. While the company is going to be very cagey and careful since this is a legal battle, it is interesting to take a peekbehind the kimono.At the end of the day, Googles defense when it comes to the EUs claims of anti-competitive behavior will be that it behooves the company to make its products and search results the best they can be, because thats ultimately whats best for shopping sites, consumers and Google. The post ends flippantly:We look forward to discussing our response and supporting evidence with the Commission, in the interest of promoting user choice and open competition.Will the arguments hold up? Well see when the EU responds. Probably not, though.
