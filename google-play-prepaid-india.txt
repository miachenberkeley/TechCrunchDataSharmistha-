India is one of Androids fastest-growing markets, but its extremely low credit card penetration rate is a challenge for Google as it goes after sweet, sweet app revenue. The tech giant is taking steps to make it easier for people to purchase from Google Play, however, and the latest is the launch of prepaid voucher cards.The cards, which come in increments of INR 500, 1000, and 1,500 INR (or USD $7.80, $15.60, and $23.40), will be rolled out in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Jaipur over the next few weeks and sold at electronic retail chainsVijay Sales and Spice Hotspot.Google Plays prepaid vouchers can be used to purchase any kind of digital content in the store, including apps, movies, and books.Previously, Google Play customers in India without a credit card had to resort to a number of workarounds, including virtual credit cards issued by banks or purchasing gift card codes from online sellers.While Google Play offers direct carrier billing in many countries with low credit card penetration, India is not currently one of them, but that may change soon.
