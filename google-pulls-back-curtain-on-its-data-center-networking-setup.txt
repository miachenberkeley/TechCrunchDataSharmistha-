While companies like Facebook have been relativelyopen about their data center networking infrastructure, Google has generallykeptpretty quietabout how it connects the thousands of servers inside its data centers to each other (with a few exceptions). Today, however, the company revealed a bit more about the technology that lets its servers talk to each other.Its no secret that Google often builds its own custom hardware for its data centers, but whats probably less known is that Google uses custom networking protocols that have been tweaked for use in its data centers instead of relying on standard Internet protocols to power its networks.Google says its current Jupiter networking setup  which represents the fifth generation of the companys efforts in this area offers 100x the capacity of its first in-house data center network. The current generation delivers 1 Petabit per second of bisection bandwidth (that is, the bandwidth between two parts of the network). Thats enough to allow 100,000 servers to talk to each other at 10GB/s each.Googles technical lead for networking, Amin Vahdat, notes that the overall network control stack has more in common with Googles distributed computing architectures than traditional router-centric Internet protocols.Here is how he describes the three key principles behind the design of Googles data center networks:Sadly, there isnt all that much detail here  especially compared to some of the information Facebook has shared in the past. Hopefully Google will release a bit more in the months to come. It would be especially interesting to see how its own networking protocols work and hopefully the company will publish a paper or two about this at some point.
