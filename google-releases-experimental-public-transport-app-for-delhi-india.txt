Google has continued its focus on India after it introduced an Android appfor navigating public transport in Delhi.The U.S. firm last month announced plans to bring Wi-Fi to Indias train stations, and now this new app addresses another issue with commuting and traveling:actually getting about.Google describes theDelhi Public Transport app, which wascreated by the Google Maps team, as experimental and designed from the ground up to make it easier for Delhi residents to get around on public transit.The app aggregates public transport information from Maps, and other Google services, and packs them into a dedicated app that lets you look up Metro and bus timetables and directions, plan routes, check schedules and receive news updates aboutservice issues.The app is small  less than 1MB  and information can be saved offline. Those two very deliberate design details help it to cater to all potential users, regardless of their type of smartphone (Android leads by some way in India on marketshare) or the quality of their internet connection.As someone who has lived in Asia and travels the region regularly, Im hugely encouraged by this new app. Google Maps is already a must  where it can be used  but local apps like these have vast potentialfor locals and visitors alike. Its refreshing to see Google using tech to address everyday issues in emerging markets, hopefully theres a lot more to come beyond this.If youre in Delhi, or planning to visit, you can grab the app from the Google Play Store here.
