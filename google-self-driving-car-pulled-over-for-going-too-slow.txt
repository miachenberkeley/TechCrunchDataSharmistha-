The internets lit up today when someone posted a photo of a cop talking to someone in a self-driving car. Yep, it got pulled over.Why? According to Google, it was going too slow. According to the original poster, the Mountain View police officer didnt get the memo on these things patrolling the streets, so of course wanted to know why the thing was going so damn slow:Yes. We talked to the driver, apparently MVPD doesnt get NEVs and pulled them over to ask why they were all going so slow.And heres the money shot:I mean, I guess its better to be safe than sorry, but damn if 25 miles per hour isnt slow as the slowest mud.BUT HEY. It sure looked pretty, since Google allowed some budding artists to paint the carsred? Well, different colors. And no harm, no foul. Not sure if they got a ticket, but Alphabet can afford it.Theyre actually quite cool, so no harm intended with my Photoshop. Hopefully this event makes it into next months self-driving car report.While we wait, caption this photo in the comments:
