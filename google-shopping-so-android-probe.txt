As widely expected, Europes antitrust chief, Competition CommissionerMargrethe Vestager, has issued a formal Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the operation of Googles shopping search comparison service marking thelatest stepin afive-year long antitrust investigation and an escalation of European anti-competition action against Mountain View.Google now has 10 weeks to make a formal response to the Commissions Statement of Objections.A settlement secured from Google by the prior Competition Commissioner,last year, left complainants unhappy.Google has a hugely dominant share of the search market in Europe, of circa 90%. Complaints about its search business have focused onspecialised search services around particular verticals such as shopping, travel andhotels  where the accusation is that Google displays its own results in a more prominent manner than competitors. Other complaints have related to online advertising and pressures Google may have been placing on advertisersto use Google ads.Investigations into those other areas are still active and ongoing, according toVestager  with todaysSO relating specifically to Google Shopping. And to what she described asthe preferential treatment Google gives its own shopping comparison service in Google search results, which she suggested has been ongoing in a broad range of member states since 2008.Vestager, who is relatively new tothe role  taking over from prior Competition Commissioner Joaqun Almunia last November also announced a parallelformal in depthinvestigation into Googles mobile OS Android, which has been the subject of additionalcompetitioncomplaints from rivals (including Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle), lobbying as a coalition calledFairSearch.org.Their complaint has beenthat Android is a Trojan horse designed to enable Google to dominate the mobile marketplace and cement its control over consumer Internet data for online advertising as usage shifts to mobile. The Commission is now taking a formal look.Google Shopping back in the spotlightSpeaking during a press conference held todayin Brussels, Vestager said: Today we have adopted a Statement of Objection to Google. It outlines our preliminary view that Googles favorable treatment of its comparison shopping service is an abuse of Googles dominant position in general search.Google now has 10 weeks to response, and of course I will carefully consider the response before deciding how to proceed.Our preliminary view in the SO is that in its general Internetsearch results Google artificiallyfavors its own comparison shopping service and that this constitutes an abuse, she added.Our investigation so far shows that whena consumer enters a shopping related query in Google search engine Googles shopping comparison is prominentlydisplayed at the top of search results.She made it clear that she is not looking for a particular tweak to Googles algorithm, or to enforce a particular screen design  the latter being the type of settlementAlmunia had sought  but rather saidshe is seeking to work with principles that can be futureproofed.To be clear, we do not wish to interfere with screen design, with design choices with how things are represented on the screen as such, or how the algorithm works. Rather whatwe would like to see is that consumers are certain to see the best comparison shopping results, she said.As it stands, Vestager asserted that consumers using Google search for shopping comparison are always being pushed towards Googles own comparison service, regardless of whether it is the best or more relevant result for their query. Thats the behavior she wants to see modified.Dominance as such is not a problem, not in general, and not under EU law. However dominant companies have a responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition either in the market where they are dominant or in neighboring markets, she noted.I think it is important to rethink how this can be solved, Vestageradded, responding to a specific question about the type of solution shes seeking. This is why I state that Im looking for something based on principle, and therefore hopefully being futureproofed, because we cant meet like this every six months. That would not make sense.The design of the screen that meets you is also an innovative process  and for me I think it would be better to find something based on principle, being future proof, than being based on a certain look on the screen. Because that could hamper innovation as well. But I am very, very open to solution as long as they address the concerns that we have. That there is a conduct that hampers consumers choice and also innovation in general.Asked how many years the Google Shopping investigation might take, Vestager would not put a timeframe on it  saying only that it is the start of aprocess that could take some time.This is a Union built on law and therefore I think sometimes one had to also accept that it takes some time for the court to decide eventually, both for us and also the for the companies in question, she added.Askedabout the Commissions willingness to pursue a fine against Google, Vestager emphasized that every road is open at this stage  meaningboth further formal discussion proceedings towards finding a solution, but also the ultimate threat of a fine if Google cant satisfy the Commission.I would like to hear what Google has to say for itself, she added. This is the point where things are open, and therefore we should not close any doors.Android under scrutinyOn the Android probe,Vestager said the Commission has received a number of complaints relating to Googles mobile OS, and would be focusing its investigation on three areas of concern:An internal Google memo responding to the EUs antitrust complaints leaked yesterday.In the memo Googles General Counsel Kent Walker asserted the company has a very strong case, telling staff:An [Statement of Objections]is not a final finding. Its a document in which the Commission staff sets out its preliminary arguments so that the company in question can respond.Expect some of the criticism to be tough. But remember, its also an opportunity for Google to tell our side of the story.We have a very strong case, with especially good arguments when it comes to better services for users and increased competition.It should be noted that Google is a sophisticated media operator, with muscular lobbying machinery, so its highly likely it leaked the memo intentionally, as it gears up for a fresh war of words with Europes regulators.Google has now publicly rebuttedthe competition complaints against its search processes here, and Android here.Googles early defenseappears to be focused on arguing there is increased consumer choice when it comes to searchservices, with the company noting: While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways  and allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark.In response tothe Android probe, Google notes that its Android partner agreements are voluntary. The Android model has let manufacturers compete on their unique innovations. Developers can reach huge audiences and build strong businesses. And consumers now have unprecedented choice at ever-lower prices. We look forward to discussing these issues in more detail with the European Commission over the months ahead, Google adds.Vestager said she has prioritized the long-running Google antitrust investigation since taking up office, ensuring the case has been updated to reflect what she noted is a fast-paced market, and meeting with formal and informal complainants, as well as with Google itself.She would not disclose what ground her private discussions with Googlehas covered thus far, noting that the SO takes the investigation into a new phase  where Google will be able to formal respond and defend itself.Thats exactly why this point in the investigation is important. Now we have the Statement of Objection, now we go into a different phase, where Google can defend itself  as they should. Both answer our SO within 10 weeks and ask for an oral hearing, which of course will enable a completely different way of talking about it, she added.She also made a point of noting that one in four of the individual companies involved in the Google Shopping complaint are U.S. companies  doubtless hoping to steer off accusations of anti-U.S.sentiment.Earlier this week the EUs digital commissioner, Gnther Oettinger, made a speech that was interpreted as a swipe againstU.S. tech giants whose platforms have come to dominate the consumer web. The WSJreportedOettingers comments as a call to regulate Internet platforms in a way that allows a new generation of European operators to overtake the dominant U.S. players  albeit he was specifically calling for future Internet platforms to be more open and interoperable, and based on standards with a significant contribution from European industry.
