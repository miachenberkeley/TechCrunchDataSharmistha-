Google announced today that it willbegin testing an experimental feature will allow presidential candidates to respond to issues brought up duringthe Republican debate in real-time directly in Googles search results. The search company says the feature is meant to level the playing field as it lets the candidates share their ideas or positions  even if they didnt have a chance to on stage.The feature isone of several Google is rolling out in partnership with Fox News Channel in advance of the final Republican presidentialdebate, airing Thursday on the Fox News televisionnetwork.According to Google, political search interest spikes 440 percent during live televised debates as voters look for more information on the candidates and their platforms. But the problem with live debates is that not everyone gets to present their full positions  or in some cases, even address the same question as another candidate.With the new real-time search feature, that will change. When web searchers type in Fox News debate as soon as the debate begins at 7 PM on Thursday, theyll be presented with all the candidates positions on the issue being discussed.Explains Google,the campaigns will be able to publish long-form responses as text, and can choose to add photos and videos. This will give each candidate the ability to present their own ideas, as well as give extended responses, answer questions they didnt get a chance to on stage, and rebut their opponents.The features play into the growing trend of second-screen usage that takes place today while watching TV. That is, viewers often watch the show while also using the web or social media to look up more information, share opinions, or see what others are saying.This is something Twitter has capitalized on in particular, through the use of hashtags which let users quickly find all the chatter about a given topic.In Googles case, however, its turning to keywords not hashtags to surface these real-time responses.Its also notable that Google is testing how its own platform can be better used to surfacereal-time information. The move follows on last years news of the companysrenewed search dealwith Twitter to integrate tweets back into Google search results on both mobile and desktop.Now it seems as if Google itself wants to supersede Twitter in some cases, by hosting the real-time responses itself, instead of just pointing to a third-party service.In addition to the integrated candidates responses, Google also announced a couple of other tweaks its making to help web searchers find political information on the web.During the debate, Google will spotlight key insights from Google Trends that offer insights about the candidates and their issues.For example, Google may point to things likequestions asked about key issues to trending terms and rankings. This will give web searchers immediate information on how others are reacting to the debate, for example. And Google says it will ask polling questions, too, directly in Google search which Fox News will then use on air.Thats another thing that Twitter today offers  it even rolled out its own polling feature this past fall.The overlap between the two companies products in this areamakesis especially interesting, given Twitters recent turmoil and the ongoing discussions about whether it makes sense for Google to acquire the social media serviceas its entry way into social, after Google+ spectacularly failed.Finally, Google notes that YouTube creatorsNabela Noor, Mark Watson, and Dulce Candywill get the chance to askthe candidates questions of their own at the debate. This is something thats been done since the 2008 election. While the idea is to open access to politicians to the wider community, sometimes these YouTube personalities waste their chance when chatting with politicians by asking them to weigh in on silly topics. (Like when YouTube starAdande Thorne, aka Swoozie, asked Obama how a dog would wear pants.)All these features will go liveat 7 p.m. ET on Thursday. The primetime debate begins at 9 PM ET on the Fox News Channel.
