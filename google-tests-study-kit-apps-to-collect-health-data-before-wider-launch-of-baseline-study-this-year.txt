In July 2014, Google announced Baseline Study, a Google[x] moonshot that involvescollecting and analysing diagnostics from people to paint a picture ofwhat it means to be healthy. While Baseline Studystartedas a limited pilot with Duke University and Stanford University in July 2014 with 175participants, TechCrunch has learned that Google is now preparing for the next stage of the project: a biggerlaunch for later this year.As part of that, the company has confirmed that it istesting something called the Study Kit, thefirst appsthat are being usedto collect data.Study Kit comes in the form ofiOS and Android apps as well as a Chrome extensionall of whichare currently only opento a limited number ofregistered participants in the Baseline pilot.We are in the early stages of designing the Baseline Study and are exploring ways to make it easy for participants to share their health information and habits with researchers on a routine basis, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. An app is one route were considering and some of our pilot participants are testing this early version. From what we understand Study Kit is aworking title and itmay change.The Study Kit apps actually first appeared around the end of March, butpeople were left guessing as to what they were.Some believedthey were Googles answer to Apples ResearchKit open-source project, which lets medical nonprofits and other organizations set up research projects  say on asthma or Parkinsons Disease. Consumers are thenable tocontribute data to the projects usingtheir Apple devices  a reimagining of the research lab, in a sense.In actuality, thebigger ambitionfor Googles Baseline Study is at once more singular and more complex-sounding.As it has been detailed so far by the company, Google and its partners are trying toidentify a baseline of healthy, involving not just easily seen diagnostics like heart rate and weight but also more granular DNA sequencing.Armed with this information, you can thenstart to notice how and when individualsstart to deviate from healthy, so that we can tackle potential problemsproactively rather than reactively. Or so the theory goes.It may sound counter-intuitive, but by studying health, we might someday be better able to understand disease, Dr. Andrew Conrad of Google[x], who heads up Baseline Study, notedin a statement at the time of the launch last year. This research could give us clues about how the human body stays healthy or becomes sick, which could in turn unlock insights into how diseases could be better detected or treated.Initially, data for the project was gathered by way of blood and urine samples from participants. Theapps are essentiallythe second wave for how Baseline collectsdata.As for the third, afeature in the WSJ notes that longer term,the plan isto use other wearable connected devices to provide data to Baseline, for example special smart contact lenses that can monitor and transmit a persons glucose levels.Contact lenses were singled out as one example of a wearable that would find its way to Baseline in the WSJ article. However, with Novartis, the company behindthecontact lenses, yet to commercialise them, apps for collecting data have yet to be made.Regardless of the wearables timeline, from what we understand, the aim is to launch a more open version of theBaseline Study later this year.Similar to the now-defunct Google Glass Explorer program, future iterations of the Baseline Studycould see the company opening up the project toearly adopters who want to take part in the study; as well as potentially other institutions that might get involved beyond Stanford and Duke.One thing that is pretty clear is that even  or perhaps especially  at this early stage, Google wants to stay well away from theimplication that Baselineis connected to the companys wider business interests in search, advertising, mobile, connected home products, Internet access, payments and whatever else its product and researchteams think of next.Google points out in a two-page description on the study that the intention isto make acontribution to science; its not intended to generate a new product at Google.Thats in part to assuage pretty obvious concerns from people that Google may be collecting data about us that may potentially get used for commercial purposes.On top of that, Baseline will also beoverseen by independent boards, that will vet how data is used, and assure that it remainsanonymous and solely for Baseline research.Thanks to Kyle at Pillabfor the initial spot of the Study Kit Chrome extension.
