Google confirmed its now running a limited promotion in the U.S. dubbed Tap 10, which is aimed at increasing usage of its Android Pay mobile payments service, a rival to Apple Pay and others. Some Android users are being gifted rewards like a free Chromecast or free songs, movies, or subscriptions on Google Play in exchange for using Android Payatlocal stores.The name Tap 10, meanwhile, refers to the promotions goal of getting users to make 10 such mobile payments before the promo wraps up, which will be at the end of next month.A number of Android blogs recently reported on the promotions existence, citingtip-offs from readers, or pointing to the programs terms, including sites like Android Police, Android Central,Android Authority, and more.A spokesperson for Google says the companydid not make a formal announcement about the new program because its a small program currently being tested with a limited set of users.That backs up what the blogs were claiming  that only some users were seeing the invitation to participate in Tap 10. What wasnt clear, however, was how these users were being chosen. We understand now that there isnt any formal criteria involved  the testers are being picked at random.In other words, insteadof being the early stages of a larger rollout of anAndroid Pay promotion, this is a more limited test aiming to determineif offering rewards willactually translate into increased Android Pay usage. That being said, Google does hope that it will be able to offer more promotions like this in the future.The problem that Google faces, as well as Apple for that matter, or any mobile payments provider, is not just one of availability of point-of-sale terminals that accept NFC-based (aka tap-to-pay) payments. Today,a good number of retailers accept NFC payments, and many are listed as specifically supporting Android Pay, including names like Babies R Us, BJs, Bloomingdales, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Express, GameStop, Foot Locker, Macys, McDonalds, Office Depot and others.Google says that Android Pay is now accepted at over a million stores across the U.S., in addition to mobile applications.However, its challenging to change deeply ingrained consumer behavior at point-of-sale. After years of swiping, its hard to make a shift to tapping  not that tapping is difficult, but because old habits are hard to break.For example, a year after Apple Pays launch, studies have indicated that usage has declined. iPhone 6 users who say they used Apple Pay every chance they get fell from 48 percent in March 2015 to 33 percent in June, said one report.And those who said they rarely considered using Apple Pay grew from 17 percent to 23 percent at the same time.To some extent, the decline could be contributed tospotty acceptance; while there are a growing number of supported terminals in the U.S., tap-to-pay isnt available everywhere the way swiping is today. But consumers saidtheir top reason for not using the mobile payment option was simply because they forgot.While that study examined Apple Pay one year in, the same sentiments and issuesare likely shared by Android users. And thats what Google is hoping to change with the Android Pay Tap 10 promotion.To create a new habit, however, it will take more than 10 taps (it may take manymonths, in fact)  but at the very least, just remembering that theres a chance to wincould helpsome Android Pay users not forget that tapping to pay is an option.This isnt the first time Google has linked Android Pay with a program aimed at boosting usage. Over the holidays, Google ran a promotion which saw the company donating to charity for each Android Pay purchase.(Image credits: Android Police; Michael Lipson via Android Police)
