On stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, Google Ventures Bill Maris sat down withour own Alexia Tsotsis to dig into his firms investments and discuss whether Peter Thiel takes too many supplements in his quest to break the law banning life after 120 years.Asked aboutUbersprivacy flaps, Maris walked around the question by merely saying that itisnt just the fastest-growing company that Google Ventures has invested in, but also that it is the fastest-growing company that his team has ever seen.Maris said that he felt content with what Uber is doing to sort the privacy question.According to the venture capitalist, Google Glass is not dead. That matches what weve heard from others, as well.Shown a picture of himself standing next to two billionaires (Maris is not a billionaire, he made plain on stage) all three wearing Google Glass, Maris said that he is not embarrassed by the bets that Google has made. He couched that point in a standard riff concerning the need to take risks to move technology forward.On Google Ventures, Maris said that the group is still growing. The managing partner disclosed that Google Ventures had recently opened an office in London and hired four new partners.On the topic of health, Maris downplayed talk about increasing lifespans that wasnt grounded in science. He also said that it is possible that humans will cure cancer inside of a few generations. Perhaps Maris can team up with Chris Dixon to increase the distribution of Soylent.
