Google appears to be doubling down on virtual reality as they look to begin buildingmultiple consumer hardware devices, according to new VR job postings on their site.Googles current consumer VR offerings are confined to its Google Cardboard program, which allows consumers to experience rudimentary virtual reality with a simple system involving cheap headsets attached to smartphones. Now it appears that Google is working on hardware devices that do more than just act as bare-bones viewers for smartphones.Googles VR ambitions were just in the news last week whenClay Bavor, itsVP for Produt Management, left his work on other Google products to exclusively focus on managingthe companys VR offerings.The new job postings, first discoveredby RoadtoVR,give a variety of hints suggesting Googles future VR plans. Thisposting (for a Hardware Engineering Technical Lead Manager, VR)points to the employee leading a team in building multiple consumer electronic devices whiledirecting system integration ofhigh-performance, battery powered, highly constrained consumer electronics products.As the Hardware Engineering Technical Lead Manager for the consumer hardware products, you will drive the design and execution of our ever increasing product portfolio. You will be responsible for the building multiple CE devices and will put together the right team that will scale with our product offering.A posting for a PCB Layout Engineerfor VRdetailsthe development andsustaining of actual products, while also discussing the hardwareteamsoverall mission in regards to the devices.Google custom-designs hardware for consumer electronics applications. The Hardware Engineering team ensures that this cutting-edge devices are reliable and robust. As a CAD/PCB Layout Engineer on the hardware team, you will be working on fast-paced boards for consumer devices.The company currently has over a dozen hardware and software-focused positions centered on the companys virtual reality efforts.Essential to noteis how all of this falls when considering Googles massive Magic Leap investment. The augmented reality wearable company has not given the public a look at what its been working on (other than the very interesting/mysterious YouTube video below) but Google has shown a majorinterest in its technologies; Googleled the companys massive $542 million Series B inOctober 2014.While Magic Leaps AR tech seems to be more of the Hololens variety, it seems interesting that the company is simultaneously investing such major resources in that company, especially as Magic Leap is reportedly raisingan even larger $827 million funding round.The production of dedicated VR consumer devices would be huge as Google has mainly focused on venturesseeking to promoteVR content production from others,like its Jump VR platform.Its unclear whether all of this points to a Samsung Gear VR-style device that is compatible witha greater slew of Android devices, a dedicated HMD or a device that isnt even a headset.The tidbit about the devices possibly being battery-powered certainlyseems interesting, and appearsto limit suggestion that Google might be building a dedicatedHMD offering similar experience to those fromOculus, Sony and HTC.Googlewas not immediately available for comment.
