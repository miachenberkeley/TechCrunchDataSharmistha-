Google announced its new messaging appAlloat itsI/O developers conference today, and it looks pretty cool. Its a feature-rich interface with graphics anddoodles, and it works with Google Assistant to make suggestions and schedule plans. Allo even has an option for users to send their messages using end-to-end encryption, a security feature that has become increasingly popular and isthe default in other chat apps like WhatsApp and Viber.Butthe full-service experience Allo offers is at odds with the encryption its offering. In order for Google to add dinners with friends to your calendar or suggest replies, it needs to be able to read your messages  which it cant do if your chats are end-to-end encrypted.Allo, then, offers users a choice: privacy and security or entertainment and interactivity.Most consumers will likely choose the latter, leaving security by the wayside, and civil liberties advocatesare already voicing displeasure about it.Making encryption opt-in was a decision made by the business and legal teams. It enables Google to mine chats and not piss off governments. Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) May 18, 2016As the ACLUs Christopher Soghoian points out in the tweet above, government agencies are probably a bit happier with messages being encrypted by choice rather than by default.The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have complained that default encryption causes them to lose access to important communications they need in order to secure criminal convictions. If encryption isnt a default, suspects may forget to turn it on and accidentally leave their messages exposed to law enforcement.But thosewho choose toturn on Allos encryption, dubbed incognito mode, will be getting a highly regarded security protocol: Google partnered with Open Whisper Systems to use the companys Signal Protocol. Signal Protocol also forms the backbone of WhatsApps and Signals encrypted messaging.
