VC firm GV (ne Google Ventures) has made another investment in Europe  its seventh  leading a $21 million Series B round for epigenetic sequencing techcompany and Cambridge University spin-out, CambridgeEpigenetix.The U.K.-based bioscience company makesDNA modification analysis tools for epigenetics researchers  an emerging field of study which looks athow environmental factors and other dynamic/behavioral elements can have a heritable impact, based on how they regulate gene expression rather thanchanging the underlying DNA.As well as GV, CambridgeEpigenetixsaidthe Series B round entailed significant participation from Sequoia Capital. Current investors New Science Ventures, Syncona Partners and Cambridge University also participated. And as part of the round GV general partnerTom Hulme hasjoined theboard.While on the surfacetheCambridgeEpigenetixinvestment might appear a little different to the handful of other investmentsGV has made in Europe to date  which include investing in a music licensing platform, amembers-only travel startup, an email marketing business and a personalized book publisher  the firm confirmed toTechCrunch there is no repositioning ofitsinvestment strategy going on here, either in Europe or globally.Life Sciencehas been a large area of investment for us for the past few years globally, comprising ~30% of our investment dollars. We will continue to invest across Tech and Life Science both in Europe and the US, saidGV general partner Avid Larizadeh Duggan.In Europe, GV has previously invested in the Oxford Science Innovation Fund, which is looking to back high tech business spinning out of Oxford University in the UK  based on researchfrom the Mathematical, Physical, Life Sciences andMedical Sciences divisions. So there is also some past bioscience-related investment to point to coming out of GVs European office specifically.For its part, GVs financierAlphabet (n Google) has long had multiplehealth-focused research interests from moonshots like its project to hack death (Calico) to operating a dedicatedLife Sciences division (n Google Life Sciences; now called Verily) which, since 2012,has worked on various bioscience/tech projects such as synthetic skin ora contact lens to track glucose levels for diabetes sufferers.Verilys questioning mission statement is:How can we use technology to create a true picture of human health?The promise of epigenetics might well be an answer to thatquery  if it leads scientists togain a better understanding of the impact of environmental factors such as stress, diet and toxins on long term human health.And from there you could envisage an era of meaningful quantified health tracking being ushered in  rather than the era of imperfect, and imperfectly understood, data that current wearables and sensors generate. Although, while such developmentsmight obviously intersect with Alphabets bioscience data interests, GV maintains it operates independently of Google/Alphabet, makingits own financially driven investment decisions despite the latter being its source of funding.Commenting on the Series B investment in a statement, Cambridge Epigenetixs CEO Dr Geoff Smith flagged up what he described as itsnew investors unparalleled expertise in building data-driven businesses of substantial value. And whats better than a data-driven business? A business driven by really accurate data, of courseWeve seen how the commercialization of genome sequencing has created incredible opportunities to improve human health, and now the epigenome holds similar potential, added GVs Hulme in a supporting statement. Cambridge Epigenetix is one of the few teams on the planet with the skills and experience to break new ground here, and we look forward to supporting them on that journey.The investment is the first since GVrestructured its European armlast December, switchingfrom having a separate European fund to operating all its investments from a single global pot, while stillretaining its London office and locally based partners.Even before thischange investments being made by GVs Europe office had still required sign off from the US.Andreportssuggested the prior structure led to stalled deals  as of the end of last year GV had made only six investment in Europe, despiteopening its London office back inJuly 2014(while the global fundhas made more than 300 investments in totalsince being founded in 2009). So switching to a pooled global fund arguably simplifies both theinvestment and incentivization structure for GV and its partners. But it remains to be seen whether the pace of GVs investments in Europe will pick up from here on in.
