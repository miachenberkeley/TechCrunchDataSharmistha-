Its the small things that matter, but instead of tapping an image youve found via search and hoping that it loads up like a GIF should on mobile web, you can now view GIFs within Googles official iOS app.Sadly, the animated GIFs dont automatically load and play like this extension makes them do on the desktop.Additionally, this update lets you add a photo or review for local places and get map results in the app when you search for an address.
