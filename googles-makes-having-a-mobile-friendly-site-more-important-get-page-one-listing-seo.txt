If your site isnt easy to useon mobile, Google penalizes it by ranking it lower on its mobile search results pages. To give publishers even more of an incentive to offer mobile-friendly pages, Google today announced that, in May, itwill increasethe importance of having a mobile page, and sites that are not mobile-friendly will rank even lowerthan before.As the company noted when it first introduced this as a ranking signal last year, the basic idea here is to give mobile usersa better search experience. Thankfully, most publishers have heeded the call and now offer pretty decent mobile pages.Google started this effortback in 2014by simply marking sites with a badge that it considers mobile friendly. A few months later, it started using this as a ranking signal, too.Speed has long been one of Googles obsessions, and over the course of the last few months, the companyalso introduced AMP, which makes sites load even faster on mobile.While it doesnt use AMP as a ranking signal today, it does prominently feature AMP pages. Chances are, it will start doing so in the future, though, and over time, it will thenincrease the importance of using AMP just like it did with its first efforts in ranking mobile-friendly sites higher.Google offers a number of tools that let you figure out whether your site is currently considered mobile-friendly and Googles Webmaster Tools feature a full sectionthat highlights mobile usability errors on your site, too.
