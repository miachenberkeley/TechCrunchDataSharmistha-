David Felicissimo is general counsel at Valnet.Googles copyright legal director Fred Von Lohmannannounced in Novemberthat Google would, on the basis of fair use, offer legal supportto a select group of content creators on YouTubethat receive copyright claims.Videos that in Googles view constitute fair use will remain live in the United States and be featuredin the YouTube Copyright Center.Googles announcement comes at atime whenonline content is rapidly moving toward video. According to a recent study by Cisco,video content on the web in 2017 will account for 69 percent of consumer Internet traffic, and by 2019 this statistic will reach 90 percent.Ifyou have recently scrolled through your Facebook timeline or Twitter feed you have likely noticed this transition. Every second post or tweet features aclip,and these companies have made it clear that video will be featured prominently on their platforms. Videos engaging nature and significantly higher conversion ratesis an attractive alternative toplain textforwebsiteslooking toengage and retain visitors.From a legal standpoint,the sheer volume of video being created, uploaded and shared online will significantly change the legal landscape in the world of copyrights, specifically, fair use. For Google, the issueofcopyrightssuddenly took center stage when they decided to launch theirpaid subscription service YouTube Red. Red is working with the largest content creators  such as video gamer Felix Kjellbergof channelPewDiePie,with more than 39 millionsubscribers  to create original programming.The issue is that, unlike Hulu or Netflix, the content used by their largest earners is notoriginal content. Many operate under the fair-use doctrine in using third-party content in their work,be it PewDiePie, reviewing video games or YouTube Channel FunToyzCollector, who earned approximately $5 millionlast year opening and commenting on Disney toys.What this means is that, at any time,the creator is at the mercy of YouTubes automatic takedown system, where a copyright owner can issue a notice and severely hamper a channels ability to operate, as well as the viability of YouTube as a distributor of content.YouTubes creators will often cite fair use in counter notifications;however,the concept is quite complexand requires significant legal analysis,making it very difficult fora creatorto fully appreciatewhatconstitutes fair use.There is no proverbial silver bullet or black and white test as to when fair use is applicable, and creators need to be extremely careful.For Google, defending its newpartnersis paramount for YouTube Red tosucceed. Google is clearly sendinga message to copyright owners who issue takedownswithout considering fair use; by hand-picking cases, they hope to change the legal landscape in defending fair use.The presentprocess on YouTubeallows a copyright owner to issue takedown notices without considering fair use.Further, a copyright owner can take down a5-minutevideo for an image that appears for one second. A copyright owneralso can monetize an entire video based on a single image being used.This arbitrary system has seen channels such as WatchMojo,the 33rd most viewed YouTube channel with roughly60 million views a week, and recently, the popular MajesticCasual,with 2.3 millionsubscribers, bothshut down and later reinstated.It is clear that given the sheer volume of videos being uploaded and shared over the web, copyright owners will need to re-evaluate what to consider as infringement. In fact, in a recent decision (Lenz v Universal Music Corp) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district courts summary judgment, that, prior to sending a takedown notice under the DMCA, a copyright holder must first evaluate whether the alleged unauthorized performance constitutedfair use or they can be held to damages.
