Google launched a new project at its I/O developer conference today that will make it easier for developers tocheck how their mobile apps work on twentyof the mostpopularAndroid devices from around the world. Sadly, the service will only roll out to developers later this year, but if you are interested, you can sign up tojoin the pilot programhere.Its no secret that the diverse Android ecosystem makes life harder for developers, given that they cant simply test their apps onasmall number of popular devices and assume that everything will run smoothly for all users. Most developers keep a few phones and tabletshandy to test their apps on, but few have access to a wide variety of recent devices to test every revision of their apps on.With the Test Lab, developers only have to upload their application to the service and the toolwill automatically work its way through every screen in the app. When the app crashes, the service will generate a crash log and give developers access to a video so they can see what the experience would be like for a user.The service will be built into the Google Play Developer Console. Over time, Google plans to integrate Test Clouddeeper into the development process and  potentially  integrate it with other existing testing services.Its worth noting that Google is obviously not the only player in this market. Xamarin, for example, also runs asimilar testing servicethat tests your apps on 1,000 devices. Prices for that service, however, start at $1,000 per month.Thats far more devices that Google supports, but on the other hand, Googles service will be available for free.
