Easily one of the most exciting areas of Alphabet/Googles future is its self-driving car unit. Today, that group got a CEO with a massive amount of automotive experience. Right now, the company reports to Sundar Pichai and Google, but could be spun out as a company under Alphabet, since its going to turn into a monster of a business for the parent company.Its new CEO, John Krafcik, comes to Google with 10years spent at Hyundai, including five years as its CEO and president. Before that, he was at Ford Motor Company for 14years. You get the idea. Most recently, Krafcik was an exec at TrueCar, which launched at the TechCrunch50 in 2008.Yes, true: I'm joining the Google Self-Driving Car project in late September.

John Krafcik (@johnkrafcik) September 14, 2015Self-driving cars could save 1000s of lives, give people greater mobility & free us from things we find frustrating about driving today. John Krafcik (@johnkrafcik) September 14, 2015Yes, the self-driving cars are cool, but every single person at Google that speaks about them mentions the safety benefits that come along with not having humans behind the wheel. Its that whole saving the world mentality thatbutters up legislators who have to approve testing of autonomous vehicles.Regardless of safety, theres money to be made with the future. Googles setting up a nice little sub-company to take the lead. Its going to need it, with Uber not standing by idly.
