Hey! Have you heard? Theres a new Star Wars movie coming out. Surprise! I know, right? Who knew. Youd think someone would have said something about it by now.Just kidding. Star Wars is on just about everything right now. Really. Walk into a toy store. Star. Wars. Everything.Now its all up in Google.Go to Google and search for A long time ago in a galaxy far far away without the quotes. Or just click this link. Update: curiously, it doesnt seem to work in Firefox. Perhaps its using some trickery that Firefox doesnt support to achieve the effect. If it doesnt work in your browser, try Chrome.BOOM. Your search results, transformed to look like one of the most iconic opening narratives of all time. Be sure to tap that unmute icon in the upper right for the full effect.(And if you dont get why that specific query triggers the egg come on.)Its almost, almost as cool as this Doctor Who easter egg hidden in Google Maps. But not quite.
