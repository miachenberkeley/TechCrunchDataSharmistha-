GrabTaxi, the Uber rival backed by SoftBank, is trialling a next-day delivery service as it experiments withlogistics-related offeringsbeyond its core taxi-hailing business in Southeast Asia.The Parcel-Document service quietly went livein Bangkok, Thailand, this week in partnershipwith e-commerce company AlphaFAST. GrabTaxi customers can summon a courier inside the GrabTaxi application in the same way that theyd order a taxi (see below). The documentwill be delivered the next day if booked before 3pm. It is initially charged at a flat rate:paperwork and documents cost 35 THB (just over $1), while parcels are 35 THB to 70 THB based on size.GrabTaxi works with regular taxis and limousine private hire cars for its GrabTaxi and GrabCar services, but the company is using AlphaFASTs fleet of scooters for this pilot.GrabTaxi actually has a motorbike taxi servicein Vietnam  thats another of its trials  so it seems conceivable that the two could be compatible in the future, should itchoose to launch them in new cities.GrabTaxi declined to comment on record about this experiment, but, since it is leaning on a partner for resources, this looks like a lowrisk way to gaugedemand for delivery services.CEO Anthony Tan told TechCrunch that the firm wouldexperiment with new servicesin the wake of SoftBanks $250 million investment in it last December, and this isone of the first ideas to be floated. Another is Uber-like cashless payments, which is set to be trialled in Singapore.Uber has offered bicycle couriers in New York, but UberRushis yet to expand into Southeast Asia, or indeed any countriesoutside of the U.S..GrabTaxi isnt the only SoftBank-backed taxi app firm to take a leaf from the Uber playbook of late. Ola launched a food delivery service in four cities in Indialast week.Thanks@hipsteryogi
