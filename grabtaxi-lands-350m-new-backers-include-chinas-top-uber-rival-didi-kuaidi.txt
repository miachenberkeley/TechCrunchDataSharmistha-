GrabTaxi, the taxi-hailing app that rivals Uber in Southeast Asia, is getting some big name support from China after it announceda $350 million Series E round from a range of investors that  most interestingly  includes Didi Kuaidi, Chinas largest taxi app firm.The links to Didi Kuaidi dont end there.Chinas sovereign wealth fund, ChinaInvestment Corporation (CIC), which is an investor in Didi Kuaidi, also partook in the round.Coatue Management, an existing GrabTaxi investor, and other undisclosed existing stakeholders provided thecash for the round, which takes GrabTaxi past$650 million in capital raised.Given that Didi Kuaidi was formed by a merger between Chinas top two taxi app companies earlier this yearand just raised $2 billion, are there plans forGrabTaxi to beacquired by Didi Kuaidi? (And thus expand its reach, and battle with Uber, into Southeast Asia?)None at the moment,Cheryl Goh, Group Vice President of Marketing at GrabTaxi, told TechCrunch when we floated this scenario to her. Goh declined to reveal the exact amount of money that Didi Kuaidi, which owns a reported 90 percent of the Chinese market and has voiced interest in expanding overseas, invested.Consolidation seems inevitable in this space, as it was in China. With GrabTaxi and Didi Kuaidi now sharing two investors  SoftBank has stakes in both companies  and Didi Kuaidi a full-blown stakeholder in GrabTaxi, too, it could be thatthe duo have taken their first step towards a future deal. When it comes to an exit, an alliance with a non-competing company with shared interests and investors seems most likely, unless a company like SoftBank or Alibaba decides to buy one out outright  a far longer shot since the taxi app niche is a capital intensive one.At the very least, todaysa clear sign of a strong alliance between Didi Kuaidi and GrabTaxi as both companies continue to battle Uber.As for GrabTaxi itself. Founded in June 2012 in Malaysia, it serves 26 cities across six countries in Southeast Asia. Uber, its chief rival, is present in each of those markets, but GrabTaxi claims that it is leading in each city.GrabTaxi started out connecting its users with licensed taxis, but it has since expanded to cover Uber-style private cars and a motorbike taxi service which is live in Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. In total, the company said it has 110,000 drivers on its platform with 11 bookings made per second. Its mobile apps  iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry have clocked over 6.1 million downloads, Goh disclosed to TechCrunch. (That download figure was 2.1 million back in October.)GrabTaxi said it will use the money to continue to diversify its services (it is testing a courier service in Thailand), and invest in engineering and hiring. Back in April, the company announced a$100 million investment in a state-of-the-art data center based in Singapore, although GrabTaxis CTO  former Facebook engineer Wei Zhu  who headed up the project has since moved on.We exist to solve the regions transportation challenges. Diversifying into private cars andmotorbikes has allowed us to touch people of varying income levels and commuting needs. Weare the only app in the region that has such an extensive network and range of transportationchoices, CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said in a statement.GrabTaxi CEO Anthony TanIts hard to say how GrabTaxi is doing in its battle against Uber because the U.S. firm doesnt provide any business data for Southeast Asia. We asked Uber again, before publishing this story, but it declined to reveal figures for the region.Anecdotally, in Bangkok, the sight of GrabTaxi stickers inside taxis has become common taxis can still pick up regular customers alongside their work with GrabTaxi  but still a large number of people I know ride Uber.Alongside news of the funding, we talked to Goh  GrabTaxis VP of Marketing  to get a little more information about how the company is getting on, and what concrete plans it has.TechCrunch: How many trips per day is GrabTaxi logging per day? Which countries/cities are thebusiest?Cheryl Goh, Group Vice President of Marketing at GrabTaxi: Right now we have around 110,000 vehicles around Southeast Asia in 26 cities over sixcountries. With over 6.1 million downloads of the GrabTaxi app, weve seen amazing growthin every single market and were number one everywhere.Our most active markets at the moment are in Singapore, Malaysia and The Philippines. Wecurrently have around 11 bookings per second which should help you calculate how manyrides we do a day.TC:GrabTaxi has focused solely on Southeast Asia thus far, but are there plans toextend beyond Southeast Asia and into new parts of Asia to keep the growth going andassist with transportation in more cities?CG: We still believe that Southeast Asia has considerable potential to grow and thetransportation ecosystems of the region can be refined further, so were keeping our focuson building our presence here. As we have said before, once we change the way everyonein Southeast Asia commutes, we can begin to consider moving outside the region.TC: You recently extended the GrabBike motorbike-on-demand service into a third city. Are there more launches planned? Might the service extend to logisticsofferings too?CG: Right now our focus for GrabBike is to build a strong network of drivers and grow ourpassenger base as well. There are some markets where motorbike taxis are not feasible, sorealistically we are not considering these markets. If we see a market with suitableinfrastructure and customer-base we will definitely consider expanding into that market.We have a logistics service called GrabExpress, which has been beta launched in Thailand.We believe in testing out new services in markets where we can build a sustainablebusiness that fulfills a genuine need. Our technology centres across Asia are focused onanalysing data and looking at new opportunities that we can explore as we continue to growour business and offerings aggressively.TC: Didi Kuaidi has expanded its service tobuses, chauffeurs and more, while otherrivals have long offer food delivery and other functions  is GrabTaxi planning toenter non-taxi verticals too?CG: We have GrabExpress as part of our services and as mentioned before, we are constantlylooking at what opportunities are available in Southeast Asia. If we see a genuine need fromthe public and we know we can develop a sustainable business, we will consider expandinginto verticals.TC: GrabTaxis CTO recently left the company after just one year. Is there anything toread into this, and how is the search for his replacement coming along?CG: Wei helped us to scale our platform successfully over the one year he was with us and alsoincreased the number of engineers five-fold to 100. He was an important contributor toGrabTaxis growth, but wanted to explore personal pursuits. We wish him the best of luck inhis endeavors.In the meantime, we have appointed Arul Kumaravel as ourinterim CTO, who wasAmazons global mobile lead previously. We have already begun our search for a full-timeCTO.TC:Right now, ride-hailing is a capital intensive business that requires regularfundraising. When do you believe GrabTaxi will become a profitable business?CG: We believe that this is a winner-take-all market and that it is important to invest in growth inthe near-term. We are very blessed to have supportive shareholders who believe in GrabTaxiand want to help us succeed to build the largest mobile platform in SoutheastAsiaTC:Are there plans to make acquisitions with the new funding?CG: We are opportunistic with acquisitions and continue to be focused on growing our corebusiness organically with our strong local team.
