GrabTaxi, the billion-dollar on-demand taxi service that rivals Uber in Southeast Asia, is opening its first office in the U.S. as it seeks to widen its hiring efforts.The growth of unicorns worldwide has made the sight of overseascompanies hiring on U.S. soil fairly common, particularly Indian companies targeting potential returnees home. But this initiative isnt about GrabTaxi moving U.S.-based hires to its Singapore HQ. It already does that. Instead, it is setting up a fully functional engineering officein Seattle which will house a portion of its techand data team on a full-time basis, offeringan alternative location forthose who preferto remain in the U.S. rather than move to Asia.Seattle-based staff will work in tandem with GrabTaxis existing data team in Singapore and its smaller offshoot based in Beijing, China.Seattle is home to Amazon, Microsoft and other tech firms, andGrabTaxi, which is operational in six countries in Southeast Asia and includes SoftBank among its investors,hopes that it can skim that talent pool toboost its ranks.We are excited to announce our new engineering center in Seattle, which will help attract top talent inthe U.S. and expand our global talent reach. As we continue our work on building an on-demandecosystem in Southeast Asia, it is important to look all over the world for innovative ideas and peoplethat will help us continue to succeed in that mission, Anthony Tan,its co-founder and CEO, said in a statement.GrabTaxi said it has already made hires in Seattle, including 23-yearMicrosoft veteranRaman Narayanan, who will lead the office and itsgeneral hiring efforts in the U.S.Narayanan, formerly part ofMicrosofts highly-regarded distinguished engineer program, has joined as Technical Advisor and will work closely withArulKumaravel, GrabTaxis Singapore-based VP of Engineering. (Kumaravel also has a Seattle connection, having previously been Head of Engineering for Amazons mobile platform.)GrabTaxi has been rapidly growing and is working on large scale infrastructure and data problems. Weretrying to solve complex problems using big data and were thinking about hiring talent all over the world,Kumaravel told TechCrunch in an interview. Theres a great talent pool [for these kind of jobs] in the Seattle area.GrabTaxi currently has around 80 engineers located atits new $100 million R&D hub in Singaporewith a further dozen located in Beijing.Kumaravel said there is no specific target for the headcount in Seattle. The company plans tospend 2016 picking out the right candidates to come aboard at its U.S. base.We feel this is an opportunity for people to work on large scale problems, and improve the lives of people [and] make a social impact, he said, when asked what the appeal of switching from U.S. companies to GrabTaxi might be.Thats in fact one of the core reasonsthatNarayanansaid drew him to this new challenge.On-demand services have changed the way people move, commute, shop and consume, and I am excited to be a part of this transformation at such an early stage,he told TechCrunch via email.GrabTaxi has a highly advanced technology platform, and I look forward to helping build a team that will further the development of its cloud computing, storage, big data management, predictive analytics and machine learning capabilities,Narayanan added.GrabTaxi will hope that the challenge resonates with other engineers and data specialists based in the U.S., although it is already getting some help from North America in the form of Lyft. GrabTaxi, Lyft, Chinas Didi Kuaidi and India-based Ola  all of which rival Uber in their respective markets  palled up recently when they announced a global alliance in December.That coming-together will, in time, allow users of each app to use any other alliancecompanys app when they go abroad, butKumaravel said that the collaboration extends to general business knowledgeand information sharing, particularly around engineering and tech.We agreed to share best practices and technology-related work. We regularly share notes with the other companies, he explained.
