Michael Pao, who spent more than four years at the ride-hailing giant Uber, most recently as Head of Product on the companys growth team, has joined the venture firm Greylock Partners as an entrepreneur-in-residence.Paoisa graduate of the University of Pennsylvaniawho went on to nab an MBA at Harvard. Earlier in his career, he spent a couple of yearsin corporate development at Cisco. While at Harvard, Paoalso interned at Quantcast and LinkedIn.We chatted with Pao yesterday and, unsurprisingly, he seems to have learned a whole lot about online marketplaces at Uber, where he helped the company launch in Austin and Chicago.He also spent 20 months as Ubersgeneral manager in Boston before returning to itsSan Francisco headquarters with the task of figuring out ways to help the company extend its reach even faster. (One idea he struck on: delivering ice cream curbside to users who requested it on demand.)Like Greylocks other EIRs  the firmtypically hosts a few at a time  Pao doesnt intend to stay terriblylong, but he does intend to use the time to figure out a new marketplace company of his own to launch. (It probably wont be in transportation, he says. If I wanted to do transportation, the best place is to do that is Uber.)In the meantime, it sounds like Pao willbe advising the firms portfolio companies and working closely with Simon Rothman, a former eBay executive who himself joined Greylock in 2011 as an EIR and was promoted to partner in 2013. Rothmans area of focus:marketplace investments.
