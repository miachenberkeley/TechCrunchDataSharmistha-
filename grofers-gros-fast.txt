Less than twomonths after raising a $10 million Series A from Sequoia Capital and Tiger Capital, on-demand, Grofers, an Indian startup that provides quick delivery of products from local brick-and-mortar merchants, has scored another $35 million from the same investors.The fresh capital, which brings Grofers total raised so far to $45.5 million, will be used to increase the number of consumable items, including groceries, it offers. Last week, Grofers announced the acquisition of My Green Box, a grocery delivery app, for an undisclosed amount, to build its grocery business, which currently accounts for about 60 percent of its transactions.The company has also been using its funds to grow quickly. It currently partners with 400 merchants, up from 250 at the end of February.Co-founder Albinder Dhindsa told TechCrunch last month that many of the merchants that Grofers works with have never sold online before and adding them to the platform is a relatively labor-intensive process because a team of Grofers employees spends about a three or four days taking photos of products and uploading them to Grofers catalog.Grofers claims that the number of orders placed through its apps have tripled over the past month and that the company expects to process more than 20,000 orders in April. The service is currently available in Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai, and will enter Hyderabad and Pune next month.In a prepared statement, Sequoia principal Abheek Anand said We are happy to support Grofers as they build the next generation mobile e-commerce platform. By introducing new categories and cities, Grofers will continue to lead the market and allow the Indian consumer to access an unprecedented level of selection and convenience in their online shopping experience.
