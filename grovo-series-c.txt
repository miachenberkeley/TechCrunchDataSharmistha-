Grovo, a company offering micro-learning content and related technology/servicesto helpbusinessestrain their employees, has raised $40 million in Series C funding.The round was led by Accel (which has been involved since Grovos seed round and led the Series B) with additional fundingfrom previous backersCostanoa Venture Capital, SoftTech VC and Greg Waldorf, plusnew investor Vayner Capital. Grovo has now raised a total of $65 million.The New York City startup has continued to evolve since I wrote about the Series B nearly a year ago, though it still creates 60- to 90-second videos that deliver specific lessons on how to useonline tools likeGmail, Facebook, Twitter, Evernote and Dropbox. (CEO and co-founder Jeff Fernandez, pictured above,has said that creating videos that are briefbut still valuable is all about how you lay out and structure the information.)However, Fernandez told me yesterday that the company has learned that the format isrelatively universal, so its expanded to covermanagement and workplace communication. For example, he said Grovo has created videos on how to listen appropriately to feedback and how to deliver timely feedback.In fact, Fernandez said that Grovo has been developing its own content for internal training, which it plans to release publicly. He didnt want to reveal too much about that content yet, except to say, One ofthe things that is hard for any company, especially fast-growth companies, is effective managerial training.Up next: Adding new kinds of content, including GIFs (like the one above), quizzes and podcasts. The idea of a 90-second podcast might seem a little strange, but Fernandez said the company is sticking to its guns, with content where every word matters and that delivers a discrete amount of information with a specific goal in 60 to 90 seconds. (Grovo will also be bringing the smaller pieces of content together around larger themes and concepts.)And Grovo is looking at international growth, though not necessarily right away.The product has been used in 190 different countries, but Fernandez estimated that 70 to 80 percent of users are still in the United States. He said that releasing international versions of Grovo is absolutely a priority for 2017 and 2018.
