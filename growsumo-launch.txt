Partner programs can be a big source of revenue  for example, channel sales account for 80 percent of Ciscos revenue. Now a startup called GrowSumo is working to make those programs easier to manage, particularly for businesses that dont have Ciscos resources.GrowSumo is part of the current batch of startups at incubator Y Combinator. Co-founder Bryn Jones told me that the team was originally trying to build online collaboration tools, but it turns out that we werent Slack.Even though that first product didnt work out, it made Jones and his team aware of another opportunity. Apparently they had friends in the web development community who wanted to recommend the collaboration product to their clients, buttheir efforts were stymied by the lack of tools that would help them build a real partner program.In order to scale our business, we needed to manage this complicated partner program and there was nothing on the market that supported that, Jonessaid. There were tons of referral marketing tools, like influencer tools, but there wasnt anything that somebody could build their business around.Headded that businesses with a significant partner program will eventuallybuild their own in-house tools, but thatcan cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more to maintain  a big expense for an early-stage startup.So with GrowSumo, a company can create a page where new partners apply to work with them, then train and reward those partners while tracking their progress from a single dashboard. On the flip side, potential resellers can browse different companies on the GrowSumo platform and find products that their clients might be interested in.GrowSumo is focused on businesses that are selling products to other businesses (rather than consumers). Its already working with about 40 companies, including Swiftype, Layer, FreshBooks and Expensify. Jones said that on average, each company works with about 3,000 resale partners  those partners include independent consultants, web developers, human resources representatives and the most popular category, accountants.For another, he said that many of these resellers are not actually hugely incentivized by commissions. Instead, they care about finding products that make their clients happier.Its really about creating a big marketplace, an easy-to-use place where they can discover new business opportunities, Jonessaid.
