In situations where you arentworried enough to call the police, but where youdo want to reach out to a friend and say somethings not right here, freshly launched Guardian Circle has your back.The idea is simple: You add your friends and local contacts to an alert list on the app. If something happens and you need a pair of helping hands, you can sendan alert with varying degrees of urgency. The alertsrange from a request (say, youre at home recuperating from a broken leg and you need one of your friends to pick up some chicken soup), right up to emergency, where you think you may have had something slipped into your drink, or youre worried someone might be following you.Guardian Circle fills the gap between everything is OK and holy crap, Im calling 911The company suggests its appmight be particularly helpful in situations where you need a bit of help from whoever is free and nearby. For example, ifyoure stuck at work and your kid needs a ride home from school, or youre on a date where you feel that something just a little bit odd is going on, and you worry it might escalate to a situation youre not happy with.In effect, it means that by leveraging the power of theirexisting networks, vulnerable peoplecan get help more quickly and easily without having to text half a dozen friends or call 911.The app is free to download and use, but its possible to upgrade to a gold plan for $99 per year, which will include alert room operators for emergencies. In other words, an operator jumps into the conversation and can help callemergency services on your behalf.The app may be particularly helpful to parents who are installing the app for their children; requests such as needing a ride, or a quick way of alerting parents when something scary or worrisome happens could be good use-cases for the app, and a reason to upgrade to the gold plan. Its easy to imagine how those who care for vulnerable adults or people could use the app to help distribute the burden of care, andpeoplewho suffer frombehavioral challenges such as dissociative episodes would benefit frombeing able to alert their friends and loved ones to what is going on.The current version is iOS-only, with an Android version to follow by the end of March.
