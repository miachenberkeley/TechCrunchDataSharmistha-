Yesterday we checked out an event hosted by Lenovo and Google, where the duo announced that Lenovo would be making the first Project Tango Phone.While we found out that the device would ship this summer and cost under $500, we didnt get many other details on the device.However, the company gave us a chance to play with Project Tangos developer kit, which, is a tablet jam-packed with all of cameras and sensors required to runProject Tango.We tried out a few different consumer-targeted apps, including a AR measuring stick, 3D room scanner, and a AR shooting game.While its going to be at least another 6 months before Project Tangomakes it into the hands of consumers, it was nice to see that the technology isprogressing nicely, and will ultimately provide a bevy of featuresfordevelopers working with AR and 3D technologies.
