HotelTonight just launched its newest product, Aces, which is an in-app chat feature connecting users with a personal travel concierge. The concierges, collectively referred to as Aces, are available 24-7 during your booking to do things like make a restaurant reservation for dinner, or get extra towels sent up to your room.If a customer has access to Aces (the product is being slowly rolled out to users in DC, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego and San Francisco) the option to chat will show up on the bookings page starting on the morning of your hotel stay.Last weekI had a chance to try outAces in New York City. My first request was rather innocent, asking my Ace to recommend some options for dinner that night.My Ace (named Emily) quickly responded with a few restaurant options nearby, which wereembedded inside thechat with a picture, rating, and distance of the restaurant from me.While the restaurants she suggested were definitely popular spots, they werent exactly places I wouldnt have been able to find without a quick Yelp search for top-rated local restaurants.Mildly disappointed, I tried one more time and asked Emily to find me a spot that is a bit more unique  something off the beaten path.This is when Ace really shined. Emilyresponded with a few restaurants I (someone living in NYC) had never heard of. Both turned out to be excellent, and places I would have never been to without the help of Aces.One of the most interesting things about this exchange is the informality with which Emily spoke.Our conversation was filled with phrases I would never hear from a traditional hotel concierge.Sheevenused Emojis and would frequently respond to my comments with haha or lol.When I didnt respond to one of her restaurant recommendations, Emily continued to send more details, even triple texting me at one point, which issomething I normally only see from very close friends.While these actions felt weird at first, I quickly warmed up to them as I began to feel like I was talking to a close friend. This element of familiarityalso made it less intimidating to bother my Ace with requests, which could help increase usage of HotelTonights new service.Besides restaurant and outing recommendations, Aces canalso can help with requests that you would typically ask the hotel for directly, like extra towels or a wake up call.If you are inside your hotel room this doesnt have a whole lot of benefit (since you can just call downstairs). However,there is something to be said about firing off a quick in-app message and having a toothbrush appear at your door a few minutes later.As a user, you are given the impression that the whole time you communicate with your Ace it is the same person on the other end. This is reinforced by the fact there is a small picture of your Ace along with his or her name inside the app.For the majority of the day it was clear that my Ace, Emily, was the same person.However, more than 12 hours after I started talking to Emily, the in-app chat still made it appear she was online and hadnt been switched out by a relief Ace.I asked how she could still be working, and in typical Aces fashion received a response joking that they are trained to take power naps in between customers requests.Since Aces is available 24-7, there almost certainly has to be some form of backup from other HT employees. However, the app doesnt make it clear that you are ever talking to more than one person, and a survey emailed to me after my stay only referred to one Ace, Emily.For recommendation requests, HotelTonight says that Aces work in tandem with local insiders like food bloggers and tastemakers who have a deep knowledge of their respective cities. This may change as Aces expands to thousands of cities, but for nowit seems that the advice is pretty hand-curated.The service also uses online advice websites and other HT employees to supplement these recommendations.For hotel requests like a wakeup call or room service, the current method is for the Ace to call the hotel you are staying at. HotelTonight hinted in the future that some automation could be taking place, as it seems pretty simpleto interpret keywords like bring me towels and automatically send a request to the hotel.The chat function also offers pre-written suggestions like can I get my room cleaned or where is the best place to go out tonight which could make it even easier to automate in the future.Sam Shank, cofounder and CEO of HotelTonight, explained that talking to anAce is supposed to be like asking travel advice from a friend who lives in a different city.Shank also mentioned that Aces are trained to look for context of the customers request  i.e offering different suggestions for a business dinner as opposed to a weekend getaway.Once limited to the upper echelon of credit card users, more and morecompanies are beginning to offer some type of free concierge service to their users.This is especially true in the tech ecosphere, where it seems every week a startup likeMagiclaunches with the goal of either beingyour personal secretary orhelping get anything delivered.While this means HotelTonighthas some competition in the space, the Aces service seems to offer a human elementunique from other services.Aces is available now for selected users, andwill soon rollout worldwide to all of HotelTonights 1,800 cities.
