Its hard to believe, but 3Doodler launched thepopularKickstarter for itsfirst plastic-extruding pen almost three years ago.Now, the company is back with the 3Doodler Start,a kid-friendly version of the device that boasts a safe-to-touch design with no hot pointsand a new eco-plastic material that makes building creations safe and fun.The device is available for pre-order now on the companys website for $39.As with most 3D-printing devices, the Startrequires a bit of patience when building from scratch given the new eco-plastic material, but the company has introduced a line of cool little stencils called DoodleBlocks that are included with the Super Mega Pack so that young builders can 3D-print complex inventions from their new device.I sat down with 3Doodler co-founder Daniel Cowen to check out the new device, see what it looks like in actionin the video above.
