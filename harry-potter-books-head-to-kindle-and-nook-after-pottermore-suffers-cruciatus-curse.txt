Interestingly, its biggest parter was Sony, then quite active in the reader space. As The Digital Reader points out, the company licensed the branded, offered a Harry Potter-themed area in Playstation Home and gave away free Harry Potter ebooks with the Sony Reader.Old Draco Malfoy must have gotten a Confundus Charm brewing over there because, after a while, Sony realized that it was hopeless to stem the tide of bigger ereaders and content plays. Sales dropped in March 2015 from 24.8 million to 7 million. The site suffered a loss of 6 million in 2015.So give old Dobby his sock and strap on your House Cup because now you and yours can read Harry almost anywhere, including the Chamber of the Back Seat of the Minivan.
