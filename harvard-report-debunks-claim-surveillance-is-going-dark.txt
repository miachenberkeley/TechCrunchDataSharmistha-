Since the 2013 Snowden disclosuresrevealedthe extent of government surveillance programs its been a standard claim by intelligence agencies, seeking to justify their push for more powers, that their ability to track suspects using new technologies is under threat because of growing use of end-to-end encryption by technology companies.For example, ina speech in fall 2014, FBI director James Comey asserted: The law hasnt kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public safety problem. We call it Going Dark We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do so.More recently, in the UK,the government has claimed expanded surveillance legislation  including a proposal to record and store details of every website citizens visit for a full year  are necessary to plug so-called capability gaps for intelligence agencies. The wording of the draft Investigatory Powers bill even implies that end-to-end encryptionwill stand outside the law since comms providers will apparentlybe legallyrequired to hand over data in a legible form.However a new study, publishedyesterday, by Harvard University and funded by the Hewlett Foundation, debunks the notion that surveillance agencies are struggling with a data blackout. On the contrary, it argues, the rise of connected devices (the so-called Internet of Things) presents massive opportunities for surveillance, bolstered bytechnology companies having business models that relyon data-mining their own users  providing an incentivefor them not torobustly encrypt IoT data.As I wrote last year, when it comes to theInternet of Things and privacy,the riskis that anembedded everywhere Internet becomes a highly efficient, hugely invasive machine analyzing us at every turn in orderto package up every aspect of our existence asa marketingopportunity.Or security expert Bruce Schneier one of the signatories of the report writing on IoT and privacy back in May 2013In the longer term, the Internet of Things means ubiquitous surveillance. If an object knows you have purchased it, and communicates via either Wi-Fi or the mobile network, then whoever or whatever it is communicating with will know where you are. Your car will know who is in it, who is driving, and what traffic laws that driver is following or ignoring. No need to show ID; your identity will already be known. Store clerks could know your name, address, and income level as soon as you walk through the door.The aim of the 37-page Harvard report, which involved contributions from technical experts like Schneier, along with US government counterterrorism officials, civil liberty advocates and Harvard law academics, isto bring a more balanced perspective to the policy debate around surveillance, according toHarvards Jonathan Zittrain (another report signatory), who convened the group,speaking to the New York Times yesterday.We managed to do that in part by thinking of a larger picture, specifically in the unexpected ways that surveillance might be attempted, he said.Discussing why intelligence agencies seemapparently so blind to the surveillance potential ofthe IoT, Zittrain told TechCrunch: I think, as you suggest, its a difference between the capabilities they have right now and what theyre likely to have in the future. Theyre focused on the here and now. Also, law enforcement is grounded in the old telephony model  one app in overwhelming use that can be regularly gone to for surveillance. Something as unruly as todays IoT probably doesnt seem like a good candidate for routine monitoring.But that will change as the IoT space likely consolidates, with a few go-to paths emerging for surveillance. I think thats why its important to think through boundaries on that surveillance now  before it becomes routine. And IoT companies need to take seriously the privacy of the telemetry they receive  and what they *could* receive with a remote tweak to their devices.One notablesignatory on the intelligence agency side is the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew G. Olsen. Although two current senior NSA officials  John DeLong, the head of the agencys Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, its chief risk officer are also described as core members of the group, albeitthe NYT notes theywere unable to signthe reportas they could not act on behalf of the agency or the USgovernment in endorsing its conclusions.The report assertsthat communications in the future will neither be eclipsed into darkness nor illuminated without shadow, emphasizing the role played by commercial companies in eroding data privacy.Market forces and commercial interests will likely limit the circumstances in which companies will offer encryption that obscures user data from the companies themselves, and the trajectory of technological development points to a future abundant in unencrypted data, some of which can fill gaps left by the very communication channels law enforcement fears will go dark and beyond reach, it adds.Corefindings of the reportinclude:The report adds that the various trends it has identified raise novelquestions about how toprotect individual privacy and security in the future  a topic that was also worrying the FTC chairwoman at the start of last year, when shecalled for IoT companies to adopt security by design,engage in data minimization practices, increase transparency and provide consumers with notice and choice for unexpected data uses.Todays debate is important, but for all its efforts to take account of technological trends, it is largely taking place without reference to the full picture, the reportconcludes.That in turn begs the question why governments and intelligence agencies are being so partial in their arguments as they seek to justify expanded surveillance powers. Butif theimperative is to landgrab as much access to data as possible then narrowing the debate to focus on specific technologies such as end-to-end encryption makes sense as away to distract attention from other potential surveillance avenues, such as IoT and location metadata. In other words, its pure misdirection.In any case, whether such incomplete arguments will pass muster with legislators, the judiciary and the general public remains to be seen. But the tug-of-war between technology and politicians will of coursecontinue.
