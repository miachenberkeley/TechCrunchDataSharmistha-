The on-demand cleaning space in Europe just got a little less messy.According to multiple sources, the U.K.s Hassle.com, which also operates in Ireland and France, has been acquired by Rocket Internets Helpling.Bothcompaniesdeclinedto comment. However, TechCrunch understandsthatthis is nowa done deal.That also tallies with what I had been hearing as far back as March. Armed with $45 million in new funding, adding to a $17 million Series A raised shortly before that, Helpling was believed to be embarking on an acquisition spree as means to further expansion, in what might be considered typical Rocket Internet fashion.At the time, it was thoughtthat those acquisitions would be modest, as Helpling looked to mop up a number of muchsmaller competitors in European countries and beyond where it had yet to establish a presence or there was no clear leader. However, Hassle doesnt quite fit that bill, to say the least.The London-headquartered startup is backed by prominent VC fund Accel Partners, after itraised a $6 million Series A round last May.And, by someaccounts, Hassle isroughlyequal in size to Helpling. Although bothcompanies operate in France, Hassles biggestmarket is the U.K.whereHelpling is yet to launch. Thats likely a major driver behind this deal.Also, dont be distracted byHelplings expansion into200 cities, after first launchingin Berlin in March 2014. AsHelpling co-founder Benedikt Franke told me in March, the majority of cleaning jobs booked happen in its top 20 cities, which doesnt currently include London, a major market for domestic cleaning and where Hassle is at its strongest.In fact, from what I understandthis is more a merger of sortsthe priceremains unconfirmed, though one source pegsit in the $25-40 million rangerather than a Helpling/Rocket Internetacquisition, creating a clear and formidable European leader in the on-demand cleaning market.(Update: Tech.eu is reporting that it was an all-stock deal, but that doesnt tally with my sources, cash certainly changed hands.)Whatever you might think about the German startup factory and e-commerce behemoth, Hassle joining forces with Helpling sets up an interesting battlewith Silicon Valley rivals.In the U.K. capital city they include the likes ofTaskRabbit, Homejoy, and Handy (via its acquisition of Mopp). And, to add a little more intrigue, Handy is also believed to be in talks to buy Homejoy, so we can probably expect more tidying up of the on-demand cleaning space soon.
