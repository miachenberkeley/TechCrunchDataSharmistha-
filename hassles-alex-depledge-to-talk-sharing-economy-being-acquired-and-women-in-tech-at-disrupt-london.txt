As co-founder and CEO of on-demand cleaning startup Hassle, Alex Depledge is not only one of the more successful founders in Londons current startup scene but is also one of the most outspoken. In particularly she is known for her strong views on the sharing economy, women in tech and the challenges faced when trying to build a global company from within Europe. Thats why we are super-excited to have Alex join us as a speaker at TechCrunch Disrupt London on December 7-8, 2015.Interviewed on stage by a member of TechCrunchs writing staff, shell no doubt talk about why shes such a strong proponent of the so-called sharing economy, the thinking behind Hassles recent merger with Helpling  a company founded by once arch rival Rocket Internet, no less  and her recent efforts to encourage more women into tech.We also plan to ask the self-described straight talking entrepreneur about her forthright views on VC funding and the U.K. startup scene as a whole, and many other topics, time allowing. This promises to be a must-see.Meanwhile, if that hasnt got you as excited as we are, TechCity Insider named Alex Entrepreneur of the Year for 2014. This followed her appearance on the U.K.s Scale-up Top 100  a list highlighting British entrepreneurs expected to lead their companies to 100m in revenue in three to five years.Shes also Chair of the U.K.s Coalition for a Digital Economy (Coadec), an organisation lobbying government on ways it can better support the startup scene and digital economy, and has advised the U.K. Department of Trade and Investment as part of the Afterburner scheme, helping to identify the countrys next 25 startups ready for growth investment.I, for one, cant wait.As for tickets to Disrupt London, there are less than three days left to save 400 off the full price of admission.
