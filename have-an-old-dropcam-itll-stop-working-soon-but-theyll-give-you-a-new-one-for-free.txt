Do you have an old Dropcam? One of those boxy-lookin ones from when they first launched the company back in 2009?Bad news: its about to stop working.Good news: Dropcam will give you a newer one for free to make up for it.On a support page published over the weekend, Dropcam notes that their oldest models  the Original Dropcam and Dropcam Echo  will stop working as of April 15th, 2015.Why? The company doesnt say much to that point, except that those cameras no longer provide an experience that meets [their] standards. In less nice words: the original Dropcam has a weak 320240 resolution and no audio recording, and they dont want to support it anymore.So you get a new Dropcam HD (pictured up top) for free. Launched in 2012, the HD isnt exactly Dropcams top-of-the-line model  thatd be the 2013 Dropcam Pro  but its considerably beefier than the 2009 Dropcam itll replace. Considering that Dropcam was charging $150 for the Dropcam HD up until a few days ago, its a pretty solid deal.For reference, the models theyre replacing:(Curiously, Dropcam.com isnt currently selling the Dropcam HD  just the Pro. A Dropcam rep tells us that the Dropcam HD is now sold out except for the inventory set aside for the replacement program; were looking into what that means for the HD moving forward.)Update: Dropcam tells me that theyll no longer be selling the Dropcam HD (the model theyre giving out for free, here) moving forward, though theyll continue to support it. Interested owners of the oldschool Dropcams can find replacement program details here.
