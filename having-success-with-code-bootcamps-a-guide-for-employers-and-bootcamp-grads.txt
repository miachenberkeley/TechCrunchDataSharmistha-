Anyone hiring engineers in tech knows how much competition there is for talent; there just arent enough good engineers to go around.As a result of the incredibly high demand for talent, the supply side has responded by launching coding bootcamps all over the country and, indeed, the world. Thousands of post-college adults are dropping their careers and spending months and many thousands of dollars in these bootcamps to become engineers.Ive heard quite a lot of skepticism about the coding bootcamps and, frankly, wouldnt have considered hiring tech talent from them myself if the folks over at Cogo Labs hadnt had success with it first.To date, weve hired eight employees from Launch Academy and General Assembly and have been very happy with what theyve been able to achieve since joining. In fact, theyve meaningfully accelerated our development timelines in more than a dozen key initiatives.Projects theyve built (with guidance) include:These successes havent been without cost. Weve invested a great deal of thought and work into designing a continuing education program with significant active mentorship to build on the (very basic) foundation from the bootcamps and help ensure each employees success from their first week on the job.The remainder of this post details our experience working with code bootcamp graduates. Well share the program we put together, along with the types of projects we have them work on, to help you make them successful. Other posts in this series will focus on hiring lessons for employers, as well as tips for bootcamp grads themselves on where to work and how to succeed once in the door.Weve seen some employers hire code bootcamp graduates and simply put them to work assembly line style on web app development. Theyll build basic Rails app after Rails app, or work on a small, constrained part of a larger Rails app where they cant do much damage, and are basically expected to work with the skills they bring to the job  which arent many. Many of these are small consultancies that basically build simple apps for small businesses; these jobs pay the bills, but offer very limited professional growth and very limited skill development. This is a terrible shame.Instead, we view our bootcamp graduate program as a farm system. Not all bootcampers will become full-on engineers, but by investing in them and  this is key  expecting more of them than basic web app development, we believe we can grow significant talent from within while having them accomplish increasingly complicated (and valuable) tasks over time.To understand how weve made bootcamp graduates productive, its important to understand how we view them.We see code bootcamp graduates as:There are so many smart, enthusiastic, coachable people graduating from code bootcamps these days that, if you can find a way to utilize them productively in your company, youll have a competitive advantage versus simply having to compete with Google, Facebook, Apple and others for the scarce resources that are computer science majors.Conversely, if you are graduating and can find a great mentorship situation, your new career will be off to a very strong start.The more people we can create who can effectively program and master technology, the better off the world will be in the long run.
