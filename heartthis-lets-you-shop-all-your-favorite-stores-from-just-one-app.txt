A new mobile application called HeartThis wants to make shopping across multiple retailers more convenient for smartphone users. The app, which is making its official debut later today on stage at StartXs Demo Day,putsover 330 stores in one place, allowing you to buyfrom places like Dillards, Nordstrom, Kohls, J Crew, Target, and many more, as well as see if there are any promo codes available that can help you save.The app has actually been live on the iOS App Store since November, but hasnt done much marketing or press, with the team instead focused on growing theuser base and working out the kinks ahead of Demo Day.However, though largely word-of-mouth referrals, the company claims, HeartThis hasgrown the user base to 250,000 active users as of December 2014.Whats also interesting about HeartThis is the kind of shopper theyve managed to attract. The serviceis winning with a slightly older mobile consumer  females 25 to 45 years old. Thats abit different from mobile shopping competitors like Wanelo and Wish, which often attract a younger, and even teenaged, audience.According to HeartThis co-founder and CEO Andrew Gadson, HeartThiss growth among females in this older age bracket has a lot to do with the appsdesign. The companyditched an earlier version that highlightedthe appsfriending and following model  a model common among todays social applications. Instead,HeartThisfocuses on building out an app thats personalized to each user individual interests.[Customers]basically told us I dont need strangers to tell me what I should be wearing. I already know who I amIve established my style. Just let me browse those more efficiently,' explains Gadson.Thats whats helped us grow with that older demographic  they dont need the social proof quite as much, he adds.When users first getstarted with HeartThis, they customize the content by selecting their favorite stores and categories of apparel (e.g. active wear, shoes, bags, accessories, swimwear, etc.). The app then returns a customized feed of items in a Pinterest-like layout where you heart things you like to add them to your wish list, or a collection. If you want to buy the item, you can do so with a tap of the Buy button in the app which directs you to the retailer.Unlike on Pinterest, HeartThis seems to do a decent job at making sure the items youre seeing are things that are actually for sale. Pinterest, meanwhile, is often filled with older pins that keep getting passed around, even though the product in question is no longermade, or is sold out.Another differentiator from some mobile shopping competitors is that HeartThis doesnt focus on extremely high-end fashion. Its really just an alternative way to shop from more mainstream-friendly stores, like those you would find at your local mall, for example, as well as some online retailers, including Net-A-Porter, Modcloth, Amazon and others.However, for regular shoppers, a favorite feature might be HeartThiss ability to track down promo codes on the items being viewed. If theres the potential to save more, you wont have to hunt around for the deal.The San Francisco-based startup was founded back in 2013 by Stanford grads by Gadson, previously of schoolFeed (a startup acquired by Classmates.coms parent company); Jennifer Gee, previously an exec producer at social gaming company RockYou; and Lance Tokuda, the CEO of schoolFeed,who also co-foundedRockYou.The service, which was live on the web in January of last year, has been steadily growing its user base 100% month-over-month since September 2014.While some of HeartThiss links help it to generate affiliate revenue for now, thats not the companys long-term plan. The team saysthat after it builds a larger community of users, there will be plenty of other opportunities to monetize, including running native ads.HeartThis has $2 million in funding, led by Freestlye Capital, with participation from 500 Startups, Founder Collective, Google Ventures, Social Starts, Tekton Ventures, Tom Moss, and Karl Jacob.The app is a free download on iTunes.
