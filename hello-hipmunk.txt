When travel startupHipmunk launched five years ago, its big selling point was abetter interface for searching and browsing flights.Now the company is looking to helpusers even before they start searching for travel options, through the launch of a new set of features called Hello Hipmunk.The company describes this as a travel planning assistant. Basically, Hello Hipmunk is an umbrella term for two products, one allowing users to interact with Hipmunk over email, another providing travel recommendations based onthe events in your calendar.On the email side, theres Hello Email. You send an email to hello@hipmunk.com with a question like What hotels are available in Austin, TX from Nov 20  Nov 23? and youll instantly get an email back with recommendations  if you see something you like, you can just follow the link from the email and book directly.I also tried out less precise queries, like asking for flights next weekend or hotels around Christmas and Hipmunk came back with more-or-less decent results. (In one case I asked for flights and instead receivedrecommendations for hotels, but I got an apologetic customer service email offering to help a couple of hourslater.) You can even cc Hipmunk on an existing email thread.If it works, Hello Hipmunk could eliminate the need for confusing or frustrating searches from your travel planning. It could also keep users coming back to Hipmunk before they even consider visiting another travel search site.By reading peoples emails and calendars (with permission, of course), Hello Hipmunk instead infers peoples travel requirements and provides recommendations on the best options (e.g. flights, trains, hotels, vacation rentals), making it so they never have to type anything into a search engine, said CEO Adam Goldstein via email.
