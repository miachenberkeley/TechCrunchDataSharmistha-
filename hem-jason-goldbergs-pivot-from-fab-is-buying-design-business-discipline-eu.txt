Hem, the Berlin-based home furnishingscompany that Jason Goldberg created last yearasa pivot out ofhis flashy-but-challengede-commerce portal Fab.com, is close to sewing up another acquisition. It isbuying Disclipline.eu, a startup based inItaly that produces andsells a small line of furniture and otherobjects designedbyindependentstudios.Sources close to the company say that the deal will close and be announced Tuesday of next week. Goldberg declined to provide a comment but has made no secret of his interest in Disciplines products.While Fab.com has shut down in Europe and elsewhere, it has continued its operations as a marketplace for third-party goods in the U.S. while looking for a buyer.Hem, meanwhile, is building a new brand around selling a pared-down selection of original goods aimed at the higher end of the market.This is where Disciplinefits in, with afocus on natural materials and slick and modern piecesfrom a small group of up and coming designers.Thislooks like thefourth acquisition that Goldberg has made to fill out his concept of a vertically integrated home furnishingsdesigner, maker and seller. Others include, in reverse chronological order, OneNordic (aka the luxury Ikea), and furniture retailersMassivKonzeptin Berlin and MyFab in France. It was through the Berlin acquisition that Hem (and Goldberg) set up the new HQ for Hem in the city.The logic behind the Discipline acquisition is to gradually scaleup Hems business with more inventory and infrastructure.By producing the objectsthat its selling, Hem cuts out the middle man in the retail chain and reduces the price in the process, while keeping a good margin for itself. By bringing more items, design and manufacturingtalent, and customersinto Hemsexisting operations, it will also improve the companys economies of scale.Over a period of a few years, storminginto the market with a vision of being the fashionable consumers answer to an eBay marketplace, Fab.comhad raised over $330 million in funding with an eventual valuation of around $1 billion.But, as Goldberg has explained, the struggleof keeping up with inventory and other logistics, maintaining a healthy margin, and simply keeping customersreturning for more or growing its overall userbase, all proved too challenging.With Fab at one pointburning through $14 million per month, layoffs and office closures ensued while Fab regrouped.In the process of pivoting, Goldberg has said that Hem is not only backed by the investors and fundingoriginally behindFab.com, but it is also keeping Fabs $1 billion valuation, too.
