Her, the queer dating app for women, has today announced that it will be available nationwide.Her is a dating app that puts a strong focus on content, specifically curated for and dedicated to queer women, whether theyre bi-curious or as gay as a rainbow.Her was previously available in seven cities across the country, only activating those cities after a certain threshold of requests were reached per city. But founder Robyn Exton says that the app has seen triple the requests in the past two months than it was seeing before, with at least 5,000 requests in most cities across the country.Given that demand, the company decided to cut it out with the request form and simply open the app across the whole of the United States.One of the bigger challenges for dating apps is density of users. If a new potential user signs up and finds themselves in an empty room, its almost certain that that user will hit the road and head for a different platform. To combat this, many apps use a similar request functionality to make sure there will be enough potential dating candidates available in a given market.With the uptick in demand, YC-backed Her has gone live everywhere.The app originally launched as Dattch, and offered a Pinterest-like feed of women in your local area. Users could update their profiles to include as many photos and text updates as they wanted, as opposed to a limit on pictures or bio length. Back then, the app had a content section with upcoming lesbian events and articles, but with the re-branding to Her, the app has put a much greater focus on the content feed.Exton believes this is part of what has increased demand for the app.All of the content on the feed is sharable, so girls who dont have the app yet are still seeing articles and event postings, and ultimately heading to download the app, said Exton.Her was accepted into the current class of Y Combinator after receiving $1 million in funding from investors like Alexis Ohanian, Garry Tan and Michael Birch.Alongside nationwide availability in the United States, Her is also available in the UK and Ireland, and has plans to go live in other countries in the next few months.
