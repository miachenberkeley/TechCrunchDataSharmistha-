Its that time again! Today was Demo Day 1 (of 2) for Y Combinators Winter 2015 class  when investors and reporters get their first in-person look at many of the startups that YC has been incubating for the past few months.Want to see what debuted? Well have a list of our favorites soon  but if you want something more exhaustive, weve got the whole list below.Startups are listed in order of presentation, along with our attempts to describe the company in just a few words. Weve also linked to our existing coverage for each company, where applicable.A few companies presenting at the end of the day were noted as off the record, primarily because they arent prepared for public exposure yet. As detailing these companies prior to launch would hurt them, weve honored this request.Tomorrow brings another huge round of presentations, so be sure to check back for that batch.
