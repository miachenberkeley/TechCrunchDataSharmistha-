Today at 1.30pm Members of the European Parliament vote on legislation which  according to independent observers and over 50 of the tech industries biggest players  could threaten net neutrality if key amendments are not pushed forward and added to the new laws. Parliament will hear debate 8:30am-10am CET, then break and vote at 1:30pm CET.The proposal before the Parliament contains four major problems that undermine network neutrality and threaten to undermine the EU technology industry by giving ISPs enormous new powers: Fast Lanes for content chosen by ISPs; Zero-rating content determined solely by ISPs; Class-Based Discrimination determined solely by ISPs; and Impending Congestion Management, once again, determined solely by ISPs.Stanford Law Professor Barbara van Schewick, also Director of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, has collated signatures from almost 50 tech giants, startups and investors for an open letter which will be sent to EU legislators today.Signatories include major investors Union Square Ventures, Felix Capital, Etsy, EyeEm, Foursquare, Kickstarter, Meetup, Netflix, Sunstone Capital, Earlybird Ventures, SoundCloud, Vimeo and Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web and Larry Lessig.Additionally a group of campaigners called savetheinternet.eu is targeting both the EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and Gnther H. Oettinger, the EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, (@EP_President and @GOettingerEU), asking startups and investors to contact an EU representative directly warning them about the dangers of the legislation.Some members of the EU Parliament have proposed key amendments that could address the problems outlined above. But thats only if the amendments are included.But you can help these keys MEPs decide on whether to back the amendments.In the EU parliament some MEPs, especially the Social Democrats and the European Peoples Party have been ignoring startups and a broad coalition of stakeholders to adopt law they know is flawed.You can help them to decide to back startups and innovation in Europe by Tweeting them here:https://twitter.com/giannipittellahttps://twitter.com/victorbostinaruhttps://twitter.com/tfajon
