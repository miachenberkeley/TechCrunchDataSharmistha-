Were thrilled to announce the companies that will be participating in the Startup Alley at Disrupt SF 2015, and you can catch a glimpse of all of them at our Startup Alley hub. In addition to being generally awesome, the site is also mobile friendly so you can easily view info on all of your favorite Alley companies right from your mobile device at the conference.The hub is separated into days and categories, so you can see all of the social companies that will be on display on day 1 of the conference, for example, making it super easy to keep track of the companies youre interested in talking to on the show floor. Each company on the hub has a profile that contains information about the company and their product or service, as well as any investors in the company thus far and how much money theyve raised to date. The profile also contains contact information for the company founders and representatives so you can easily have all the information you need to get in touch at your fingertips.And if youre so inclined you can share interesting company profiles with your followers on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or LinkedIn with the share buttons on the left side of each company profile. We wanted to make it super easy for all the investors at Disrupt to learn more about the companies that will be on display in the alley, and we think the Startup Alley hub is a pivotal resource for you as you plan your days at the show. Plus, according to CrunchBase, the companies that demoed in Startup Alley at our Disrupt events last year raised over $120 million after exhibiting at our conferences so we know youll be impressed.Speaking of the show, Disrupt SF runs from September 21-23 at San Franciscos beautiful Pier 70, and we cant wait to see all of you VCs, entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts at the show.
