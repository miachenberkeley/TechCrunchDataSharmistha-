The first HomeKit accessories launched earlier this month, just ahead of Apples WWDC event (at which Apple also announced new HomeKit features coming in iOS 9). Now, additions to Apples HomeKit support page tell users how to use Siri, the voice-powered assistant included on iOS devices, to control their HomeKit devices, including thermostats, smart outlets, lights and more.Listed Siri commands include things like adjusting brightness of connected lighting systems, modifying the current temperature, turning on named devices (which could be connected devices themselves or standard appliances connected to smart outlets) and managing entire rooms, scenes and device combos. HomeKit allows you to group a variety of connected devices across manufacturers and types under a single scene, zone, or room grouping, and you can control these all at once with the voice assistant.One noteworthy tidbit included in the updated support document that you might not previously have been aware of: Siri HomeKit commands only work on an unlocked device, so you cant use it directly from the lock screen the way you can certain other HomeKit commands.Heres the full text of the new section from Apples support website, but head over to the article itself if you want the whole skinny on HomeKit setup and use:After you pair your HomeKit-enabled accessory and iOS device, you canuse Siri commandsto turn it on or off, or adjust it (depending on what the accessory does).Here are some examples:If youset up homes, zones, rooms, or scenes, you can use also commands like this:Siri commands for some accessories wont work while your iOS device is locked.For example, youll need to unlock your device before you can use Siri to unlock your door.
