The first generation of Google Glass may have fizzled out, but the idea of a headset that connects you to the online world is still kind of sexy (and maybe a little unsettling), as shownby this new clip from the upcoming film Creative Control.Amazon Studios and Magnolia Pictures, which are releasing Creative Control in select theatersthis Friday, March 11, provided us with a clip showing how the main character David (played by Dickinson) uses theglasses.Its all rather mundane  but I suspect that if augmented reality takes off, thats how it will actually fit into our lives. The clipalso gives youa taste ofwhat Im assuming is therelatively low-key way the film incorporates technology and special effects.Amazon acquired the rights to stream Creative Control,though theres no date set for that yet. And if yourehopeful/fearful about more Google Glass, well, apparently thats in the works.
