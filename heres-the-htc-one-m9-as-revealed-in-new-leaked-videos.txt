HTC is just a few days away from revealing its new HTC One M9, but the surprise has been spoiled by a trio of leaked videos. Originally shown off by frequent Android leaker account @Upleaks, the videos below show the M9 in detail, including its design, as well as software features contained in the next version of HTCs Sense UI.The first video reveals a thorough overview of the M9, curiously presented in profile view. The phone looks a lot like its predecessor, but has a two-tone metal body. Theres a personalization option that lets you use a source image for theme, and a contextual home screen widget that changes apps based on your location. A new front camera uses UltraPixel tech for optimal low-light shooting, and a rear-facing 20 megapixel delivers more detail and resolution.The second video shows off a better look at how the HTC One M9s software features might fit into a users actual day, including a photo capture and theming example with a picture from a store window. HTC clearly wants to highlight personalization options, as well as the new meal recommendations built into BlinkFeed.Finally, a more in-depth look at the camera reveals some of the improved capture abilities, in a variety of lighting conditions, as well as new effects and options build into the camera app for after-capture processing and edits. The videos above might get taken down, but we have a gallery of captures from each that should provide a look everything regardless of whether the YouTube clips stay active.
