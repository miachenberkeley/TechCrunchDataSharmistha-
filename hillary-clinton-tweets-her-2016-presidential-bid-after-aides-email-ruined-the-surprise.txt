Its official  Hillary Clinton is running for president. Clinton announced her bid for the 2016 U.S. presidential race on Twitter this afternoon, ending years of conjectureover what many assumed was a sure thing.The tweet was sent after an email from Clinton aide John Podesta went out to supporters of Clinton from the 2008 campaign, spoiling what political reporters had been expecting since Thursday:This isnt the first time Clintons been tripped up by email. Early last month, it came out that she had used a personal email server during her time at the State Department, rather than using a government account. While the wave of hot takes during that news cycle made it seem like it could become a real controversy for her then-theoretical presidential bid, the issue has left headlines of late.In addition to her tweet, Clintons team has already launched the official campaign site, which includes a bio page that gives us a look at the experience Clinton will emphasize as the election cycle ramps up.One piece of, shall we say, constructive criticism thats come out of todays announcement: people do not seem to be into the campaigns logo:Hillary's campaign logo looks like a shipping company's #myhottake pic.twitter.com/d2ZoiKqZQZ Mark Di Stefano (@MarkDiStef) April 12, 2015Hillary's logo has a big red arrow pointing towards the right, at the candidate's name:  Weird design choice.

Minutes after the email to past supporters went out, an anti-Hillary hashtag took Twitter by storm:15 minutes into Clinton campaign launch  only U.S. Twitter trend higher than "Hillary Clinton" is "#WhyImNotVotingForHillary" Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) April 12, 2015
