If youre looking for exercises and workoutroutines, there are plenty of apps that can help (in fact, Fitbit just acquired one of them). But what about making sure that youre exercisingproperly? How do you know youre not working the wrong part of the body, favoring one side over the other, or doing anything else that might lead to an ineffective workout or even injury?Thats whatAthos is tacklingwith its smart apparel. The built-in sensors can track muscle effort and activity, then send that data to the smartphone app, giving you real-time information (or a post-workout replay) about how youre doing.While we were in Austin for South by Southwest, Ryan Lawler and I agreed to try out Athos during a workout with personal trainer Maurice Harris, a.k.a. Coach Mo.

In the meantime, you can preorder the Athos core device for $199 here.
