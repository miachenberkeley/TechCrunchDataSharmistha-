Homebase, a San Francisco-based startup,is launching out of beta to take the pain out ofscheduling and payroll management for small business restaurants and retailers.90 percent of retail and restaurant scheduling is currently done on paper or Excel, which makesmanaging payrollan owners nightmare. It takes an average of seven hours per week to review timesheets and coordinate schedules, all while takinginto account labor lawcompliance, overtime rates, and keeping within youroperating budget.For the33 million people employed hourly by these local businesses, getting a shift covered often means consulting a call list, sending out a bunch of texts, and hoping youll hear back in time.JohnWaldmann, founder of Homebase,shows me a photo of a schedule taken from a restaurant on University Ave in Palo Alto.Were in the epicenter of tech, and this is how local businesses are being run, Waldmann says. It seemscrazy to me  30 percent of the workforce doesnt have any technology helping them with scheduling and getting paid.Homebase helps to reduce the administrative burden of hourly work by automating scheduling, timesheets, and communication between employees. The basic tools are free, with tiered pricing options for additionalfeatures.During a six month beta, Homebase tracked over 3 million shifts and $100 million in earnings for thousands of businesses across all 50 states. Businesses on the platform reported four to five hours per week of average time saved.It became a pretty big beta, says Waldmann. The joke is that weve been running the biggest beta of all time, because there are thousands of businesses using it now, but we really wanted to do that because this stuff is complex.Homebase will focus initially on the 2.5 million small business restaurants and retailers in the U.S., but there is a much larger market to tap  over a third of all American workers are hourly employees.Considering that Slack has built a $2.8 billion dollar company around communication tools for corporate teams,creatingsimilar tools for local businesses could be an equally largeopportunity.
