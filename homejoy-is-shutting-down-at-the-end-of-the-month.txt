On-demand house cleaning service Homejoy is shutting down, after talks of an acquisition by its biggest competitor and a failure to raise enough money to keep things moving.Confirmation of the shutdown comes on Homejoys own blog, where co-founder Adora Cheung writes that the service will officially close its doors on July 31st.Homejoy had raised nearly $40 million in funding to date, but had difficulties raising sufficient funds for a Series C. In an interview with Re/code, Cheung suggests that lawsuits over whether Homejoy cleaners were employees, as well as the bad timing of the California Labor Commissions ruling on a similar issue for Uber, was making investors wary of the overall space  a point Im sure Homejoys surviving competitors would want to debate.Homejoy immediately stopped accepting new appointments, offering refunds to those with credits remaining.If youve found a cleaning professional on Homejoy that you particularly love, dont panic too hard that theyll disappear with the service: Homejoy says they are working on a way for you to contact them directly.
