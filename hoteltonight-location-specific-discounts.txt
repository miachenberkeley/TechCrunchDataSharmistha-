HotelTonights bigselling pointis the idea that you can get last-minute hotel rooms at reasonable prices,but now hotels can offer even bigger discounts for customers in certain locations.Specifically, HotelTonight is rolling out two new types of rate options. Theres the Rate Drop, where prices can drop starting at 3 p.m. for same-day reservations. And theres the Bonus Rate, which are special offers that can become available up to seven days in advance.The company says this could lead to prices that are up to 40 percent lower than other travel sites. Besides the individual savings, CEO Sam Shank said the new optionsare noteworthy for giving hotels more precision in how they price their rooms and who they offer those prices to.Basically, this is the first time HotelTonight is offering location-specific pricing. In the case of a Rate Drop, since its a same-day booking, it probably doesnt make much sense to offer itto users who arent in the same city. Conversely, a Los Angeleshotel (for instance) might want to use a Bonus Rate to tempt users in the Bay Area to take a weekend getaway, and therefore only present it in other California cities like San Francisco. (To be clear, in order to see the deal, youd still have to show interest in visiting Los Angeles by searching for L.A. hotels in the app.)Its the best thing weve ever done from a hotel perspective  they really are digging in, Shank said.And remember, until last fall, HotelTonight focused exclusively on same-day booking, so the Bonus Rate, at least, is taking advantage of the apps newish seven-day reservation system. The company says that system continues to grow quickly, with 55 percent more advance bookings in December than in November.
