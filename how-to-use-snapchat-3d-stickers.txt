Today Snapchat revealed its new 3D stickers that can be pinned toobjects in a video and stick with them no matter how they or yourcamera move. Add an emoji face to your pet as it walks around, orgive the moon sunglasses that grow with it as you zoom in.By bringing augmented reality to the masses, 3D stickers could unlocknew creativity. Theyre rolling out today on Android and coming soonto iOS. To use them, just record a video, tap the sticker button at the top of the screen, place your sticker over the object you want to stick it to, and long-press on the sticker.So how did Snapchat develop this cool new feature? The company refusedto tell me more than that they were developed in-house by its team.But after some research, I learned that Snapchat recently poached Eitan Pilipski, the VPof engineering from ofVuforia, an augmented reality technologythat hasthe power to connect experiences to specific things in the environment. Thats exactly what 3D stickers do. You can see Vuforias technology sticking Viewmaster points onto the landscape in this video.By using machine vision to recognize distinct objects in a video, Snapchat can track them as they move and keep the stickers in sync. Ive asked if Snapchat might launch 3D drawing next, but the company wouldnt share its plans. But you can imagine how that might allow you to effectively create your own animated lenses by drawing on your face and having the doodles move with you.Throughits animated lens and now 3D stickers, Snapchat is pushing the limits of what can be done with a video app. While Facebook is still trying to catch up by acquiring animated lens maker MSQRD, Snapchat is already on to the next innovation that could attract teen users looking to give their social media some flare.
