Editors note: Ken Miller is the COO of Gem. Previously he was VP of risk management at PayPal executive and adviser to Square.In the late 90s, as personal computers and the Internet were increasingly finding their way into American homes, there were those who either didnt recognize the disruptive power or potential theywould have, or they felt threatened by their emergence (e.g Ill never quit reading the newspaper!).We saw this again in the early 2000s, as companies like PayPal emerged and forever changed our willingnesstopay people over the Internet  including paying complete strangers.As PayPal quickly became ubiquitous and was changing the payments industry and commerce, most of the big banks and credit card associations stood pat and instead chosetofire off public lasers at PayPal, citing security, protections and regulatory hurdles as reasons PayPal would falter and was a risky proposition.Unfortunately for them, what they should have been doing during that time was innovating and improving customers lives; doing so could have very likely eliminated the need for a PayPaltoeven exist.Today were seeing this story again. Same movie, same suit-and-tie wardrobe, same dialogue, and what appearsto be a fast tracktothe same ending. Western Union, which discontinued the use of telegrams in 2006, has fired several shots in recent weeks aimed squarely at bitcoin specifically and digital currency generally.It started with itsCIO saying that bitcoin wasnt trustworthy and was a solution looking for a problemtosolve, and was soon followed by the filing of legal claims around copyright infringement after a spoof ad went viral on Facebook poking fun at the cost of remitting money through Western Union versus bitcoin.Most recently, details of Western Unions feedback on New Yorks proposed BitLicense regulation were revealed, wherein Western Union insisted bitcoin be regulated more, while in the same breath requesting could you please also leave us alone on some stuff?There are many problems for which bitcoin technology presents a solution, but one that quickly comestomind is the over $5 billion annually that Western Union takes from individuals tryingtosend remittance fundstofamily members in need both at home and in other parts of the world. Fees chargedtoremit funds tendtobe inconsistent and exploitive, ranging anywhere from 5-28 percent depending on the city/country pairing.Given the inherent near-zero cost of bitcoin, if itnever had any other application in the world other thantoeliminate these double-digit fees and get most of that $5 billion in the hands of people whose lives would be dramatically improved, then thats a problem worth eradicating with this solution.But when youre a publicly traded company, with flat growth and shareholder pressures, you often do and say things that are, at best, nave in terms of where the world is heading, and, at worst, conflict with the best interest of your organization and customers. A great example of this is Blockbuster in the 2000s, which frequently likedtosound the alarm on why video streaming was a niche business, and even spurned the opportunitytoacquire Netflix for $50 million.Today, Netflix has a market cap of $21 billion and Blockbuster has gone out of business, tryingtotake the Dish Networkto the bottom of the ocean with it. Blockbuster clearly overshot how much we would pine for the days of racing in the car at 11:56 p.m. in our pajamastoreach the drop-off bin and avoid late fees.But much like Blockbusters (and banks) short-sightedness and defensive posturing in the 2000s, Western Union runs the risk of soon evolving into nothing more than a Wikipedia entry. Bitcoin is a technology like video streaming, not a company like Netflix. Its nottryingtopreserve revenue or please shareholders. And it wont fall victimtoleadership pulling it into odd markets on a whim.Bitcoin is a technology that, other than Internet and mobile, could very well end up being the most important weve seen in the last several decades.The drum beating that bitcoin is not safe or trustworthy is, again, an incomplete picture and self-serving. Its analogoustoa horse and buggy manufacturer shouting about safety issues when the car first showed up. Yeahbut you could drive it really fast and crash it into a tree and die! Well sure.The reality is there is lots of innovative work stilltobe done around creating a completely secure bitcoin experience, but that work is progressing quickly and the world will soon be better for it. When Bank of America dropped tens of thousands of credit cards in the mailboxes of Fresno, Calif., residents in the late 50s, losses were initially extraordinarily high and executives gasped. But commerce and life as we knew it was forever changed.A couple of years back, Congress introduced legislation, branded as the Durbin Amendment, that was designedtocap the amount of interchange fees that a merchant could be charged by a banktoprocess debit card transactions. The intent wastotake some of the excess riches the banks were getting from debit card transactions and return ittothe wallets of merchants and hopefully even consumers (in the form of lower pricing).In practice, what happened is Walmart (which led the Senate lobbying on behalf of the Durbin changes) got massive reduced savings, small businesses missed out, and banks just made up for the lost revenue in other areas like increased checking account and ATM fees. Consumers and families lost out. In the meantime, the remittance market has gone completely unchecked, and thats been the case for years.The World Bank estimates that over $450 billion in remittance payments into developing countries will occur in 2015, which is three times larger than the amount of total direct foreign aid that will be sentto those countries. Unfortunately, $36 billion of those payments will never reach the individual or families they were intendedtohelp because of fees that are charged.The beauty of the advent of bitcoin is there is no needtohope that a centralized government authority tries to fix the issue with a faux solution that just shifts dollars around among giant corporations. Bitcoins low-cost structure and potential integration capability with all mobile devices eliminates the costs requiredtosupport the 80-year-old messenger with a cute hat, and renders the $36 billion in fees totally unnecessary  $36 billion that will do really well in the world.As this payment revolution becomes the standard and truly improves peoples lives by returning their money backtothem, there will be a real testtosee whatentrenched players learn from their historical brethren abouthow not onlytostay relevant but survive. History has shown that waitingtosee what happens or playing defensively will not change the world.
