You know its not just any old Chromebook when Google and HP team up for the things product launch. And indeed, the HP Chromebook 13 looks to be a pretty compelling alternative to the MacBook upgrade Apple ushered into the world last week.The laptop makes a compelling case both in terms of looks and muscle, sporting a 2.8-pound all-metal design, measuring half an inch thick and those sixth-gen Intel Core Mprocessors that have been the talk of the town of late.Thats backed by 32GB of storage (keep in mind, this is a Chromebook were talking about here, so take the usual caveats into account), 4GB of RAM (configurable up to a wacky 16GB), and a battery promising upwards of11 hours of life on a charge.The titular 13.3 inch display is QHD+, which works out to a 3200 x 1800 resolution. As for the up front benefits over the recently unveiled Apple, there are ports aplenty (including not one, but two USB-Cs), audio courtesy of B&O and a 780p webcam.The system starts at $499. Its up for pre-order now and starts shipping out in May. Well have some hands-on impressions of the device for you,post-haste.
