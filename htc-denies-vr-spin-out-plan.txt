Virtual reality is becoming a major focus for struggling smartphone maker HTC, but not so major that it will spin out its VR business into a standalone company.The firm today issued a statement denying a report from local media in its home country of Taiwan which claimedChairwoman Cher Wang is in the process ofcreating a new VR entity that iswholly owned by her and HTC. The report suggested that the idea of a spin-out was first raised last year, around the time that then-CEO Peter Chou stepped down to lead product development, but was abandoned for some reason and is now being revived.Not so, HTC said:Recent media reports in Taiwan, such as by United Evening News, statingthat Cher Wang is planning to spin off HTCs VR operations into anindependent entity that will be wholly owned by Wang is incorrect.HTC will continue to develop our VR business to further maximizevalue for shareholders.Speaking of shareholders. HTCs stockprice jumped at the initial reports, rising by over five percent to NT$76.60. If youve been following HTC  which was trading below its cash on hand last year, effectively making the company worthless  then youll know that moving its needle in a positive direction isno easy thing.HTC is pinned its comebackon a combinationof cost-cutting (15 percent layoffs) and more marketable devices, but the company said that the Internet of things, wearables and VR are also areas where it believes it can rebuild its popularity with consumers.The company forged important links last year asChou took a roleas executive director role with Hong Kong-based Digital Domain, in addition to his work with HTC and HTC invested $10 million in VR platform company WEVR.The initial fruit of the companys VR labor is the HTC Vive which, following much delay, will finally be available in April. The device impressed us last year, but how will it fare among the general public? Well see soon.
