HTCs much-anticipated VR headset, created in partnership with games firm Valve, just had its launch delayed toearlynext year, but that isnt stopping the Taiwanese firm from forging relationships with key playersin the virtual reality space.Just weeks after the company, which is seriously struggling in its core smartphone business, discloseda $10 million investment in VR platform WEVR, HTC co-founder (and former CEO) Peter Chou has takenan executive director role with Hong Kong-based Digital Domain, as Engadget first reported. The 22-year-old companyis notable for powering theeffects inIron Man 3, Transformers, Titantic and Her and Tron:Legacy, and has worked on major game releaseslikeAssassins Creed Unity, Destiny and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. In addition, itsIM360 joint venture has collaboratedwith Conan OBrien, Nike and other high-profile names and brands.Chairwoman Cher Wang replaced Chou as HTC CEO in March, with Chou taking on a new jobwithin the companysFuture Development Lab. Chou will retain that positionalongside his new role with Digital Domain, which said he will focus on strategy and technology development at the company. Theresobviously synergy between the two, and well have to see what that produces.Like the WEVR investment, Chous second role showsthat HTC is serious about forming ties with companies in the VR space to provide the content to power its Vive headset.Indeed, VR is one pillar that HTCis betting onas part of a new strategy to turn things around after its stock hit rock bottom and it was forced to make layoffs.
