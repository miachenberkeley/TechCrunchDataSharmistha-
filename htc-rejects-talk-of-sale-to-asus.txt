Perennially struggling smartphone maker HTC has poured cold water on suggestions that it is an acquisition target for fellow Taiwanese tech firm Asus.Asus chairman Jonney Shih made headlinesat the companys shareholder meeting on Friday when he did not refutea suggestion that his company might buyHTC. Asus subsequently clarified that there has been no formal bid put forward, but the rumorwasenough for HTC to come out with its own denial.We strongly deny the news. We didnt contact Asusteck and will not consider the acquisition. As an international brand, HTC will continue to design world-class innovative smart devices through its pursuit of brilliance brand promise, HTC said in a statement.HTCs business has struggled over the past couple of years, with revenue and profits tumbling despite the Taiwanese company producing some of the best Android devices on the market  includingthe HTC One in 2013 and HTC One M8 last year. This years M9 model is much like its predecessors and, since they hardly sold like touch screen hotcakes, many industry watchers dont see things turning around anytime soon for HTC.The company has, however, taken major steps this year. HTC announced in March that Chairwoman Cher Wang replaced Peter Chou,with Chou set to take up a product development role. Ithas also pushed into new product areas, with the launch of a virtual reality headset and a standalone camera. However, despite the quality of its devices, HTCs brandis being beaten by the likes of Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi and others.Beyond HTCs own struggle, a deal could be interesting for Asus because it has failed to break into the smartphone market in the West, despite seeing success with its PC and notebooks. HTCs business could  in theory  give it that option. Thats something to consider when you evaluate how Lenovo, the biggest brand in PCs, has shifted its business to mobile. The Chinese company sold moresmartphones than PCs in its last financial year for the first time.
