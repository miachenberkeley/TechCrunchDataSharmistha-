HTC cut the price of the Re camera to just $50 from $200, making it one of the least expensive action cameras on the market. Its a capable little camera with decent image quality. Yet its hard to recommend even at this low price since its ecosystem of mounts and accessories pales in comparison that of GoPro or Sony.This price cuts comes as HTC is weathering a financial storm. The company is in trouble and is clearly grasping at straws. Its unclear at this time if the Res price cut is a fire sale or an aggressive price cut to better compete in the crowded action camera market.Worth the money? You would be hard pressed to find a better camera for $50.
