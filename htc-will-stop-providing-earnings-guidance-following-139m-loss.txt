HTCs latest financial results are out, and the struggling Taiwanese company is still struggling afterposting a net loss ofNT$4.5 billion ($139 million) on revenue of NT$21.4 billion ($660 million) forQ3 2015.The company dropped back into the redin Q2, witha NT$5.1 billion netloss,following some very slimly profitable quarters. While the losses were somewhat reduced this past quarter, revenue was downseven percent quarter-on-quarter and more than 50 percent year-on-year.Off the back of thoseconsecutive losses,and a dismal year in general,HTC said it will no longer provide financial guidancefor its business going forward. Speaking on an analyst call,Chialin Chang  CFO and president of global sales  said the decision was basedon the dynamic nature of this business year and, he claimed, similar moves from other public companies in Taiwan. He added that HTC wants to avoid side effects.Refusing to givesales targets, which investors and analysts thrive on,isa desperate measure that signals desperate times.These latest losses wereinevitable given that the company announced a restructuring program right after those Q2 2015 results. That included laying off 15 percent of staff, streaming other business operationsandputting a focus on sexier devices  the first of which is theHTC One A9 launched this month.Itshas been a dreadful year for HTCChang said in the last quarter that the companys restructuring efforts wouldnt bear fruit until early 2016, and he reiterated that once again today. But with the HTC One A9 bearing more than a passing resemblance to the iPhone, the HTC-Under Armour wearabledelayed once again, and its promising VR product Vivestill to debut, you once again have to wonder whether HTC has what it takes to turn things around.
