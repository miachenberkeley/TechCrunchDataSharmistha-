The third largest smartphone maker by global marketshare, Chinas Huawei, has just unveiled two new flagship handsets  announcing the 5.2 inch P9 and 5.5 inch P9 Plus at an event in London today.The most notable feature of bothare dual lenses on the rear, sitting next tothe Leica brand.Huawei saysthe camera has been co-engineered with the veteran optics maker. Although that does not, apparently, mean the lenses themselves are Leica lenses.But of courseHuaweistill gets to use the Leica name in itsmarketing, and thats really the point here.#HuaweiP9 co-engineered with @Leica_Camera.

Theanalyst attributedthattoincreased brand visibility overseas. Huawei is evidentlyhoping to further ramp up its brand visibility by stickingthe nostalgicLeica nameon the rear of its phones.Whats the point of dual lenses? Are we seeing a return of the ill-fated attempt of a few years backwhen smartphone makers tried tofoist 3D photography onto disinterested consumers? No, its not so out-and-out gimmicky as that, with the dual-lenses rather being put to work to  Huawei claims  enhance photography viaimproved color/clarity, and to support features such as refocusing after the fact (as Lytropreviously tried with dedicated camera hardware; but as ever if it can become a feature on a smartphone it will ).The P9 and P9 Plus have oneRGB and one monochrome lens to support the various photo enhancements being touted. Each lens has a12 megapixel sensors. And the claim by Huawei is that the combination of twin yetdifferent lenses allows the devices to capture more light and thus deliver better looking photos. The proof of such claims will of course be in the testing/reviewing. But the company says, for example, users will be able to create pictures with professional bokeh (aka the artfully blurred background effect characteristic of high endcameras).The Art of the Perfect Shot: professionally blurred backgrounds #HuaweiP9 #OO pic.twitter.com/mxR4hci0O4 Huawei Device (@HuaweiDevice) April 6, 2016It also says the twin lenses support a wide aperture mode that lets in more light  and more light typically means better photos.Squeezing better performance out of smartphone camerasis the obsession of every high end phonemaker worth its salt these days, since photos remain the social currency of the web  whether its sharing snaps on Snapchat,selfieson Instagram or pictures of your lunchvia WhatsApp. People want to talk to each other via messaging apps and for a lot of the time they do it with pictures, rather than words.Huawei is also appendingthe Leica brand tosome filter effects, with the devices offering, for example a Leica Film Mode that supports three photo processing styles  evidently designed to hark back to the film cameras of old.

Stay tuned for a full review when weve had a chance to put the P9s through their paces.Gartners Roberta Cozza told TechCrunch she expects dual lenses to land on other smartphone makers devices this year.Discussing Huaweis new flagships, she added: The device is solid and competitive at the premium end, the focus on design was good as it is an important improve my from that point of view from previous model. As Huaweigets more convincing with technology and design in the premium end I think they need now to step up and differentiate with more unique Huaweiexperiences which will also help brand, as Huaweiaims to penetrate more the high end they will need to become more trend setter.
