This morning at the Hulu Upfronts in New York, Hulu CEOMike Hopkins confirmed the recentreport from The Wall St. Journalwhich indicated that the company was developing a live television streaming service to complement its current on-demand offering. While Hopkins was light on details like pricing, content, channel selection, and product, he did say that the new service would arrive in 2017.The service will offer a combination of feeds from broadcast television and cable TV, the CEO said.This means our viewers will be able to enjoy live sports, news and events all in real-time without a traditional cable or satellite subscription, said Hopkins. Were going to fuse the best of linear television and on-demand in a deeply personalized experience optimized for the contemporary, always-connected television fan.The service will allow viewers to watch their favorite shows and cheer for their favorite teams, he also pointed out.Access to live sports content is something that competitors like Amazon and Netflix dont offer today, but other live TV streaming services like Sonys Vue or Dishs Sling TV do.The Wall St. Journals report had said thatchannels like ABC, ESPN, Disney, Fox, Fox News, FX and Foxs sports channels, would be included but said that NBCUniversal hadnt yet agreed to participate.However, a later report from Variety, notedthat talks between NBCUniversal and Hulu were in the early stages of active negotiations. If NBCUniversal agreed to join, it could bring a number of popular cable TV channels including Bravo, E!, MSNBC, CNBC, Oxygen, Syfy, and USA.Viewers of the live TV service willbe able to watch television much like they could with a pay TV subscription, but would also have access to some on-demand programming in order to catch up on favorite shows. Its unclear at this time if that on-demand library will mirror Hulus current catalog or if it will be a more limited selection.There was no official word yet on pricing, but the earlier WSJ report stated it would be in the ballpark of $40 per month.Hopkins said that more details would be announced this year, and there would be a lot of opportunities for advertisers to participate in the future.
