Hulus SVP of Advertising Sales, Peter Naylor, noted at this mornings presentations that 70 percent of viewing is on the big screen.Thats why the company has partnered with interactive advertising company BrightLine in order to bring what it calls first-to-market interactive ad units to the living room. The idea with these kinds of ads will be to allow consumers to click the ads and then visit another page or website, much as they could do on their desktop or mobile devices today.The units will work on connected TVs, meaning not only smart TVs, but alsosets that are connected to a streaming media player like Apple TV, Roku, PlayStation, or others.A brief demo of the ads were shown live on stage, showing what look like clickable webpages but on the big screen.The new ads will debut in the summer, says Hulu.In another move that highlights Hulusattempt to become the streaming service that best mirrors traditional television, the company also unveiled a new collaboration with Nielsen that will allow for digital ad measurement through Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings. This lets advertisers to capture over-the-top viewing in the living room for the first time, and will include any viewing that takes place on living room devices.Nielsen already runs a program to track show viewing onstreaming services, including Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon, but Hulus newsis focused oncampaign-level measurement in the living room, it clarified.Hulu will also work with market research firm Millward Brown for studies, papers and stats for marketers and advertisers related to living room and over-the-top viewing. Magna Global, whose clients include Arbys, Aveeno, BMW, Coca-Cola, Dunkin Donuts, IHOP and others, will be beta partners on that initiative.Looking to reassure advertisers, the company also noted that its service is not affected by ad blockers, and the vast majority of its subscribers still chose the $7.99 per month ad-supported plan, versus the more expensive commercial-free tier at $11.99 per month.It also offered details on its demographics, saying that its subscribers median age was 33 and 84 percent of subscribers were 18 through 49.As far as Hulus content, the company announced it was renewing its drama series The Path for a second season and bringing back The Mindy Project for season 5. It said there wouldbe a second election special from Triumph, the Insult Dog that will be exclusive to Hulu later this year.And like Netflix and Amazon, Hulu will also be making the move to the silver screen this year.However, instead of producing its own film, it has secured the exclusive U.S. streaming rights to Ron Howards documentary The Beatles: Eight Days A Week (working title), which will debut both in theaters and on Hulu this fall.
