Today, Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa released a statement saying that it is in exclusive negotiations with Telefonica to acquire mobile carrier O2 in the UK,offering to pay up to 10.25 billion ($15.3billion, 13.5 billion ). Hutchisons plan would be tomerge O2 with its existing UK businessThreeto create the UKs biggest carrier.Of that 10.25 billion,9.25 billion would bepaid at closing and a further 1 billion would come throughdeferred interest sharing payments after the cumulative cash flow of the combined businesses of Hutchison 3G UK Limited and O2 UK has reached an agreed threshold.Telefonica acquired O2 in 2005 for 18 billion, although at that time there were other assets in Ireland and Germany included that are not part of the deal now. BT reportedly made an offer to buy O2in November 2014 for about 6 billion. The exclusivity period lasts for several weeks, Telefonica says.This is the first time that Hutch has made a public statement about its intentions to buy the carrier, although there have been reports of the deal since last weekend, and O2 has been on the block since November 2014.Yesterday, reportsstarted to surface that noted a deal would be announced today. This is not exactly that, but the latest step in a bigger dance of consolidation in the UK market, with BT also in discussions to buy EE, a joint venture between T-Mobile and Orange.For its part, Telefonica wantsthe cash from a sale of O2 in the UK to invest more in emerging markets. Based in Spain, Telefonica has been steadily building up its business in South America and looking to grab more market share in countries like Brazil.[Update: Telefonica released its own statement about 2 hours after Hutchisons, in which it noted: This operation marks another step in Telefnicas transformation process, initiated by the Company to become a leading digital telco and accelerate sustainable long term growth while maintaining an attractive remuneration policy.Additionally, this announcement occurs at a decisive moment for Telefnica, following a period during which the company has been proactively managing its portfolio of assetstodays agreement shows that Telefnica continues to lead the European consolidation process and it will allow the company to strengthen its financial flexibility. Telefonicas other consolidation moves have included merging operations in Germany and making a move to buy GVT, another carrier in Brazil.]A merged O2 and Three would create thecountrys biggest carrier, as per figures published by the FT(which uses a smaller total number of UK subscribers than Ofcom, 76 million).Together they would have 41% of the market with 31 million subscribers; EE would have 32%; and Vodafone would have 26%.A deal between Telefonica and Hutchison would not only need to be agreed on by the companies respective shareholders, but also but by regulators. Ofcom in the UK will have to be convinced by the two carriers that an acquisition would not affect competition and specifically lower prices for consumers. And because both carriers are internationally owned, there will likely be a final decision made by the European Commissions Competition authority in Brussels.The FT, in its report last night predictinga deal would be announced today (not quite),conjectures that as with previousmerger deals in other European markets, its likely that if this deal is given the green light, it will also see the pair giving up some network, or network access, to much smaller competitors  MVNOs likeVirgin Mobile, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk that do not own any network of their own.Right now, Three is the very smallest and newest of the mobile carriers with 8 million subscribers out of a total of over 83 million mobile users in the UK  or just under 10%  but it is also the most disruptive, offering lower prices for voice and data services than any of its competitors. Its also growing the fastest, the company claims.As a network that only came into existencein the wake of 3G services in the country, it has no legacy users on 2G-only services, and says that about 3.1 million of its customers are now taking4G services  which it upgraded at no premium to existing tariffs.There may be other hurdles, too. With Vodafone  the UKs other major carrier  yet to enter the discussions in any public way, there may yet be more developments and changes before deals are decided.One thing that seems more certain is that the UK  currently with three large mobile carriers (EE, O2 and Vodafone) plusThree  is on its way tomore consolidation. This would be the second major step in that direction, after the merger of Orange and T-Mobile into EE in 2010.Of all the UK operators, O2 hasprobably the mostchaotic history in terms of its ownership.It started out in 1985 as Cellnet, as a 60/40joint venturebetween BT and Securicor, with BT buying out the latters stake in 1999 and rebranding it BT Cellnet. It then spun that division off three years later into its own independent company in 2002. Telefonica then acquired it in 2005 as part of its expansion into more European countries, subsequently puttingother operations in Germany and the Czech Republic into the O2 brand.But there have been many factors that have impactedthe value of carriers in the UK and would have led Telefonica to rethink its ownership, apart from its focus right now on Latin America.First of all, growth in the UK has slowed down considerably with mobile phone ownership at a saturation point. Then, European regulators have put a cap on how much carriers can charge for certain premium services like international roaming. Third, there is a lot of price competition for more basic services. Fourth, there is a looming threat of yet more pressure on prices if BT is successful in its bid to buy EE  which would give it a proper quad-play offering of voice, broadband, TV and mobile. (Nevermind that BTspun O2 off in the past to move away from that.)Still, O2 has a notable rolein the UK market. As the first carrier to have the iPhone when it first launched, and holding an initial exclusive on that similar to AT&T in the U.S., this gives the company a very large share of the UKs iPhone users today, speaking to higher revenues per user overall.Well update this story as it develops.
