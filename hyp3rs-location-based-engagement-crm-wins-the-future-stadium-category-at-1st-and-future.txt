The final of three categories in the competition today was The Future Stadium, focusing on technology that would advance the stadium experience of tomorrow.And the winner is HYP3R! HYP3R is a location-based engagement platform.Sports games and events are massive sources of social media updates  but more often than not, these updates go out without hashtags or other identifying marks. HYP3Rs dashboard helps the venue and sponsors identify these posts, allowing them to engage in unique ways (such as sending a Welcome to the arena! message the first time it identifies a visitor)Perhaps more interestingly, HYP3R provides a CRM for those it has identified as having posted from a venue  helping them to identify repeat visitors, and notable social media influencers.The judges in this category were Vice Chair of GE Beth Comstock, Benchmark Capital General Partner Bill Gurley, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam (standard disclosure: Verizon owns AOL which owns TechCrunch), and San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York.As for the competition, heres a quick rundown of this categorys other finalists:ReplyBuy:  Instant purchases via text. Sellers (such as stadiums) can text potential customers with something like We found two tickets to tonights game! Want them? Reply BUY TICKETS and the quantity you want, and customers can reply to complete the purchase. Paranoid Fan: Social mapping at events.
