Youve probably heard quite a bit about social networking/messaging app Peach. Some say its dumb, some say its great, and a lot say something in between. What do I feel about it? It feels fresh. Fresh in a way that Twitter, Path, WhatsApp and Messenger doesnt feel.Mind you, its on a massive hype-train right now so take it all with a grain of salt. But by all means, please do give it a try. No need to let cynicism stop you from giving it a shot. Speaking of which, it seems like a lot of people are doing just that:Peach is currently at #120 overall on Apples App Store in the US for free apps, and is #9 in social networking (along with some pretty good company.) Instead of thinking of the rise as a hype or bust moment, it signals to me that there are sets of folks out there willing to try new things. We havent hit peak consumer apps as of yet. So as much as Snapchat continues to catch fire and Messenger gets smarter, theres a need  or want  for something else.Ive been using Peach all weekend and the best I can tell is the key is to not add a ton of people to your graph, as the more intimate the communication is, the better. Theres also a sense of accomplishment you feel once you get a hang of its Magic Words, its command-line interface to share different pieces of content within the app. Itll be fun to see what other commands get added.Im also having fun with taking photos in a way that feels like an animation, video or Facebook Boomerang:Groundbreaking? No. New? Fresh? Yes. Once an app hits a category top 10 theres an organic thing that happens where those who dont read tech Twitter or tech press gets a hold of it.
