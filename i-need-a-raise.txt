TheLadders is simultaneously announcing a new boss and unveiling a new product, namely a database of company and salary information.Lets start with the boss. Co-founder Marc Cenedella served as CEO of TheLadders from 2003 to 2012, when he left to focus on his new startup Knozen. Hes remained involved as chairman of the board of directors, and the company says he was reappointed as CEO earlier this year.A spokesperson for TheLadders told me that Alex Douzet, who co-founded the company with Cenedella and served as CEO after his departure, is now focused on some new outside pursuits, independent of the brand.When I wrote about TheLadders in November, Doucet told me the company was building new products (starting with a job referral app and job market guide) that should make the service useful even when youre not looking for a job. TheLadders team will continue in this direction under Cenedellas lead.The just-launched Companies feature does expand TheLadders in this vein  though in this case, the feature would be pretty useful both when you are and arent looking for a job. It offers information about positions and salaries for what TheLadders says are more than 20,000 companies.For example, I could see how my salary compares to user-reported paychecks from my employer AOL, which owns TechCrunch (for now). Besides confirming that there are a lot of people who make more money than me, I can also sort salaries from lowest to highest, skim basic facts like the number of employees, and browse recent news stories and social media updates.Oh, and you dont need to register to see any of this information. (Glassdoor, in contrast, will show you a few sample data points upfront, but youve got to sign up if you want to see everything.)Oh, and if youre wondering what this means for Knozen, apparently Cenedella will be serving as CEO for both TheLadders and Knozen (which has also been adding new features). TheLadders spokesperson said, Hell be dividing his time to support the needs and best interests of both brands  which means different things for both companies.
