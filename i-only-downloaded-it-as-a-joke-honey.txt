New Yorkers sickof the uncertainties of the urban dating scene can now turn to a new app designedto reduce the complexities of dating to dollars and cents.Ohlala, a controversialon-demandescortdatingapp popular in Germany, is launching its services today in its first American market, New York City.It was no sooner than OhlalasCEO and co-founder PiaPoppenreiter had begun describing her app as one thatconnects people to go on instant, paid dates, that she began listing a cavalcade of caveats.But what happens on the date is actually a private matter, Poppenreiter said. And you have to wait to use the app until youre 21.Of course we both knew what we were talking about, but my going through the process of an interview filled with raised eyebrows and eye rolls is probablyfairly representative of the marketing that the Berlin-founded Ohlala will be undergoingas it begins sellingthe gospel of romance-by-the-hour in NYC.The app, whichlaunched in Germany this past August, has already facilitated over 25,000 paidconnections for hot-to-trot users. In addition to todaysNYC launch, the app is also adding three new cities (Stuttgart, Cologne and Dusseldorf) to its German market, which already includesBerlin, Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg.The company also announced a $1.7 million seed round raise today with investment from Max Finger, Ben Kubota and Markus Ertler.Maximilian, if youre reading this I acceptVenmo or Chase QuickPay.Beforecreating Ohlala, Poppenreiter had worked on building Peppr, an app that more explicitly sought to connect clients to sex workers providing erotic entertainment. Where the app struggled was in the logistics of facilitating these connections quickly. Clients sent requests directly to sex workers and the interface led to a significant number of canceled requests.Ohlala approaches the connection for paid dates in a manner that allows for more instant liaising. Once a male user puts in a request, which includes such subtle romanticisms as hoursneeded and desired price, the inquiry has just 21 minutes to be accepted by a female user in the area before it disappears into the erogenousether.If a request is accepted by a female user, the pair then have the opportunity to negotiate a bit on pricing and time before settling to meet offline.After hearing this explanation, I admit I somehow accidentally referred to Ohlala as an escort service at which point Poppenreiter reminded methat hercompanyhas never referred to itselfas suchand, moreover, that she would more accuratelyclassify it as a dating app with apayment mechanism built into it.Germany has what manywould call a booming sex work industry, where regulationsare more generallyaimed at protecting the sex workers well-being and safety.Though prostitution is technically legal throughout Germany, due tolocal prostitution-free zoning practices, sex workis only fully legal in about 2 percent of the country geographically speaking.New York is a bit different.State laws classify prostitution as a class B Misdemeanor and the actof patronizing a prostitute as a class A Misdemeanor, where fines would be a maximum of $1000 or less than a year in jail.All in all,Ohlaladoesnt quite sound like a dating service New Yorkers should use if theyre looking to find the loves of their lives, unless they have rather deep pockets that is. Poppenreiter told me that average pricing for the paid dates in Germany runs anywhere between100 to 200 euros per hour.The press release for todays announcement said that Ohlala can fit the needs of every user, whether theyre looking for company, friendship or just good conversation. At100 to 200 euros per hour, I might recommend that chattyindividuals watch their small talk.
