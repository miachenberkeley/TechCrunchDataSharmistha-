IBM announced its intent to buyTruven Health Analytics today for a whopping $2.6 billion. It is the fourth major purchase for Watson Health since the unitwas establishedin 2014.Watson Health was formed when IBMpurchased Phytel and Explorys in April, 2014.Both companies had the common denominator of being data-driven health companies. The unit added Merge Healthcare for another billion dollars lastAugust to give the company access to a huge storeof imaging data.With todays purchase, IBMgets access to Truvenscloud-based data repository, 2500employees and 8500 clients, includingU.S. federal and state government agencies, employers, health plans, hospitals, clinicians and life sciences companies.While Truven gives IBM a treasure trove of data onhundreds of types of cost, claims, quality and outcomes information,its not just about the data for datas sake, saysAnil Jain, VP of Watson Health whocame to the unit through the Explorys acquisition.Were getting the data and all the resources to make sense of it and help us scale and [provide] data driven-insights and knowledge-driven insights, Jain told TechCrunch.He added that the data requires human experts to make sense of it and the 2500 employees coming over in the deal include data scientists, researchers and a host of other experts whowill be added to Watson Health.Its one thing to buy all of these pieces, its another to put it together into a coherent unit. While Jain acknowledges that taking all of the data, people and various client bases from the previouspurchases and putting them together into a coherent platform of services will be challenging, he points out that IBM has a great deal of experience doing that with acquisitions.Think of the Watson Health Platform  the cloud, the core technology being available for solutions being built for our client base. In somecases, we will build those solutions, in other cases they will be built by ourpartners, he said.IBM partners includeApple, Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, and CVS Health.For people who worry about the privacy implications of IBM having access to all of this health information, Jain says they get this question often. First of all, they comply with HIPAA in terms of patient confidentiality, he said.They also use a system that doesnt identify the individual patient to give a big-picture view of a particular diagnosis or outcome. The idea is to give the provider as much information as possible without having to identify the information about the patient behind thedata.As Jain explains it, ifa complex patient has a particularset of symptoms, Watson can help bring together data about other patients with a similar look, pointing out the pattern and without identifyingthe specific patient associated with the data. If a doctor can look at the various procedures, outcomes and medical journal data he or she can understand the patients conditionin the context of all this information and come up with better diagnoses and treatments.There are right ways and wrong ways of sharing information for everyone in the stakeholder ecosystem to get the benefit. At the end of the day the consumer or patient is at center of what we are trying to achieve, he said.Its worth noting thatthe stakeholders include patients, doctors, insurance companies and researchers, all of whom have an interest.While the individual purchased companies that make up Watson Health will continue to operate in their various locations, the unit is in the process of buildinga new headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They expect it to open later this year.
