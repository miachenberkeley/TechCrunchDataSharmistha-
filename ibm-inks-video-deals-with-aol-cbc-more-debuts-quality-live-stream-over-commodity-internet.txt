IBM today unveiled some significant strides forward in its bid to be a major player in the world of online and cloud-based video services, three months after the company acquired live-streaming startup Ustream and formed a cloud video unit. AOL (which owns TechCrunch), the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Comic-Con and Mazda have all signed on for IBM to provide online video solutions.AndIBMs video unit is also launching two new services to expand its footprint in live-streaming: a productthat will let media companies producehigh-quality live-streams over ordinary broadband connections; and an enterprise CDN product that lets companies broadcast live-streamvideo within their firewalls without impacting other traffic.IBM is making the news announcements officially today at the National Association of Broadcasters confab underway in Vegas, an event that will mean a rush of video related-news coming out this week. (Indeed, Amazon got an early jump on this Sunday, confirming that it will launch a standalone video streaming service, outside of its Prime membership, to compete more squarely against Netflix.)The moves come on the same day that IBM is announcing its Q1earnings, and analysts expect the company to continue its long-term revenue decline, which has been a hallmark of the companys financials for the past 15 straight quarters. The issuewith IBM is that the older, legacyparts of its business continue to shrink not just at IBM but in the overall IT industry, and so this is one of the reasons why newer fieldslike cloud services, video (and its Cloud Video unit) are so essential to its turnaround plan.Braxton Jarratt, who leads the Cloud Video unit (he came to IBM via another video acquisition it made, of Clearleap, in December 2015), says that todays news is a markof how serious the company is about growing its video services as part of its bigger cloud strategy.But while the company has been an aggressive buyer of tech and talent to grow this business and the services that it offers both to enterprises and to media companies, there is a limit to what it will buy next. For example, he outrules IBM making any moves to buy content-delivery networks such asAkamai. However, it may start to compete against the more anyway.Were not in the CDNbusiness like Akamai, he said, but we have so much stored on IBMinfrastructure thata huge part of our content can be pulled for customers without the need for a CDN. Then, when needed, a customer can move between different CDNsbased on cost and capability, he added.The Comic-Con dealwill see IBM handle a number of services for Comic-Con HQ(a partnership between Comic-Con Intl and Lionsgate), include powering its subscription-based VOD platform, content management, billing and streaming video to multiple devices as well as live-streamed video.The CBC, meanwhile, will use IBMs services to power its ad-supported video services.And while AOL is now a part of Verizon and presumably using the latter companys CDNs and other services, it will be using transfer and automation software from Aspera,acquired by IBM in 2013, to power its media management platform.In contrast, IBM says its service also from Aspera  is an industry first: open video transport solution capable of high-quality, live streaming over commodity Internet WANs.IBM says the new service is built onFASPbulk data protocol to transport any live video source, includinglocal multicast, unicast UDP and TCPto ensure timely arrival of live video and data independent of network round-trip delay and packet loss. Less than five seconds of start-up delay is required for 50 Mbps video streams transported over 250 milliseconds round-trip latency and three percent packet loss, sufficient for 4K streaming between continents, IBM claims.With consumers now running to live-streamed mobile services like Facebook Live and Periscope, this feels like a real sign of the times. More of us are becoming broadcasters, and so broadcasters need to provide content quickly that can compete with this, or at least provide conduits to use that user-generated content more effectively, and this is one route to helping make that happen.
