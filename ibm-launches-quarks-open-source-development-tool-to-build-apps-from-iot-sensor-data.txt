IBM introduced a new open source development tooltoday called Quarks, which is supposed to helpmanufacturers and programmers developefficient applications based on Internet of Things (IoT)sensor data.Quarksis actually based on the IBM Streams product, a proprietaryenterprise tool for processinglarge amounts of live data, but itsbeen designed from the ground up to offer programmers and manufacturers an open source tool forbuildingapplications on top of connected devices. The idea is toprovide a way forthem to take advantage of livedata coming off the devices in a simple, efficient way.For example, youcould track the health of a diabetic usinga wearable device or the well-being of an employee working in a mine or on an oil rig wearinga helmet fitted with sensors.Each of these scenarios and many more like them involve monitoring data at the sensor level, then accessing and communicating that data in real time to people (or other devices) who might need information immediately. For instance, when asensor on aminers safetyhelmetsignals an unsafe condition, they need to know aboutit instantly. There cant be a lag while the devicecommunicates to a largerenterprise databaseand compares it with other data.While theseprograms could facilitate rapiddevice to device or device to human communication, it doesnt have to end there.They could also potentially communicate thisinformation to the enterprise for a broader comparison of information across similar devices over time.In a medical device scenario, researchers could see how a group of people react to a treatment regimen over time, or the patients doctor could receive data on a regular basis to track apatients overall health.Thiscould potentially even link to Watson Health, which could review the corpus of data on the medical condition being measured and offer feedback to the patient or doctor as appropriate about the proper course of treatment.For now, Quarks is justgetting started, but IBM hopesto build a community of involved companies and programmers.The companys goal is that over time this open source community will catch on and that this development toolbecomes astandard way of building application for this type of IoT scenario.Its worth noting that earlier this month, Cisco bought Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion, specifically because it was looking for an enterprise level Internet of Things solution in the cloud. This shows that IBM is clearly not alone among large technology companies in recognizing that finding ways to capture, store and process IoT data is going to be big business moving forward.IBM is releasingQuarks as part of a broader strategy to graba piece of that business. Time will tell whether this particular open source toolwill catch on or not, but its worth noting that IBM has submitted a proposal to the Apache Foundationfor Quarks to be an incubation project as a way of pushing that along.
