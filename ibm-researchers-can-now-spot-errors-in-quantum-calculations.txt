IBM researchers say theyve solved a big piece of the quantum computing puzzle with a new system for protecting against errors that can crop up among quantum bits, or qubits.The issue the team is addressing is similar to an error that can crop up among the bits storing data in traditional computing. Sometimes, a bit that ought to be a 0 turns up as a 1 (or vice-versa), resulting in inaccurate or broken data. To deal with this, an extra bit is added whose state indicates whether or not the other bits are all correct.Jerry Chow, Manager of Experimental Quantum Computing at IBM Research, told TechCrunch his team is looking for those same bit-flip errors, but also something a bit gnarlier thats unique to qubits. Given their quantum nature, qubits can be 0 or 1, but the phase of the relationship between 0 and 1 can change between negative and positive.In the system designed at IBM Research, there are two qubits thathold data, and another two checking for errors  their state depends on whether or not a qubit has flipped to the wrong value or phase, respectively.Chow says that this method can scale linearly with the number of qubits in a system, solarger lattices will need more of these measurement bits. But that number wont grow exponentially with the capabilityof the system.So why is handling errors so important for quantum computing? These errors emerge due to interference fromfactors likeheat, electromagnetic radiation and material defects, which are all unfortunately common. If the results from simulations of the interaction of molecules are to be trusted, those using the data need to know there arent random errors throughout.Next up from IBMs Experimental Quantum Computing team is a similar lattice with 8 qubits. Thirteen or 17 qubits is the next important milestone, Chow said, because its at that point theyll have the ability to start encoding logic into the qubits  which is when things start to get really interesting.
