Editors note:Eric Elia is managing director of Cainkade, a full-service product design and development studio.YouTube Kids was low-hanging fruit for Google. Based on both the number of reviews and the high rating in the App Store thus far, the app will be a hit. It scratches the parental screen-time itch  how to put a device into your kids hands without risk of it being overused or exposing the kids to the seedy side of YouTube.This joins well-done user interface facades like Amazons Kindle FreeTime and the character-centric Netflix kids menu on many devices. YouTube Kidsvisual and interaction design is solid. Borrowed ideas, like the access timer (thanks Amazon) are well-implemented. But there are limitations.On iOS, there are only so many controls that a developer can put into its app. For example, theres no way, in software, to prevent a child from pressing the home button and jumping into another app or game.This got us thinking about what wed like to see in an official Apple Kids implementation for iOS something that would not impact developers at all but would empower parents with tools to better help them manage how long kids use devices and how they can use those devices. As parents, we believe in the value that supervised access to technology can provide. We just want a little help with metering that time. Sometimes daddy just needs to finish getting dinner on the table.The Cainkadecreative team did a great job of synthesizing the concept and fleshing out an experience that fits elegantly into the overall style of iOS 8.The key features we considered were:Our design goals were to:Home screenIcons on the home screen shown below represent three different kids profiles  Len, Nicky and Sarah. Icons can be customized with an image or color. Parents can add apps by dragging any icon on top of the kids icon, which is actually folder that contains other apps.Kid home screenSarahs apps are accessible using normal conventions. The wallpaper of her home screen can be customized in Settings.App behaviorNo changes within app usage, Toca Hair Salon 2 (below) is pristine. But after a preset time limit has elapsed.Source: Toca Hair Salon 2Time limitsA friendly traffic light tells the child that the time is up. The messaging uses graphics as a signal for pre-readers, as opposed to a standard text-heavy dialog box. Default time limits are set globally.Extend the time limit?Quick access to extend usage by convenient button press. We placed both the time selection and the default pass code on the same screen for convenience. Its the parents responsibility to keep the code private if they choose.Home screen No. 2Wallpaper has been customized with this fellas cute mug. Lets say his sister likes one of these apps as well.Sharing appsiOS currently doesnt allow for aliases or shortcuts for an app to live in two different places. But in a profile-limited kid mode, there needs to be a way for multiple users to access the same app.This is a slightly hidden feature, but something that is kid-accessible. We went back and forth on whether this should be accessible in kids mode, or something that lived in Settings. We could be convinced otherwise, but felt it best to leverage standard drag-and-drop behavior and have all app management functions in the same place. By putting the sharing feature here it solved several problems at once.A parent or kid can hold down an icon, and it starts to wiggle, as app icons do. An additional press makes the icon draggable down to the bottom row to other profiles.Sharing optionsWhen you drag the icon into the bottom row, theres an option to move it entirely, or duplicate it.DuplicatesIf you try to copy an app to a profile that already has the app, theres a simple error message.SettingsA goal here was to utilize global Settings as much as possible, in the same way that Privacy or Notification behaviors can be managed centrally, and leveraged individually by developers. Note the three kids profiles toward the bottom of this screen.CustomizationThe main settings screen lets you edit the name, wallpaper and app icon, and default time limit for the child. If you choose a color or texture, the childs first initial is used on the wallpaper and icon.WallpaperChoose a picture for the childs home screen wallpaper.Or perhaps a color or texture.Colors can be customized for a texture using filter-style choices. We thought this was an area where we could have a little fun within the iOS 8 interface restrictions.The finished effect.Time limitsStandard time selection and sound alerts are included.This was a fun little palate cleanser of a little exercise for our team. Wed be delighted to see these ideas inspire our friends across the Bay in future versions of iOS.
