One of my favorite things to do is to watch and see what emojis become candidates for Unicode updates (dont judge). Sometimes theyre really great and sometimes theyre, well, obnoxious.Two years ago, the word selfie was added to the dictionary, which made my day really awful until I saw that twerk was also added. Then it turned into the worst day ever. Well, another one of those infinite facepalm days is upon us, because we might actually have to endure an emoji depicting a motherfucking selfie.Yes. You read that right.The act of taking a selfie is still the butt of jokes for days, so surely adding an emoji wont make things any worse. Will it?

The rest of the candidates are pretty normal (here are a few):See that? Theres even a facepalm emoji. Thats something I can get behind.Please, please oh emoji lords. Dont adopt the selfie emoji. If you do, it means that the word selfie, the act of taking a selfie, seeing selfie sticks, etc., will never ever go away.Microsoft had it right when it adopted this bad boy:What flip phone should I get?
