The folks at the Autonomous Systems Lab at the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule Zrich in Switzerland have created the ultimate robot combo. Need a quadruped? You got one. Need a quadcopter? You got one. Need them both to bounce around like jolly friends? You got that too!This robot duo is an example of how robots can work together as a team and remain tethered to each other virtually. By launching the quadcopter from the jolly little platform you get robotic system that can move itself into place and then use a flying robot to check things up on higher ground. Its also the cutest robotic video youll see today.via Spectrum
