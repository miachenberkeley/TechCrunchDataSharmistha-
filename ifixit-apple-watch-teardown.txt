Today isApple Watch D-Day for aspeedyfew early adopters, with Cupertino finally shipping the first batchof its debut wearable to buyers. That means its also the day that serial repairers/tenacious teardownersiFixit get to crack open Apples latest sealed box and peer inside so we dont have to.Their teardown of a 38mm Apple Watch Sport and a 42mm Apple Watch steel arecurrently in progress  you can follow the painfully detailed dissection here.One nugget of intel theyve managed to prise out of the back of the dinky wrist computer so far is that Apple is not making it easy to swap outthe S1 processor chip thatpowers the watch.That may sound pretty obviousbut there have been suggestionsApple couldoffer an upgrade program for the Watch offeringprocessor upgrades as a way forthe smartwatch to stand the test of time vs less smart (but more long-lived) luxury watches with which it competes for wrist real-estate.HoweveriFixits findings suggest thoserumors are wide of the mark(albeit, this finding relates specifically to the lowest priced Apple Watch Sport model).Getting to the Watchs S1 processor took iFixit 20 steps. And required some destructive procedure, as they term it aka ripping out soldering.Despite rumors (and hopes) of an upgradable product  the difficulty of removing the S1 alone casts serious doubt on the idea of simply swapping out the internals, they note.The Apple Watchs S1 chip is also encasedin what they describeas a solid block of plasticky resin  presumably to make curious teardowners like iFixit work harder for componentintel.In contrast to its silence on thesealed away S1, Apple has previously confirmed to TechCrunch that the Apple Watchs battery willbe replaceable.And iFixits teardown bears that out  showing its far simpler (and non-destructive) to get to the battery to replace it.After liftingand disconnecting the display to get to the guts, theyre able to flick the batteryout  by step 11 in their teardown  liberating it from what they say is onlylight adhesive securing it in place.TechCrunch understands thelifecycle of the Apple Watch battery is pegged at aroundthree years. But if theres no avenue for swapping out and upgrading the internals at the same time, usersmay well be pushed towards a wholesale device upgrade in order to getthe next-genprocessor.
