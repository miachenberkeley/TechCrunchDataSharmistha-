Another dev kit targeting developers and startups that wantto build devices for the Internet of Things has launched on Kickstarter  although its maker, Imagination Technologies, is no startup, but rather an establishedcompany which licenses IP to chipmakers and counts Apple (withan 8.4 per cent stake) among its investors.Why does Imagination need to go down the crowdfunding route? Its more about wanting to tap its target dev community during the product development phase, says Imaginations Alexandru Voica.Using Kickstarter allows us to directly communicate with the maker community, start-ups and individuals interested in new dev kits and get their opinion on how and what we can improve. Kickstarter has some really great automated tools for user feedback and were already seeing some great comments about what other sensors we should add and how we could reduce costs for example, he tells TechCrunch.Imagination is aiming to raise 20,000 via Kickstarterfor the project, and Voica says the funds will be used to accelerate development of the IoT kit and to finalize itsopen source software framework. As many as 20billion connected devices are projected to be in play by 2020 hence all the interest in infrastructure to helpdevelopers createall those smart objects.So what exactly is Imaginationmaking? Its a kit,called the Creator Ci40 for IoT, targeting developers wanting to buildInternet of Things devices. The kit will includebothhardware building blocks and open source software frameworks, network stacks and cloud connectivity for securely connecting and authenticating all the wirelessly linked devices.The core idea being, as with all these connected devicedev kits, to offer a simplified system for developers wanting to quickly prototype a wireless IoT system  i.e. without needing to figure out things like how to get boards talking to each other first.Imaginations IoTdev board can be used in conjunction with more than 200 sensor boards to prototype multipleIoT use cases, such as  for example  making a gizmo that monitors temperature or humidity in the home. It links out to these sensor boards via two battery-powered 6LoWPAN Clicker expansion boards and three Click companion boards.The Kickstarter campaignnotes:The Clicker boards are compact development boards based on the mikroBUS socket. When used together with the companion Click boards, they provide a quick way to prototype and build standalone gadgets that connect using low power wireless standards to the Creator Ci40 IoT hub.It will be a combination of people. The maker community and individuals who like to build innovative things (robots, drones, etc.), says Voica of the target market for the kit, pointing by way of example to hacker-friendly peripherals, as well as flagging its powerful hardware. (The board will have a 550 MHz dual-core, dual-threaded MIPS CPU.)He also reckons startups will be interested in the kit again as a way to simplify and accelerate development times, freeing them upto focus on their core area of expertise, whatever that is.For example, were running a trial right now in Portugal where a company is using the kit to monitor the temperature and humidity of the soil in several farms and adjust irrigation accordingly, he adds.Another target is OS developers working with the likes of Linux and Brillo  given the board runsa combination of open source operating systems and software stacks.The Kickstarter campaign page notes the Creator Ci40 will runa range of GNU/Linux distributions, including OpenWrt, Debian, and Buildroot as well as GooglesBrillo operating system; the stripped down version of Android Google is targeting at IoT devs.Imagination is certainly not the first to come up with anIoT dev kit aiming tohelp developers straddle the wirelessly linked worlds of software and hardware.Others already playing in this space include:relayr, with itsWunderbarIoT starter kit and cloud platform for sensor data (this European startupraised an $11 million Series A round, earlier this month);Spark Labswith its Spark Core IoT dev kit and SparkCloud platform;and  also straddling the dev/consumer maker space  SAM:a wireless electronics kit with a drag-and-drop software interface for generating code to automatically link the blocks.How does Imaginations Creator Ci40 differ from existing IoT kits? Voica flagsthe ecosystem system support for main Linux distributions and Googles Brillo OS as one differentiator.Creator is one of the few dev boards selected by Google to be part of its Brillo golden reference program  these boards will be the equivalent of Nexus phones when it comes to Brillo, receiving regular updates and patches ahead of others, he notes.He also says the prebuilt open source software framework is optimized for IoT, whereas not all other dev boards can say this;noting, for example, that the board includesthe802.15.4 wireless standard not just802.11 Wi-Fi or Bluetooth standards as he says some other boards do.Likewise, the hardware has been optimized for IoT too  rather than just reusing existing phone chips, as some others kits have, which he says can lead to increased power consumption (like weve seen in smart watches).Weve designed a chip that has been optimized for IoT, selecting an optimal feature set that will be useful for this market (e.g. hardware multithreading), he adds.Free access to FlowCloud,the cloud platform for storing sensor readings to the cloud, is anotherdifferentiatorhe flags up.Assuming the crowdfunding campaign goes to plan, Imagination is planning to ships kits to backers by April 2016. The Creator Ci40 board on its own is priced at 35/$50 to Kickstarter backers. A full kit which includes the dev board plus 2x Clicker expansion boards and 3x Click sensor boards costs 70/$100 to early backers.
