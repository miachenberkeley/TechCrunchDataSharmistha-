Andreessen Horowitzs team continues to grow and change.Today, the Sand Hill Road firm is announcing the appointment of its newest and ninth general partner: Martin Casado, the cofounder and CTO of Nicira and a pioneer of so-calledsoftware defined networking; Nicera was among the first companies to decouple software from networking hardware, allowing companies to see greater flexibility in managing their networking needs.The company was an early bet for Andreessen Horowitz and ranks among its biggest exits to date. Indeed, in 2012, VMWare stunned many in the industry when it agreed to buy the young company for $1.05 billion in cash and $210 million in equity awards. (Soon after it was announced, Business Insider published asolid behind-the-scenes piece about how Nicira, which had raised roughly $42 million from private investors, came to be valued so highly.)In a newly published post, firm cofounder Marc Andreessen recalls meeting Casado in 2009 when he was a newly minted Stanford Computer Science Ph.D., vigorously pitching us on a networking future where software would run the show.Adds Andreessen, whose firm became Niciras first institutional investor, He was clearly speaking our language. (Andreessens cofounder, Ben Horowitz, sat on Niciras board.)In a phone conversation yesterday, Casado  who joined VMWare as an SVP and general manager and has been leading the companys networking and security business  said hes eager to get to work on April 1.While he hasnt been an active investor until now, Casado has meaningful experience with startups, he notes. Among other things, last summer, he wrote a check alongside Andreessen Horowitz to the encrypted file sharing platform Keybase. Hes an advisor to several companies, including LightSpeedand CloudGenix. Casado has alsoserved on VMWares M&A committee, helping the company vet potential strategic investments.More, Casado willhave the guidance, at least at first, of fellow general partnerPeter Levine, a longtime operator who joinedAndreessen Horowitzin 2011 and is heavily focused on enterprise deals.Not that you should extrapolate too much from that, suggested Casado. One of the things I love about Andreessen Horowitz is that they dont pigeonhole GPs into [investing in a] certain state of funding or a certain sector. Indeed, afterfocusing so narrowly on networking, he said hes excited to broaden his focus to an array of shifts in software.Casados hire comes roughly a month after we reportedthat longtime GP Scott Weiss will no longer be part of the firms next fund.The appointment also follows the hiring of Vijay Pande, who was brought aboard in November to lead the firms charge into biotech investing.Asked if Andreessen Horowitzwill be announcing its next fund imminently(the various moves suggest as much),Levine, who we also spoke with yesterday, told us only, Well let you know.As for adding yet another man (the nearly seven-year-old firm has already seen other male partners come and go, including John OFarrell and Balaji Srinivasan), Levine said Andreessen Horowitzwould love to hire a woman.The firmhasmade offers to great people, he continued, but, so far, we haventbeen able to hire anybody. If you know anyone, he said, please send them our way.
