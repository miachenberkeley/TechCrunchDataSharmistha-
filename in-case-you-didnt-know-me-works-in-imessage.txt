Its Friday, and sometimes when we try to wind our week down something winds us back up. Today, it has to do with the app that a lot of us use the most on MacMessages.Guys, /me works in iMessage. WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME?! pic.twitter.com/GpwtK7gsxE  Chris Messina  (@chrismessina) October 23, 2015Yes. You can use /me in a conversation./me did not know that.But why no workie on iOS? :(Its something thats available on a few other messaging platforms, including Googles Hangouts, but the geek masses might not know that its available on Apples app.Why is this cool? I dont know. But Ive done /me on IRC and pretty much every chatting platform that I can remember, even in the BBS days. Plus, I didnt know it was possible. Its potentially leftover from the days of iChat./me hopes you have a wonderful weekend.
