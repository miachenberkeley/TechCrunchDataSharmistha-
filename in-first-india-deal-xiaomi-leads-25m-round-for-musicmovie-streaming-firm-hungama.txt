TheChinese smartphone firm todayannounced it hasled a $25 million round forHungama, a video and music streaming service that claims 65 million users, and that it will integrate the companys services into its content platform in India in the near future.Xiaomihas made a concerted effort to gain marketsharein Indias fast-growing smartphone market since it began selling therein 2014. It joined the governments Make In India programand took strategic investment from top businessman Ratan Tata, and has long said on record that it would invest in startupsthat complement its business in India.Xiaomi has been an Internet company from the verystart. We think of smartphones as a platform for us to deliver Internet services, and this includescontent, Xiaomi VPHugo Barra said in a statement. Weare investing in Hungama not only to start integrating content into our smartphones, but also togrow together with them and deepen our understanding of the content sector in India.While Xiaomi has played hard in India, it appears to have found the going tough, with plenty of competition in the sub-$500, sub-$300, and sub-$150 price brackets it playsin. It claimed a best-yet one million sales in Q3 2015, contrary to a more pessimistic outlookfrom some industry analysts, but, either way, India representedjust a small portionof its 70 million global sales last year  which, it should be noted, came in below Xiaomis own target.Existing Hungama investors also participated in the deal, includingIntel Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners and billionaire investor and trader Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.Intel Capital and Bessemer Venture Partnersprovided the companys last funding,a $40 million raise in 2014, while the former invested an undisclosed sum in 2012.One year ago we reported that Hungama, which started out as amarketing and communications agency before pivoting to entertainment in 2009, was raising a massive $100 million round to compete more even-handedly with well-funded, newer arrivals like Saavn and Gaana. Hungama CEO Neeraj Roy today confirmed to TechCrunch that the company had been intalks to raise that round, but he said the financingnever happened as Hungama picked a different route.Roy stressedHungama, which claims to have over 8,000 movies on its platform,has tangible revenues and is not burning cash like its rivals, he suggested. He further stressed that his company is focused on raising capital from the right people and on the right terms.We are very excited to be partnering withXiaomi, as we are extremely aligned in the way we see digital media becoming mainstream onmobile devices, Roy addedviaa statement. With thisinvestment, we intend to further strengthen our movie and TV services.
