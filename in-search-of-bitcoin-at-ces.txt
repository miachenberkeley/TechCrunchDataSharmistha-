Bitstamp, the well-known bitcoin exchange that saw the equivalent of $5 million in the cryptocurrency disappear after a breach by malicious hackers, was notablyabsent during last weeks CES show  its pre-paid stand completely empty save for a fan oftrade mags laid out by a hopeful publisher. Instead of manning their booth, reps fromcompany, we heard, wereholed up in a hotel room helping the startup resume services  which it did by last Friday.But thatpainful process, however, didnt seem to dent larger enthusiasm forbitcoin at the Vegas trade show. Even late on a Thursday afternoon, lots of people nosedaround the exhibitor stands, trying out demos of a bitcoin ATM, buying things with the currency, and hearing tips about how to mine the damn things.Damn is the operative word here: I heard of someonetapping tohydropower to mine the currency.Although Bitstamps 19,000 lost coins are nowhere near the magnitude of Mt Gox, thejuxtaposition of yet another hacking, alongside all the curiosity and positive interest in bitcoin, underscores how the currency and its placein the market remain in flux. Yes, itholds a lot of promise. But stability  and for many consumers, comprehension or relevance  remain elusive.I took a stroll around the bitcoin standsof CES and chatted with some of the bigger players in the space, including Circle (making bitcoin relevant to average consumers); Bitpay (the PayPal of bitcoin, working withbusinesses to enable bitcoin commerce); Robocoin (bitcoin ATMs) and Kraken (an exchange). Kraken is interesting in light of the Bitstamp hack: they have been assigned to help investigate what went wrong at Mt Gox, and help recover as much of the money as they can. No news on that front just yet: theyre only now getting started, they tell me.
