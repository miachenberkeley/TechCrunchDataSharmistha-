Finnish smartphone startupJolla has inked thefirstlicensing deal for its Android alternativeSailfish OS, some three years after starting out on a grand planto save the open-sourcemobile platformNokia was abandoning in favor of Microsofts Windows Phone.Today Jolla has announced that IndiasOEM,Intex, which itsays is the countrys second largest mobile maker (after Micromax), will be bringing SailfishOS based products to the market later in 2015.According to The Indian Express, Intex will be launching a 4G smartphone running Sailfish called the Intex Aqua Fish thisSeptember, priced at around Rs 15,000 ($240).Update:According to Jolla, the price-point for the forthcoming handsetwill be less than Rs 10,000 ($150).Last weekJollaannounced it is steppingawayfrom making handsets itself, as Jolla Ltd, to fully focus its efforts on developing itsSailfish software  andon that OS licensing business. Competing directly with your OS licensing customers didnt, after all, work out too well for Microsofts mobile handset and OS business.While Jolla Ltd is solely focused on software, the company is intending to create another business to carry on buildinghardware  with more details on that due by the end of the summer. If Jollaslicensing business takes off this separate company could end up acting as a hardware showcase to potential Sailfish licensees.Either way, Jolla Ltd has freed itself up to present a tighter pitch to partnersin its targetBRICS regions  thatpitch being for a more flexible mobile platformthan Googles dominant Android OS (but an OS that isnonetheless compatible with Android apps, helping to closethe app gap which continues to prove a gulf for other Android and iOS challengers).Jolla isofferingSailfish partners the chanceto deeply embed their services within the platform  in an area it callsPartnerSpace (example below, showing Times Internets music service gaana)  holding out the prospect of a more localized smartphoneexperience to woo regional buyers, and one where regional brands partnering with Jollaget thechance togenerate revenue thanks to theirpremium placement within the smartphone OS.Of course all this only works if BRICS buyers can be convinced to opt forSailfish handsets, rather than Android (or Android Open Source Project) handsets. Time will tell. Handset price and bundled local services may well lead here though, especially for first time buyers who arent already accustomed to a smartphone OS.Jolla reckons itsSailfish licensing push has the most early momentum inIndia. Today it formally announced Sailfish India: aka its regional mobile ecosystem initiative for the country, with the first partners named as the aforementionedIntex Technologies; along with digital media companyTimes Internet; and Indian ecommerce giant Snapdeal. (It has previously announceda Sailfish Africa initiative, but has yet to nameany partners there.)The aim for Sailfish India is to develop a unique Indian mobile ecosystem, which will leadto greater differentiation in the market with more choices for consumers, higher usersatisfaction and better revenues for local businesses. Further Sailfish India partners will beannounced later, Jolla said today.Commenting in a statement, Jollas executive chairman Antti Saarnio, said its BRICS strategy has been proceeding fastest in India, adding: We have seen a lot of interest among Indian device vendors, digitalmedia houses, and mobile operators, and they all are very keen to work with an alternativeto the currently dominating mobile operating systems. India deserves its own regionalmobile ecosystem, an open platform, which supports local Indian services andbusinesses.One factor playing intos Jollas hands here is the profit squeeze onAndroid OEMs. Competing in that handset space has never been tougher. Jollas offer of a revenue-share for sales generated via an OS that foregrounds local brands is the carrot for BRICS brands to take a punt on an Android alternative  and one that can still tap into a sub-set of Android apps.By integratingIndias largest online marketplace Snapdeal to a prominent location in the Sailfish OS userinterface, it will drive value for both Snapdeal and consumers by making online purchasesjust swipe away, is howJollas PR for the freshly inked Snapdeal ecommerce partnership spinsit.Commenting on itsinvolvement in a statement, Snapdeals Karan Khara, VP of strategic alliances, added: Mobile is driving the onlinecommerce growth in India; we see more than 75% of our sales coming through the mobileplatform. We are very excited to be a part of another first by Jolla and are confident thatthe Sailfish India ecosystem will receive a great response from users across the country.
