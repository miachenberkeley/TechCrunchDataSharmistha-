TaskBob is the latest home services startup in India to landa Series A round. The Mumbai-based company has closeda $4.5 million raise that was led byIvyCap Ventures with participation from existing investors Orios and Mayfield.With smartphone ownership rising rapidly in India, bringing more of the countrys billion-plus populationonline in turn, home services have emerged as a category where tech can lend a hand. What once was a wild west, has settled down somewhat with category leaders emerging.When we started out there were probably 150 players in home services space, [but] now the market has consolidated a lot and there are top players who have secured Series A and Series B financing, TaskBob CEOAseem Khare told TechCrunch in an interview.Founded last year, TaskBobhas bucked the trend of scaling fast in India by sticking to a single city  Mumbai  where it is testing its model. Thats in stark contrast to Housejoy, whichraised a $23 million Series A led by Amazon in Decemberand is currently in 11 cities, and Urbanclap, which fetched a $25 million Series B in November and operates a marketplace acrossfive cities.Housejoy is aiming to expand to 25 cities this year and Urbanclap has set its sights on growing to 30 cities, but Khare told TechCrunch that his company is focused on proving the economics of itsmodel in Mumbai, after which he believes it will expand to four or five new cities within the next eighteen months.TaskBobs deliberate focus on unit economics and sustainable reflects a different business model to its competitors. Khare likens it to a full stack approach, by which he means that TaskBobaspiresto tightly control the entire customer chain rather than outsource elements of it. For example, all merchants are trained on customer service basics and other elements of thecompanys service culture. That reflects a focus on quality which, Khare said, has thus far helped TaskBob hit a repeat booking rate of 70 percent and keep 90 percent of ratings between fourand five stars.To create a brand you need to retain consistent quality, Khare said of the focus on quality.So while Urbanclap operates amarketplace model  which gives it scale of20,000 service providers across 75 categories  and Housejoy goes beyond basic services  coveringtasks as diverse aselectrical/appliance repairs, beauty and fitness TaskBob is maintaining a firm focus on more standard services likecleaning, handymen anddrivers. Right now,Task Bob claims800 to 1,000 bookings per day and it plans to increase that daily figure to 10,000 over the coming 18 months.Khare said the company is already breaking even in multipleparts of Mumbai, and he foresees that converting to profitability across the entire city over the coming year and a half.
