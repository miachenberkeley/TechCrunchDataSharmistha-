One of the biggest challenges of a hardware crowdfunding campaign is delivering in a timely fashion.Indiegogo knows that better than most, and is teaming up withArrow Electronicsto help entrepreneurs deliver products through engineering assistance and go-to-market support.The move is continuing the crowdfunding platforms hard push to beat Kickstarter as the go-to platform for gadgets and electronic products, positioning itself as a full funding-to-production platform.Were very excited as Arrow strengthens our commitment to helping entrepreneurs turn their ideas into products as quickly as possible, said Indiegogo CEO David Mandelbrot. Weve seen an incredible amount of growth among tech and IoT projects on Indiegogo and we think thats because were developing new ways to help entrepreneurs with support beyond funding, and this Arrow collaboration is a great example of that.Canarys Indiegogo campaign became a tremendous success, and was delivered with Arrows help a while back.Before committing to help,Arrow will assess Indiegogo campaigns for their technical feasibility, manufacturability and is-this-a-good-idea-in-the-first-place-or-will-it-die-the-fiery-death-of-crushed-entrepreneur-dreams(okay, I may have made up that last part). Campaigns that are receiving the Arrow treatment receive a special Arrow badge signifying that the campaign has an army of Smart People behind it, which in theory should increase its chances of delivering successfully.Over the last year, Indiegogo has introduced new services meant to support entrepreneurs beyond the crowdfunding stage of their business, includingInDemand, which enables campaigns to continue accepting pre-orders after their crowdfunding efforts end, and Marketplace, which isIndiegogos leap into e-commerce, offering a service for business owners to sell products that are ready to ship.Solar Roadways was successful on Indiegogo and went on to deliver with Arrows help.Integrating with Arrow isa tremendously interesting move from Indiegogos side, butit remains to be seen whether its a good business decision; the introduction of the Arrow badge could potentially create a two-tier system, where campaigns with the badgefind it easier to get funding and campaigns not so adorned wither away, unloved and alone.Arrow and Indiegogo arent strangers to each other; the tremendously successful Solar Roadways and Canary Indiegogo campaigns both turned to Arrow for delivery help and both are well on their way to delivering on their $2 million-plus Indiegogo campaigns. The new initiative, Indiegogo says, merely formalizes the existing alliance between the two companies.It is unclear whether the Arrow deal is exclusive, but my hope is that this deal is thefirst step. Indiegogo could do a lot worse than establishing a supportmarketplace for high-quality businesses to help newly minted entrepreneurs make the most of their crowdfunding dollars in the pursuit of delivering their dream products to the eager public.
