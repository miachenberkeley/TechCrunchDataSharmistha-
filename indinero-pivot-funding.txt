Hey, remember inDinero? We covered the Y Combinator-incubated company a couple times back in 2010, when it was trying to build a Mint-style service for small businesses and raised $1.2 million in seed funding.Well, co-founder and CEO Jessica Mah told me that in the years since, the company nearly ran out of money, laid off all its employees, and switched to a new model. But it seems to have bounced back, and its accelerating those efforts with $7 million in new funding.Instead of a self-service tool for trackingsmall business finances, inDinero now offers what Mah calls an all-in-one solution for accounting, taxes and payroll. That means businesses dont need to piece together a bunch of different service providers and software products to get all their needs met  they can just go to inDinero, which offers its services on top of proprietary software.The model works better for inDinero, Mah said, because it means the company isnt trying to collect $20 monthly fees from Mom and Pops on sites like Etsy, but instead working with sophisticated, complex businesses and charging them thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands. (To be clear, Mah said inDinero can work with companies as small as one or two employees and as big as 100 employees.)And while inDineros technology does automate much of that process behind the scenes, Mah acknowledged that it has become a much more service-oriented business. She alternately referred to the model as accounting-plus-service and service-as-a-software (er, Im not sure thats going to catch on), and she suggested that inDinerosees the same kind of margins as a software-as-a-service business.In fact, she said the companyis pretty close to cash-flow positive, with periods of profitability last year.As for the funding, it comes from investors including Kevin Hartz, Bobby Yazdani, Hank Vigil, Fritz Lanman, Coyote Ridge Ventures, SaaS Capital and Streamlined Ventures. Mah suggested that inDinero has been pseudo bootstrapping  obviously, its raising outside funding, so its not actually bootstrapped, but none of the investors are taking a board seat, allowing her to go straight to the growth equity firms if she decides to raise more money later.The company has now raised a total of $10 million. Mah also noted that inDineros previous investors still have their stakes in the company.Despite what appears to be a successful turnaround, she isnt sugarcoating the companys past failure. Mah suggested that any business trying to build the aforementioned Mint for small business will have a very difficult time making money, especially if theyre not the marketplace or payment processor.Thats my belief  I wasted almost three years of my life on it, which is really painful, she said.
