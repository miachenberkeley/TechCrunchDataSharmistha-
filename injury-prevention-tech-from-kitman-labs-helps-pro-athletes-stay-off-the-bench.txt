Last season, the Los Angeles Lakers paidKobe Bryant $23.5 million as he saton the bench indefinitely with a torn rotator cuff. Thats just a fraction of the $500 million that injured players salaries cost professional sports teams last year alone.To keep more of their players in the starting lineup, NFL, MLB and NBA teams are increasingly turning to Kitman Labs. The Menlo Park-based startup is leveraging data analytics to prevent injuries, which, aside from being absurdly costly, can mean the difference between winning andlosingthe NBA Finalsor the World Series.Kitman Labs was founded by Stephen Smith, a former Irish rugbyhead trainer who ran into some obstacleswhileconducting trials forhis masters thesis on the risk factors of athlete injury.We collected close to 100 precursors of athlete injury for three years, like stress, fatigue, sleep hours, and exposure to certain activities, and found that there was no correlation, says Smith. Humans are too unique, theres not a specific threshold orspecific variables that increase the rate of injury in everyone.So Smith started building an artificial intelligence layer that could apply the data hed collected to each athlete on an individualbasis. This approach worked much better: thefirst professional rugby team to use the platform reduced injury by over 30 percent and increased player availability by 10 percent over the course of two years, Smith says.In order to assess an athletes health and injury profile, Kitman Labs captures data from a variety of sources. Perhaps the most revolutionary is the startups 3D video-based screening tool, called Capture, that scans an athletes movements without the help of any wearables or sensors.Using a camera with infrared light, Capture is able to identify an athletes joints at the accuracy level of a biomechanical lab. While the lab takes around 30minutes to set up and another 30minutes to conduct a test, however, Capture can fit in a backpack and test an athlete in thirty seconds.As you stand in front of the Surface Pro tablet, the computerinstructs you to jump. From that single exercise, Capture collects and crunches16,000 data pointstospit out a series of graphs demonstrating range of motion, weight distribution, balance and strength.This is one of the biggest game changers in sports, says Smith. Now we can quantify whats going on, instead of telling athletes theyre better or worse based on what theyre telling us.Along with the results collected by Capture, athletes are prompted to enter feedback about their perceived sleep quality, appetite, pain levels, and psychological well being into the Kitman Labs app. They can also integrate third-party data sources, including GPS trackers, heart-rate variability monitors and force plate sensors.Team doctorscan enter medical test results for each player, and the coaching staff can input information about individual and team performance, and athlete schedules.Kitmans analytics platformsynthesizes all of this information and producesreports on both individual athletes and overall team health. Coaches can overlay the teams workout schedule and win/loss record to look for correlations between practice intensity, athlete health, and in-game performance.Its not rocket science, were just surfacing the relevant information for them to understand that when they do X activity, its causing this type of stress report in athletes, Smith says.For pro teams, the competitiveadvantagesof truly understandinghow athletes respond to stressare obvious. So obvious, in fact, that many of the professionalteams usingKitmans platformarent willing to be publicly named.Transforming the pro sports industry, however, isjust the first goalinSmiths long-term visionfor Kitman Labs.There is no better dataset to prove this concept, because nobody is scrutinized more than professional athletes, says Smith. But we believe this is the optimization of humans, whether youre a firefighter or you work at Google.Facebook image: Flickr | Keith Allison
