Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. CUNY journalism professor, bloggerand social media gadfly,Jeff Jarvis, is not stranger to controversy. And he was in characteristically outspoken form when I caught up with him at the NYC DLD conference to talk about the 2016 election.Jarvis  who is a Hillary supporter  told me that Trump, is the emperor troll. And Bernie Sanders isnt much different, he insists.Both Trump and Sanders, Jarvis argues, are tied together by theiranger and their narcissistic use of traditional political platforms and parties to get individual attention.So when can we expect the digital revolution to have a healthily innovative impact on politics? Here, Jarvis who has written extensively about Johannes Guttenbergs 15th century invention of the printing press  takes the long view.We are still quite early in a digital revolution, he insists, which may take a century or two to fully work itself out. So for those of us horrified by todays selfie-politics, he suggests patience. Meanwhile, dont feed the trolls. And vote for Hillary in 16, Jarvis says.As always, many thanks to the folks at CALinnovatesfor their support in the production of this interview.
