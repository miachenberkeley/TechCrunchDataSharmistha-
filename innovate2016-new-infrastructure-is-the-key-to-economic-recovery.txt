As the founder and CEO ofSmartcar, a soon to be launched start-up, Sahas Katta is very much focused oninfrastructure for the connected car.For Katta, who made his name in 2013 reverse engineeringhis dads Tesla Model S, the key infrastructure to ensure the success of the connected car remains our roads. And they needa serious upgrade, Katta insists.New roads (rather than new walls) are,therefore, the key to reinventing the Americaneconomy.So the real conversation that the 2016 candidates should be having, he says, is about how to make our roads ready for the connected car.Unfortunately, neither Hilary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz nor Donald Trump are talking transportation infrastructure and thus are all missing one oneof the most important drivers of innovation in the American economy, Katta argues.CalifornianGovernor Jerry Brown gets it, Sahas says, with his proposal to raise money by taxing people on the amount that they drive. But this kind of State based innovation isnt being replicated at the Federal level.As always, many thanks to CALinnovatesfor their help in the production of this interview.
