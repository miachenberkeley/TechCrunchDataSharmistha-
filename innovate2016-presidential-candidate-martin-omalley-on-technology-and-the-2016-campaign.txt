Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. Heres the first of my exclusive interviews with the 2016 candidates  with former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley who I spoke to at his campaign headquarters in Baltimore.Along with Bernie Sanders, OMalley is the only credible alternative in the Democratic party to Hillary Clinton. In contrast with Sanders, however, the relatively youthful OMalley is really focused on reinventing innovation in America and fusing it with a 21st century social justice.So how does OMalley see Silicon Valley and whats his position on politically sensitive tech issues like Network Neutrality, the sharing economy, spectrum and the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs?As always, many thanks to the folks at CALinnovates for their support in the production of this interview.
