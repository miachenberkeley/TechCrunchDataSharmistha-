Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. For somebody who proudly identifies himself as a venture socialist, August Capital general partner David Hornik  certainly has a lot of faith in the free market.Its the real solution to most of our current economic problems, Hornik believes, particularly in the way in which Silicon Valley experimentation can educate the rest of the economy.But Hornik is no Silicon Valley libertarian. Indeed, he thinks that regulation has an important role in tempering some of the more traumatic consequences of disruption  especially in the sharing economy.-Its all too easy to stereotype all venture capitalists as selfish, uncaring libertarians. So Horniks venture socialism is reassuring. It shows that, even in Silicon Valley, political idealism still exists. Perhaps Bernie Sanders should spend more time here.Thanks to the AT&T Foundry for hosting this interview. And thanks again to CALinnovates for producing the video.
