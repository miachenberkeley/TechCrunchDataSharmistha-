Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. 1776, Washington DCs leading incubatorof technology start-ups, describes itself as where revolutions begin. But according to Brandon Pollack, 1776s Director of Global Affairs, that revolution will only begin in partnership with government.1776, as Pollock notes, invests in what he calls entrenched verticals  regulated areas of the economy like healthcare, energy, education and smart cities which cant be disrupted by working completely outside the political process. Thus 1776s place both in Washington DC and as the most prolific incubator in areas like healthcare, energy, education and smart cities.The view from DC of the Obama administrations record on innovation is quite rosy Obama, Pollock says, gets an A on innovation  a grade with which not everyone in Silicon Valley will agree. But Pollock appears less optimistic about a post Obama America.Its quite unique  the weirdest election the DC veteran has experienced and hes disappointed with the absence of discussion about innovation amongst the candidates. As Pollock notes, the only candidates who have stressed the innovation economy  Marco Rubio and Martin OMalley  are no longer in the race. So much, then, for innovation in 2016.As always, many thanks to CALinnovatesfor their help in the production of this interview.
