Who wonthe Republican debate at the Venetian on TuesdayI was in the spin room immediately after the event with a film crew and got immediate reaction from a number of luminaries including Republican Nevada Senator Dean Heller, former Bush chief media advisor Mark McKinnon and CNN anchor Jake Tapper.While it was difficult to determine winners, I thought Trump performed poorly  although judging from the enormous crowds surrounding TheDonald in the spin room, youd think hed just won the Presidency. Spin, spin, spin.ButI also sat down for substantial conversations with a number of prominent Republicans including Congressman Darrell Issa, RNC strategy head Sean Spicer and prominent Stanford University thinker and Rubio advisor LanHee Chen.More of these interviews in the coming weeks on Innovate2016andIm in Baltimore next week to interview Governor Martin OMalley.Many thanks to CALinnovatesand Lincoln Labsfor helping to produce the Las Vegas show.
