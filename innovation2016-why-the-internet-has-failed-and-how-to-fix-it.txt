Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. There are few more politically impassioned venture capitalists than Albert Wenger, a partner at Union Square Ventures.Wengers vision of a better tech future is laid out in the rough draft of a book which also lays out his critique of our current digital predicament.Whats happened, Wenger insists, is that power now resides with massive centralizing corporations like Google and Facebook and thus the Internet no longer reflects the interests of its users.The digital revolution has, he says, pretty much failed. But not all is lost.Wenger has a three part solution to fix the future based on economic freedom, informational freedom, and  all of which rests of putting power back into the hands of users.Wengers voice is incredibly important. Unlike so many Silicon Valley based VCs, hes not just in the tech investment game for the money. But hes no venture socialist either and his vision of a radically reinvented and democratized Internet is firmly rooted in the free market.As always, many thanks to CALinnovatesfor their support in producing this interview.
