So thats nice.The PC MarketPlease make the following sound with your face: Womp, womp. Heres the breakdownvia Intels release:Thats not so good. Keep in mind that the PC market is large, with many players. The above means that other OEMs, and participants like Microsoft, likely arent have a ball.GuidanceCall it outlook if you will, but Intel expects revenue of $14.8 billion in the holiday quarter. Presumably a chunk of that will come from the traditionally strong PC sales cycle that takes place around Christmas.Intel expects its gross margin to slip 100 basis points to a round figure of 62 percent. Those figures imply profitability not wildly different from the now-past quarter.Intel remains a company in transition, looking to new revenue streams to supplement and replace falling PC incomes; the decline of its PC dollars is not Intels fault, per se, but is instead more of a reflection on the stale, and slipping PC market itself.Shares of Intel are now mostly flat in after-hours trading.
