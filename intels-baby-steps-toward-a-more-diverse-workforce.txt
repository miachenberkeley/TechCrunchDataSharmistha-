Earlier this year, Intel announced its $300 million commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. CEO Brian Krzanich set a goal that, by 2020, Intels U.S. workforce would be representative of the talent available. Today, the company released its mid-year diversity report, highlighting the progress its made toward that goal.In order to achieve its goal, Intel is focused onthe hiring and retention of women and underrepresented minorities, even though diversity encompasses a lot more than women and underrepresented minorities.This year, Intel has already surpassed its hiring goals with 43.3 percent of its new hires being female or coming from an underrepresented ethnic group. Intels goal was to increase its diverse hiring to 40 percent, up from just 20 percent a year ago, according to USA Today.There are also more African-Americans and women working at Intel today than there were at the beginning of the year. In December 2014, 3.4 percent of Intels U.S. workforce was black. Today, 3.5 percent of its workforce is black.Thatstechnically progress, but those are baby steps when Intel and other tech companies need to be taking giant leaps toward diverse and inclusive workplaces.Meanwhile, Intels employee representation of Hispanic and Native American people has not changed at all, while its workforce remains mostly white (54.2 percent) and male (75.9 percent).Also, wheres the data about the representation of LGBTQ people and employees in other protected classes?Anyway, you can check out the full diversity report here.
