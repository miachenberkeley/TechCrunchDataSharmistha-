If youre sending emails or other messages to your customers, theres a standard way to measure your success  you look at whether they opened those messages, and whether the openers actually clicked.But thats setting the bar kind of low isnt it? I assume youre usually trying to drive some sort of behavior, whether its making a purchase, trying out a new feature, reactivating an account, or whatever. Thats what customer communication company Intercom aims to measure with a new feature called Message Goals.I still think theres absolutely value in seeing the open rate and click rate, but with these goals you can actually see the true impact, said Matt Hodges, the companys senior director of marketing.He added that this can be particularly useful when paired with Intercoms A/B testing capabilities, because it allows you to find the message thats actually driving the outcome youre looking for.Take Intercom customer and early Message Goals user Magoosh, which offers online test prep. When Magoosh tries to re-enage with its users, its easy to focus on getting those kids to open an email and maybe click on a link, but the real challenge is actually getting them to actually start studying again.Intercom is including Message Goals in its Engage package of tools for marketers.
