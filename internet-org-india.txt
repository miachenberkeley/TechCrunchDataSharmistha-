Facebooks Internet.org project to provide basic mobile Internet services for free just took its biggest step to date after it launched in India.The service, which is run byInternet.org with input from a number of telecom industry partners,has thus far been available in a handful of African countriesand Colombia, but now it is making its way to Indias billion-plus population.The app isnt available to the full Indian population yet, since Facebookpartnered with operator Relianceto offer free access to Internet.org sites in an initial six states:Tamil Nadu, Mahararashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, and Telangana. Thats the first step on a path to provide Internet access to more than a billion people in India who arent yet connected, Facebook said in a statement.Most of the services on Internet.org are available in English and six local languages Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati and Marathi  and they can be accessed via the dedicated Android app, the start screen on Operas Mini browser or fromUCWebs popular UC Browser app.There are an initial 38 websites and services bundled into the free service in India. The selection ranges from Facebook and Facebook Messenger (of course), to news services BBC, Reuters, ESPN and India Today  music site Hungama, news aggregator NewsHunt, Wikipedia and government relations site AP Speaks. Othergeneral services include travel, weather, sports and parenting information.Expansion to India has been on the cards for some time after Facebook launcheda $1 million funddedicated to making apps for India at its Internet.org summit in New Delhi last year.Emerging markets are an important focus for Facebook since it has long become a mainstream service in Western markets, and the lions share of new Internet users willcome onlinefrom Africa, Asia and Latin America via mobile phones. Facebook CEOMark Zuckerberg previously likened Internet.org to a 911 telephone call, thats to say that basic services should be available to everyone on the planet without charge in the same way that you can call the copsfor free.Of course, the benefits of more people trying out mobile Internet services is that they might find the web compelling and go out andbuy a smartphone, data plan or pre-pay SIM with mobile Internet. Thats good news for Facebook  more advertising eyeballs and users  not to mention the online/telecom industry in general, which explains the involvement of companies likeSamsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Nokia and Opera.Aside from Internet.org, Facebook recently piloteda new Lite version of its service for Android devices. That app  which is based on Facebooks TaptuSnaptu feature phone service is specifically designed to work well with low-end phones and flaky data connections,providingusers in emerging marketsanother option for spending time on the social network.
