Earlier this week I took a call with Hussein Kanji, who, along with Rob Kniaz, is founding partner of London-based VC Hoxton Ventures, a relatively new fund that already has a growing reputation as one of the more ambitious new kids on the VC block.And, although we didnt get to talk about it, he is also part owner of a bakery chain in London, proof that VCs rarely put all of their bread rolls in one basket.During the pretty relaxed interview we talked on the age-old topic of Europe vs Silicon Valley, how you spot a Unicorn in the making  that is a startup that goes on to be valued at a billion dollars or more  and his own motivations.We also discussed Hoxton Ventures portfolio companies Deliveroo and Darktrace, both of which Kanji is extremely bullish about.And I finally cleared up something that has bugged me for a while: Why is the VC firm called Hoxton Ventures when it isnt even located in Hoxton?You can listen to the lightly edited interview below.
