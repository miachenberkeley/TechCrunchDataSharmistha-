Disrupt NY 2015 is days away and were thrilled to announce the TechCrunch video team will be broadcasting interviews, updates, and great startup action live from the Exhibit Hall floor.In the past, our video teamhas been hidden backstage, occasionally sneaking out from inside a secret lair with cameras and microphones. This year TechCrunch TV Live will quite literally be in the middle of Startup Alley broadcasting and recording additional content from the heart of the show.The TechCrunch TV Live schedule is packed with amazing companies and founders and nicely complements the agenda of the main stage. Come check us out at Disrupt, which runs from May 4  6 at the historic Manhattan Center in New York City.And, of course, be sure to keep your eyes glued to TechCrunch video throughout the show to see the vast array of content planned for the show.
