Prototyping suite InVision just announced they are acquiring Silver Flows, a tool that lets developers prototype directly inside Sketch. The acquisition comes just a few months after InVision acquired the code-based design tool Macaw, and is the companys fourth acquisition to date.Silver Flows, which is currently in private beta, removes the hassle of designing in Sketch then prototyping inside a separate tool. Before Silver Flowsdesigners would have to make graphics in Sketch then manually move them into a different prototyping app.As a result of the acquisition, thetool willsoon be incorporated into Craft, which is InVisions suite of design plugins.Once incorporated into Craft, designers will be able to leverage InVisions cloud based feedback tools while working inside Sketch. In other words, all prototypesand design changes will automatically sync with shareable InVision files, and vice versa (all changes in InVision will sync to Sketch files).By expanding their brandinto Sketch and acquiring yet another popular design tool, InVision is making it clear that they hope to eventuallyown the entire design and prototyping workflow, essentiallybecoming a one stop shop for web and app designers.
