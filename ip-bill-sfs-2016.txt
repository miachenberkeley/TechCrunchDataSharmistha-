On Thursday ahalf-day conference taking placein Londons Kings College heard a range of viewsaboutthe U.K.s draft Investigatory Powers Bill, currently before parliament. The governments intention with the IP Bill is to pass legislationthatcements and extends the surveillance capabilities of domesticintelligence and law enforcement agencies to keep pace with tech developments in the 15 years or so since existinglegislation was formulated.Speakers at the event described it as a historic opportunity for the U.K. to lead the world increating a transparent legal framework for the operation of secret state surveillance powers. However others noted the sameopportunitymeans there is a parallel risk of badly cast legislationenshrining surveillance overreach and encouraging other countries down a similarly problematicpath. The stakes, all agreed, could not be higher.The timetable for examining what is a complex, technical and lengthy (running to some 300-pages) piece of legislation is relatively short, given thegovernment wants to whole process to be done and dusted with an act in place by the end of the year when a sunset clause means existing emergency surveillance legislation, DRIPA, willexpire.The government has already been accused oftrying to undermine the work ofthejoint select committee,currently examining the IP bill, by not giving itenough time to do a proper job. So there is also a very real risk of inadequate scrutiny of complex proposals with opaqueimplications resulting in majorcollateral damage to citizens privacy and security.And potentially alsoto the competitiveness of U.K.-based Internet companies, if businesses end up losing thetrust of users because of ill-thought-through legal requirements foisted on them by politicians.One plainlywordedintervention came fromApple last month, with the company warning in a statement submitted to the bill committee that: The bill threatens to hurt law-abiding citizens in its effort to combat the few bad actors who have a variety of ways to carry out their attacks. The creation of backdoors and intercept capabilities would weaken the protections built into Apple products and endanger all our customers. A key left under the doormat would not just be there for the good guys. The bad guys would find it too.Another Snoopers Charter?The IP billwasintroduced to the U.K. parliament by Home Secretary Theresa May in November. As well as thejoint select committee, due to report in mid-February, a bill committee will also examine it, line by line. And itwill be put through Parliamentand House of Lords scrutiny in the coming months, allowing for MPs and Peers to debate its measures and propose and vote on amendments  before any vote on afinal bill, incorporatingany agreed amendments, can take place.Assuming, of course, the legislation is not derailed by majority opposition during the scrutiny process. The Conservative governments prior attempt to legislate in this area  the 2012 Communications Data Bill (CDB)  had to be withdrawnwhen the governmentsthen coalition partner, the Liberal Democracts, refused to support it, dubbing it a Snoopers Charter.The new IP Bill has also been branded a Snoopers Charter by critics, not least because it includes an expansion of surveillance powers  such as a requirement that ISPs logand store details of the websites users havevisited for a full 12 months. It alsosanctions bulk equipment interference  aka the mass hacking of devices  as an investigatory tool. And has some worrying wording aroundencryption, hence Apples concerns.More broadly, the billseeks to give explicit legalblessing tomass surveillance, at a point whenthe U.S. has been making moves in the opposite direction, reviewing and rolling back so-called bulk collection initiatives, via the likes of theUSA Freedom Act. At the same time,UN andEuropean rights bodies, including the European Court of Justice,have censured mass surveillance on human rights grounds  calling it a threat to democracy.In the U.K., its been theoppositestory since the the 2013 Snowden revelations, with continued government attempts to shore up, rather thanroll back,mass surveillance  culminating in the current bidto enshrine the practiceat the core of the surveillance state by giving it a legal footing, balanced  arguesupporters  by robust oversight safeguards.Safeguards that critics of the bill counterare not nearly robust enough.Security is onecore critical theme, with concerns, for instance, aboutthe vasthoneypot of user data the billproposes to create,via provisions such asthe aforementionedInternet Connection Records, risking becomingan inevitable target for hackers orblackmailers. And concerns aboutgovernment agencies working to intentionally exploit and enlarge vulnerabilities in software and systems. So theU.K. government stands accused of, on the one hand, claiming its increasing investment in cyber security, while at the same time tryingto handa mandate toanotherset of government-funded actors to undermine digital security at will.Theopposition viewThe Conservatives are a majority government so dont need a junior political partnerto sign up to their legislative plans to get bills through Parliament, meaning the IP bill lookslikely to faceless opposition than the failed CDB. And its not at all clear thatthe official opposition Labour party has any philosophicalobjections to increasing the capabilities of the surveillance state. Or to the practiceof mass surveillance, specifically.Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the bill when it was introduced in November, couching it asneither a Snoopers Charter nor mass surveillance  although he subsequently wrote to the Home Secretary saying the party wanted to see stronger safeguardsput in place in the legislation, especially around the issue of judicial sign off for authorizing interception warrants.Speaking at the Foundation for Information Policy Researchs Scrambling for Safety 2016 event on Thursday, Labour MP Keir Starmer, who notedhe would be the partys lead on the IP bill,said its clear new legislationis needed togovern surveillance powers, given that theoutdated and often obscure patchwork of existing legislation currentlyused to authorize surveillance activity is long past its sell by date.He also said he supports expanding state surveillance capabilities  but also with a caveat onsafeguards.There is a requirement for extended powers, said Starmer. But just as powers are extended so must safeguards be  and this must be the absolute governing principle, I think  from the Labour party point of view, from any point of view The safeguards have to be more robust, more transparent than they were before.He went on to argue that the so-called double lock sign off mechanism for intercept warrants proposed in the bill, which would meanthe Home Secretaryretains the powerto sign off intercept warrantsbut a judge must also sign off the same warrant (although there is also a provision allowing warrants to be signed off by theminister in emergencies and retroactively looked at by a judge), would only be appropriate if judges play a real part, rather than what he described as thelong arm judicial review currently proposed.I do think that if judges are to play a part theyve got to play a real part, he said. And therefore an exercise whichis in truth a rubberstamp is not worth having. Close up scrutiny  looking at the material kind of our use of these intrusive powers  is a different proposition.Data protection and data retention provisions in the bill will also require greater scrutiny, Starmer added.But the former director of public prosecutionsalso took time to flag up what he couched as the vital role played by communications data when it comes to investigating and prosecuting serious and difficult cases  giving the example of the thwarted 2006 plot to simultaneously bring down multiple airplanes mid way over the Atlantic.There was a very elaborate plot that was uncovered in real time in a number of places, including in North London. And there was a real scramble to get the data available very quickly because once it became clear there was a plot it was very important to move from that stage to stopping any part of that plot being implemented, he said.In very many cases we would not have been able to prosecute without the sort of data that was made available because of the existing [surveillance] regime, he added, thereby giving tacit support to so-called bulk collection.Call for a moretargeted approachSpeaking during another panel, Shami Chakrabarti, director of U.K. civil rights advocacy organizationLiberty, arguedthat the currentapplicationof surveillance capabilitiesin the U.K. has in fact yet to be justified arguing thatfar more debate needs to take place about targeting.Just because things were happening outside the law and it is now proposed to put them inside the law doesnt mean that weve got the balance right, she said,addingthat targeted surveillancehas been the traditional approach in open, democratic societies, rather than the mass surveillance measures set to beenshrinedin law if the bill passes in its current form.Its notable that the IPT, the oversight court for the U.K.s intelligence agencies, last year ruled against GCHQfor thetime in its fifteen year history (anddid so on more than one occasion), deciding, in one ruling, that the agencyhad acted unlawfully in its data sharing activities with the NSA. Yetdespite such rulings,the U.K. political establishment appears almost entirelycomfortable with  and ready to legislate for mass surveillance.I completely applaud and supportthe idea we must now come out of the shadows when setting the legal framework that will then be applied, of course, often in the shadows but we still must have a debate, arguedChakrabarti. Just because things were happening without public knowledge or parliamentary insight, let alone judicial sign off, doesnt mean that the balance is yet correct  that we have proportionality [when it comes to state use ofmass surveillance].Shewent on to arguethat proportionality principles, as applied under the European Convention of Human Rights, have generally required a more targeted approach to surveillance than you see in many parts of this bill.That is a real challenge, she added, emphasizing itsher viewthat anoperational case for using mass surveillancehas still yet to beproven.The risks of overreachVarious specific concerns about the proposed legislation were also aired on Thursday withspeakers from a range of NGOs, and legal and industry bodies, as well as politicians, discussing the draft bill in three themed panel sessions, with questions taken from the audience.Panelists were, for instance, asked how police or intelligence agencies would be able to assess the risks of hackinga particular piece of equipment  sanctioned by the IP bill under itsequipment interference and bulk equipment interference (aka: mass hacking) provisions  given the complex interplay of digital devices and services already evident in a nascent but growing Internet of Things.Might there not be huge potential risks, even potentially risks to life, of interfering with digitalservices, asked oneaudience member  and how could an untargeted process such as mass hacking avoid generating unknown collateral damage, let alone be judged proportionate by those authorizing such activity?On the question of how do you assess the risks of interfering with a technology, if youre going to do at all it needs to be extremely targeted, argued Caroline Wilson Palow,of civilrights advocacy organisation Privacy International. Otherwise you cant judge proportionality  you dont know what device youre targeting, you dont know who is actually going to be subject to this type of interference, then how can you possibly judge proportionality?This problem we have with the powers across the bill, not only withequipment interference, she added.Another speaker at the event, Malcolm Hutty of Internet infrastructure membership organizationLinx, also raised concerns about the risks of state actorscausing unknown damage via legalized hacking activity.If you were to hack into a DSLAM or something like that, you might think that thats only supplying broadband service for a relatively small area  it cant be that significant can it?But in fact how do you know whether that it providing, amongst other things, the back up line for some safety critical service, maybe a water purification system or a monitoring system for somebodys health.The idea that an intelligence officer can assess what the likely impact would be if that vulnerability that they exploit and maybe exacerbate  that they could assess the impact of that without knowing not only what that system is and how it works but how it was used seems to me to be deeply problematic.The consequences of a mis-assessment of that range from the minor to the wholly catastrophic, he added. Its our view that this particular part of the bill needs to be made much tighter, not in the interests of the balance between privacy and security, but to avoid doing significant harm to the security of the U.K.Anthony Walker of trade association TechUK, warned ofthe potential economic impact ofcompanies losing the trust of users as a result of beingsubject to explicitly broad state surveillance powers.This question around equipment interference has some real direct relevance in terms of the extent to which companies are subjected to these kind of broad powers can potentially sell their services around the world. And that can be trusted by their customers around the world. I think thats a really significant commercial and economic impact that we need to bear in mind, he said.Healso arguedthat many aspects of the bill, including specifically the language aroundencryption, is too vague  and is therefore opento interpretation. (A point also made to the joint select committee last month.)There is definitely more work to be done to improve the transparency of the bill. What are these powers? What do they actually mean? And in many ways I think companies are struggling to really understand and fully understand the implications of the bill because there are too many aspects of the bill that they just simply dont know what it means, he said.Walker also warned of the risks ofthe U.K. being out of step with other countriesapproach tosurveillance legislation, arguing that being an outliermight well becounterproductive byjeopardizingthe international co-operations needed for data to flow across borders.The more that we insert extraterritorial powers into the bill the more that we go against some of the norms that are emerging elsewhere, the harder that international co-operation becomes. So the extraterritorial issue is, I think, very important because it potentially undermines the security objectives were all trying to achieve, he said.Technology is global, the threats that we face today are global, the axis are global, companies are global. If the security services are going to be able to access the information they need at the time that they need it that depends upon international co-operation betweenagencies, between companies, he added.
