A simple PIN might keep your iPhone safe from the prying hands of a curious toddler or a drunk friend. But slap that thing in a robot that exists for no reason but to try every possible PIN one-by-one, and itll crack it right open.These machines have existed for a while, but this one is particularly crazy: if youve got your iPhone set to clear all of its data after 10 failed guesses, itll try to exploit its way past that.Note the try in that last sentence: while were still waiting on confirmation from Apple on this one, theres a good chance that the trickery at play here only works if youre on a build of iOS older than iOS 8.1.1 (Shipped November 2014). Apples notes for 8.1.1 mention patching a bug (CVE-2014-4451) that could circumvent the the maximum number of failed passcode attempts; its not clear if thats the same bug at play here, though it seems likely.Heres the device in use, via MDSec, who was able to obtain the bruteforcer for around $300:It can be a bit hard to tell whats going on in the video, so heres what youre looking at:Because each failed attempt requires a reset, each run takes roughly 44 seconds. If it fails until the very last try on a 4-digit password, thats 4.5 days of bruteforcing. Thats not exactly Hollywood spy movie speed hackery  but if theyve outright stolen your phone and really want to see whats inside, its plenty quick.So, how can you protect your device from this?Weve reached out to Apple for comment on the status of the exploit at play in the video, but have yet to hear back.
