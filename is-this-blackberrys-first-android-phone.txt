For the past month or so, the general thinking around the rumor mill has been that BlackBerry is working on an Android phone. If you cant beatem, joinem, right?Now weve got a rough idea of what their first Android handset might look like.Posted by the endlessly resourceful Evan Blass (aka evleaks), the photo shows a device that appears to have curves on both halves of its display  not unlike Samsungs Galaxy S6 Edge. Its said to be called the BlackBerry Venice, though thats likely a codename..@akrnsv Not at all  Venice is actually quite the looker. pic.twitter.com/ToFgYNOuLw Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 3, 2015If youre paying extra close attention, you might note that the general silhouette of the device is quite similar to something that BlackBerry themselves quietly showed off back at Mobile World Congress in March. That device, however, appeared to be running BlackBerrys own BB10 OS:What a Surprise! Ron just pulled out a dual-curved, all-touch display with a Keyboard  yes a slider device! #MWC15 pic.twitter.com/8VaPUZHo3j BlackBerry (@BlackBerry) March 3, 2015See that slide-out keyboard in the second photo? Its unclear if the rumored Android build will cram something like that under its curved display; while it seems like a tight squeeze, the leaked render up above certainly doesnt eliminate the possibility.Including a slide-out keyboard in their first dip into Android would be a good move on BlackBerrys part. The Android market is filled to the rim with competition  but its lacking many phones with solid physical keyboards, particularly if youre looking for something with up-to-date specs.A device like this would appeal to an underserved niche and help coax some of the folks clinging onto their aging BlackBerry devices into the brave, new Android-powered BlackBerry world. It wont let BlackBerry take over the Android market overnight, but itll help them get a foot in the door.
