Editors note:Jess Kimball Leslie is a writer based in New York. She is working on a collection of essays about life after the Internet.The great story of Silicon Valley:A company, once ahead of its time, ceases to innovate for almost a decade while continuing to make billions off its legacy business model  ad sales. Then that once-great company dies.In the proud American tradition of AOL,Yahoo, and GeoCities, I present YouTube. Ever notice how itshomepage looks almost the same as it did in 2008? No, really:Todays homepage:For the first time in a decade,YouTubes dominance as the destination for video content is being challenged by rivals like Facebook. While the press admires the success of Bethany Mota and tours the lush new coastalYouTubestudios, Facebook has spotted the companys many weaknesses and is going on the attack.Theres still plenty of hope forYouTube, however. Heres how the company could shore things up in2015.In the past year,YouTubespent a fortune on its two new production studios, intended as well-equipped playgrounds for its most valued and viewed performers. The idea is cool, sure, but I dont think it should have taken precedent over re-thinking theYouTube experience (more on that in a bit).The best YouTubers dont emerge from high-tech studios, they emerge from out of nowhere. Smosh, PewDiePie  just some of the talent YouTubeloves to trot out for its press pieces  succeeded despite theYouTubesystem, not because of it. They built audiences in a cluttered, ugly, ad-soaked swamp, where 100 new hours of competitive video are uploaded every minute.Unlike at a movie studio,YouTubedid not rescue PewDiePie from obscurity. InsteadYouTubegot on board in the 11th hour, when the success had already happened and the risk of failing was so low that only an idiot could have lost money.Unlike the great studio mavericks of past and present,YouTubes executives are not gamblers, nor are they artists.YouTubes approach to talent is more actuarial that artistic, and thats fine (I guess, sigh), but the company shouldnt pretend to be something its not.I once got to witness aSeinfeldwriter sharingYouTubeclips with fellow Hollywood writers, and it was a totally miraculous event. Working artists useYouTubes bank of content as a movable feast; they get together on Friday nights and share clips ranging from Nichols & May sketches to Bill Hicks rants and discuss what makes each piece great. This is how the modern artist studies their art form. The dialogues that successful performers are already having aroundYouTubeclips is, well, world-changing for anyone who wants to learn how to tell a story.ImagineYouTubebundling and selling master classes with accomplished entertainers. (In addition, imagine the company following in Apples lead and thinking about design first instead of ad sales, therefore creating something worth paying for.) Imagine lengthy collections ofYouTubeclips, curated and narrated by your favorite star. Imagine Shonda Rhimes on writing great cliffhangers, or Tina Fey on improv.Premium content brings us to a vital side point:YouTubeshould allow us all to buy our way out of advertisements, out of endlessly closing pop-ups throughout the entire length of a clip.Bad ads are another crucial point forYouTubeto address this year. I cant count the number of times Ive seen an ad in a heartlessly inappropriate place, like right before a family tries to raise money to treat their kids cancer. How is it thatYouTubeso frequently embodies the very worst of the old-world Internet (unaware of its context), and the very worst of the new Internet (wildly obsessed with ad sales) at the very same time?ImagineYouTubewith a mood selector on its homepage, la Beats. Beats is brilliant because it considers thewhybefore thewhat. Why do I end up atYouTube.com? Sometimes my brother-in-law is visiting and we like to watch weird 1990s mashup videos. Sometimes I could use a laugh at work. Sometimes I want to find some cute animal videos to laugh at with my kid before bedtime.ImagineYouTubeasking questions like:Who are you with?(A little kid  so the content must be G-rated, etc.)Do you feel like being: grossed out; inspired; entertained by goatsYouTubeneeds the Beats questionnaire for video. This is itsnew mini app, itsMessenger.YouTubehas an incredible advantage over most Internet properties: Its No. 3on the Alexa Top Sites lists. No. 3!And itsnot even trying! Ive had aYouTubeaccount for a million years, I watch all kinds of content on it, and still the best its homepage can do to guess at what Ill like is this:Copy the Gawker bored at work business model; hire some editors.YouTubeshould challenge itself to perform more like BuzzFeed, which, for all its faults, does immediately engage the user off of its homepage content and context.Facebook is always able to kill off its rivals because itsthecontent destination side of the world.YouTubeis the one company that, with a better user experience, could genuinely compete as another destination. Its only one Alexa ranking away.
