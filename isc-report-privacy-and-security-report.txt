In a report published today, theU.K. parliaments Intelligence and SecurityCommittee has called for a new single act of Parliament to govern how domestic spy agencies operate with the aim of improving transparency and public trust.It dubs itsreport an important first step towards greater transparency.The 149-page report is the cumulation of a year long inquiry by the committee, set against the backdrop of ongoing revelations derivedfrom documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (some of which have specifically pertained to the U.K. GCHQ spy agency), with the aim of examining the operations of the UK intelligence and security agencies  looking specifically at (in the committeesown words):The committee claims to havefound no evidence of U.K. government agencies seeking to circumvent the law, but doesflag up what it says is a lack of clarity inthe existing legislation  pointing to this as havingfuelled suspicion about agencies activities.Minor reforms and improvements around the edges of the existing legislationare not sufficient in the long term. Therefore, rather than simply reforming RIPA [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act], assome have suggested, we consider that the entire legal framework, as it applies to theintelligence Agencies, needs replacing, the committee writes.The purposes, functions, capabilities and obligations of the Agencies should be clearly
set out in a new single Act of Parliament. This should also include the privacyconstraints, transparency requirements, targeting criteria, sharing arrangements andother safeguards that apply to the use of their capabilities.These changes are overdue, it adds. There is a legitimate public expectation of openness and transparency in todays society. Therefore, while the Agencies must operate in secret if they are to be able to protect us  and we cannot expect them to do their job otherwise  every effort must be made to ensure that information is placed in the public domain when it is safe to do so.So, bottom line here, Snowdens impetus to blow the whistle onintelligenceagency activityoverreachin Western democracies is again being vindicated. Even the establishment is admitting spy agencyoperations have beentoo murky prior to Snowden shining a light.Despite the committees calls for increasedtransparency, various details from the report areredacted(as is typical for intelligence agency-related reports)  including,as The Intercept notes, specific case studies provided to the committee by GCHQ to apparently prove the efficacy of mass surveillance in preventing terrorist attacks. Sotheres no way for the general public to judge for themselves on that point.The committee also claims to have interrogatedthe agencies use of mass surveillance (which it termsbulk interception), as a discovery and/or intelligence gathering tool  and again professes itself satisfied withthe legality of the methods, based on these fishing expeditions being limited in scope; the gathered data being triaged and filtered via search terms; and only a small percentage of the resulting communications being read by human analysts.Given the extent of filtering involved, it is evident that GCHQs bulk interceptioncapability does not constitute blanket surveillance or indiscriminate surveillance, the committee asserts.We have examined cases which demonstrate that bulk interceptionhas exposed previously unknown threats or plots which threatened our security andwhich would not otherwise have been detected. Therefore, in principle, we consider thatbulk interception is an appropriate intelligence-gathering capability that contributes to theUKs national security  as long as it is properly targeted and controlled,it adds.Earlier this year the judicial oversight body for the U.K. intelligence agencies ruled that data-sharing activitiesbetween the NSA and GCHQ had been unlawful prior to December last year,on the grounds that theybreached European human rights law. However that court also deems the agencies current activities lawful  and again the public has to take that judgement on trust, given it is based on non-public court submissions.The parliamentary committee inquiry also touches on the topic of communications metadata  which, given the associated privacy risks, itrecommend should be treatedas a separate category called Communications Data Plus and givengreater safeguards than the narrowly drawn category of Communications Data.It also calls for strengthening safeguards specifically associated withthe capturing of British citizens data (including where Brits are abroad), andimproving safeguards around what it dubs sensitive professions, suchas lawyers or doctors or journalists. On that point, last November it emerged, via a tribunal hearing, that U.K. intelligence agencies had allowed staff to spy on the legally privileged communications between lawyers and their clients.The principles the committee says shouldunderpin the new legal framework its recommending to govern intelligence agencies activities are summed up as: based on explicit avowed capabilities, together with the authorisationprocedures, privacy constraints, transparency requirements, targeting criteria,sharing arrangements, oversight, and other safeguards that apply to the use of thosecapabilities.The committee asserts thatits report contains an unprecedented level of detail about the intrusive capabilities deployed by U.K. intelligence agencies  including identifying for the first time theuse of so-called Bulk Personal Datasets (BPDs):aka large databases containing personal information about awide range of people that areused by intelligence agencies to identify individuals during thecourse of their investigations, to establish links between Subjects of Interest, and toverify information that they have gathered through other means.The Guardianquotes a committee member likening BPDs to a telephone directory, albeit one that only focuses on people in a certain category of interest to the intelligence agencies.Information contained in BPDs is clearly inherently personal, but quite how personal is made plainerlater in the report  whereit is noted that the data canincludedetailssuch as an individuals religion, racial or ethnic origin,political views, medical condition, sexual orientation, andlegally privileged,journalistic or otherwise confidential information.This section of the report is heavilyredacted, including removing details on exactly how many BPDs areheld by the different agencies. The report does specify that thesedatasets vary in size from hundreds to millions of records, and can be acquired by overt and covert channels.The report also notes that the rules governing use of these datasets are not defined in legislation. So, in other words, they lie outside the remit of existing regulation, like RIPA.The committee notes several specific concerns relating to BPDs  includingthat the capability had not previously been acknowledged publicly (prior to its report), meaning privacy issues and other safeguards had not been considered in public or Parliament; that there are no restrictions onhow the data is stored, held, shared and so on, and no legal penalties for misuse; and that access to the datasets is authorized internally without Ministerial approval.(Following the publication of todays report, TheGuardianreports that the U.K. Prime Minister rushedout a statement specifyingthe intelligence services commissioner, Sir Mark Waller, would be given statutory powers of oversight of use of bulk personal datasets.)The committees report directlyquotes MI5s director general claiming that BPDs are not used for fishing expeditions, but rather to follow up on specific intelligence.In his own words: we only access this stuff where there is an intelligence reason to do it. Sowe start off with a threat, a problem, a lead, that then needs to be examined andpursued and either dismissed or lead to action to counter it. That is when we usethe data. It is absolutely not the case that there is anybody in MI5 sat there, justtrawling through this stuff, looking at something that looks interesting; absolutelynot.The extant policy and process safeguards used by the agencies to control and regulate access to the datasets entail legal training, audit processes and disciplinary proceedings.All staff with access to Bulk Personal Datasets are trained on their legalresponsibilities; all searches must be justified on the basis of necessity andproportionality; and all searches may be audited to ensure that any misuse isidentified.However the report also notes that all the intelligence agencies have dealt with cases of inappropriate accessof these BPDs:Each Agency reported that they had disciplined  or in some casesdismissed  staff for inappropriately accessing personal information held in thesedatasets in recent years.
