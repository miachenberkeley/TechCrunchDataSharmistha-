Israel has become known for its security startups, and Scalock, a company that wants to secure the burgeoning container space, announced a $4million Series A round today.The funding was providedby Israel venture capitalists TLV partners, a new fund launched earlier this year by veterans of the Israeli VC scene,Rona Segev and Eitan Bek.The company is run by two security industry veterans,Dror Davidoff and Amir Jerbi, who saw an opportunity in the virtual container market, which has been growing by leaps and bounds over the last two years, led by companies like Docker.Containers help simplify application deployment by isolating different pieces asdistinct components. This is great for developers and operations, who can make changes and redeploy without breaking the working app. Its a process, however that requires severaldifferent helper applicationsto make it work, and thats part of the security problem, Davidoff explained.Once you start working with these containers, you need management, orchestration and monitoring tools. Another complicating factor is that containers by their nature arent static, they are in motion, he says. All of this makes it difficult to secure virtual container technology.Scalock can help in several ways. It begins by analyzing the container and making sure it complies with whatever policies a company has defined. It alsodefines who can access the container, so that unauthorized users (like hackers) are kept at bay. Finally, it protects the container by enforcing the policies defined for the given container as it moves through its lifecycle.Depending on how Scalock is configured, it can fix some issues automatically, while with other types of issues, it would alert users that theres a problem and let them determine how to fix it.The first step is defining thosesecurity policies around the containers and then allowing Scalock to monitor the containers to be sure they comply. A lot of what we do is based on policies and best practices for security and what we learned how about how the container runs [during the analysis phase]. What the container does, we let it do. If it tries to do something different we would alert on that, Davidoff explained.While adding a run-time security layer to the container launch process could slow it down, Davidoff says his companytries to keep anyfrictionto a minimum. We are careful not to impact the advantage of containers, he says.The company, currently is based in Tel Aviv, and plans to keep its engineering team in Israel, but will open an office for the sales and marketing armin Silicon Valley next year.Scalock has 7 employees including the two founders and several beta customers. It hopes to become generally available in the near future.
