Digital media company Issuu has been trying to offer a better way to present content online. Now its a promising a better way for teams to work together on creating that content too, with the launch of a new product called Collaborate.Issuu, for those of you who dont know, allows publishers to create digital publications. They may resemble glossy magazines, except freed from the limitations of print, with support for multimedia and interactive content.The company said that in a survey of more than 1,300 publishers, it found that 64 percent of publishing teams work in different locations, and they rely on everything from email to spreadsheets to Google Docs to InDesign to coordinate. Collaborate is meant to replace many of those tools, creating a central location where a team (particularly a small to medium-sized media team) can create a digital publication together.When you build something in Collaborate, you start with a flatplan, where you can create the layout of your publication and move different pages around. You can also pull layouts from Indesign, if you prefer.Once youre done, you can just publish directly to the Issuu platform, which the company says reaches 100 million readers each month.Collaborate is currently available to customers of Issuus Optimum subscription plan. Oh, and you dont even need to be on a desktop computer to use it  it works on tablets, too.
