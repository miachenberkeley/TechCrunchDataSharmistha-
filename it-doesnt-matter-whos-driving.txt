Force fields arent real, at least not yet. Cars are dangerous. So whether youre in an Uber, Lyft, taxi, or youre driving yourself, buckle your seatbelt.Several friends of minerecently had their Ubers run into by other cars. Luckily, they wereall wearing their seat belts and no one got seriously hurt. But if they werent, if they didnt take those few seconds to buckle up, things could have been much worse. So Im posting this because I dont want that kind of tragedy to befall anyone else.For some reason, lots of people dont buckle up when theyre being transported by a professional driver. Perhaps its the belief that if someone spends that much time behind the wheel, theyll be able to avoidaccidents.But really, it doesnt matter. There will always be other idiots, drunks, and people texting on the road. No amount of driving skill will protect you from someone running a red light at full speed.In some ways, our modern app-based car services are quite safe. GPS and a record of exactly who your driver is create accountability that can potentially deter wrongdoing.Though at the same time, on-demand car service drivers frequently operate on streets theyre not familiar with. They could be distracted by their driver apps beeping about the next pickup or trying to use their navigation system. And some may be relatively new to driving itself.So buckle up at the beginning of every ride. Youll notice its actually more comfortable as you wont get tossed around while weaving through traffic. Want to snuggle with your sweetheart? Strapone of you into the middle seat.The CDC says seat belts reduce the likelihood of serious injuries or death in an accident by half. Do your loved ones a favor. Stay safe.
