UPDATE (1/31/15): Apple has quietly brought iTunes Connect back online. Weve yet to see developers complain about the issue from yesterday since it went back up.UPDATE: Apple seems to have temporarily taken down iTunes Connect.An issue with Apples iTunes Connect service, which lets developers upload new versions of their apps to the App Store and track sales and income, is causing some developers to log into the wrong accounts this morning.The issue emergedas developers, noticing that they had access to apps they clearly did not develop, began posting screenshots on Twitter. As you can see in some of the examples that popped into my timeline, some of the accounts compromised by the bug gave random users access to apps developed by large companies and small, indie developers.Holy shit every time I hit sign out on iTunes Connect it signs me in as a different random user: pic.twitter.com/l2km2nNRBS Mo Bitar (@bitario) January 29, 2015Most definitely was auto logged in to a blackberry account on iTunes connect somehow This isn't mine! pic.twitter.com/S9lujDno95 Bay Phillips (@bayphillips) January 29, 2015@flyosity pic.twitter.com/h3EGj0V4o0 Philip Bernstein (@ozetadev) January 29, 2015@tapbot_paul @matthewmspace yup pic.twitter.com/j2bKYzZvEC William Vabrinskas (@william_vab) January 29, 2015
