Dr. Dre might not be the only rapper in the music streaming business for long. Thats because Jay-Z is making a move to buy Aspiro, a Swedish company that operates theWiMP Music service and Tidal, as it is knownsome markets, according to local media reports.Project Panther, which is owned by Jay-ZsS. Carter Enterprises, has bid464 million Krona (thats around $56 million) to buy the NASDAQ Stockholm-floated company outright, according to a press release. A deal is subject to shareholder agreement but, withAspiros board of directors unanimously recommending that the offer is accepted, its completion seems imminent.WiMP is available in a handful of European markets  Denmark, Germany, Norway, Poland and Sweden  while Tidal offers a higher fidelity service, which boasts a superior qualityof sound thantothe likes of Spotify, Rdio and Deezers services. Available in the UK and the U.S. since October 2014, Tidal is priced at$20 per month, which is around double the main competition.Those two services aside, Aspiro also has a B2b video content platform for publishers called RADR Music News.Apple, of course, acquired Beats  the company Dr. Dre co-founded  for $3 billion last year.A successful headphones business in its own right, many speculated that it was Beats streaming service that prompted Apple to shell out for the company.Dres success  and doubtless vast financial reward from that deal  is unlikely to have gone unnoticed among his peers. As one of the most visible music artists on the planet, it will be fascinating to see exactly what plans Jay-Z has for WiMP and Tidal.
