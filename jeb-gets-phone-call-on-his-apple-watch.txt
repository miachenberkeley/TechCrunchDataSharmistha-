The walking embodimentof the Im a PC guy just discovered that his Apple Watch can make phone calls and he couldnt be more excited :DRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush was doing an interview withThe Des MoinesRegisterwhen his Apple Watch started going crazy. USA Today caught a video of Jebs reaction. My watch cant be talking, he said incredulously.Bush has been a big fan of the Apple Watch, valuing it above such great American pastimes as apple pie, yet it doesnt seem he has a full handle on the devices feature set.They asked me to choose between my Apple Watch and apple pie. Wasnt a tough choice. http://t.co/u07eDJmRbD Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 16, 2015The unelectable Eeyore, who apparently likes to refer to his Watch as his batphone, was reassured by those journalists around him that the Apple Watch does indeed make phone calls.His reply? Thats the coolest thing in the world.
