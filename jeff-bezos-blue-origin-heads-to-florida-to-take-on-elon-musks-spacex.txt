At Exploration Park, well have a 21st century production facility where well focus on manufacturing our reusable fleet of orbital launchers and readying them for flight again and again. Locating vehicle assembly near our launch site eases the challenge of processing and transporting really big rockets.Well be launching from here later this decade. You will hear us before you see us. Our American-made BE-4 engine  the power behind our orbital launch vehicle  will be acceptance tested here. Our BE-4 engine will also help make history as it powers the first flight of United Launch Alliances Vulcan rocket.This space (ha!) is hot and theres a lot of money flowing through private spaceflight already.
