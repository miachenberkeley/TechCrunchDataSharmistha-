For his most recent cover of Bob Dylans Just Like a Woman, Jeff Buckleys creative team has pulled out all the stops. Dropping today is aninteractive music video with a gabazillion possible iterations for the viewer to explore, creating a unique listening experience every time. Not too shabby for an artist who shuffled off this mortal coil almost 20 years ago.Can I just say Its a bloody exciting time to be a music lover. Between the creative videos by OK Go, the novel, Twilio-powered way of launching a new song by Justin Bieber and, of course, David Bowies surrealist parting blow, theres no shortage of creativity and innovation.You and I is a collection of tracks found in Sony Musics archives, most of them virtually unheard for the past 20 years.In Buckleys new video, the listener can click on various panels of the videos scrolling animation to change the story. Interesting enough on its own, but not all that innovative  Then, about 15 seconds into the video, the creatorskick it up a notch, and start giving the viewer choices about the music itself as well, making it possible to create a remix on the fly, as the track is playing. How very cool, and howvery Jeff Buckley.The listener can choose to create a bare solo performance featuring little more than Buckleys voice, or go all in, with piano accompaniment, full orchestration, and even a backing choir.Dylans song-writing magic means that Just Like a Woman ismulti-layered out the wazoo, and the magic of the interactive video, of course, is that it becomes possible to guide the listener towards one meaning or the other; the fully-orchestrated version sounds profoundly different than the stripped-back vocal version  and all the varieties in between give the listener new ways to hear the song, and new ways of exploring the music.The video will be available as aniOS app as well,and includes an option at the end to create a movie posterposter with all the cell combinations chosen by the user, which can be sharedto your friends. And to your enemies, for that matter.So, are you ready to fall into a music hole for a few hours? Excellent. Grab a beer, and lets go:
