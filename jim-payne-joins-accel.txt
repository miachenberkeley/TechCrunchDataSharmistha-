Jim Payne left day-to-day operations at Twitter nearly a year ago, and now hes ready to work onhis next company.Not that Payne has been twiddling his thumbs since his departure  hes been advising startups and also making plans of his own, for a startup somehow involving mobile video. With todays announcement that hes joining Accel Partners as an entrepreneur in residence, Payne said hes going to start building the initial team while also advising theother startups in Accels portfolio.Payne and Accel have an existing relationship. The venture firm backed his mobile ad startup MoPub, which was acquired by Twitter for more than $350 million(and has become the foundation for the companys efforts to build an ad business beyond Twitter itself). Accel also invested in AdMob, the where Payne was a senior product manager before he starteda company of his own.The goal is just to open up the rolodex and the network to Jim, whos obviously a world-class entrepreneur, said Accel partner Rich Wong. He noted that pretty much every company backed by Accel is either mobile first or is transitioning to mobile, so Payne can help them figure out the monetization side.For his part, Payne said he preferred to incubate the as-yet-unnamed startup within Accel because he didnt want to work in solitude on some ideas.And while Payne isnt ready to revealmuch about the startup, he said the mobile video industry reminds me a lot of where mobile advertising was years ago  there are a lot of opportunities to build infrastructure to solve these problems.
