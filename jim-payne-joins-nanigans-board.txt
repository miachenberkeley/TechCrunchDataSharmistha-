Nanigans is best-known as a Facebook advertising company, but CEO Ric Calvillo said that by adding MoPub founder Jim Payne to its board of directors, it can grow the non-Facebook side of its business.Although Facebooks done so well and we want to continue to be the best advertising automation platform on Facebook, we think theres an opportunity to be a truly independent platform as an alternative to the Facebook and Google stacks, Calvillo said.Henoted that beyond the big online ad platforms, theres an expansive landscape of large and small publishers  in fact, many of the big ad players (including AOL, which owns TechCrunch) are essentially aggregating those publishers for advertisers.Theres going to be a landgrab for all the other publishers, Calvillo predicted. Jim Payne is really going to help us navigate all this inventory into our platform.In fact, Nanigans first move beyond Facebook was adding support for MoPub in 2014.Earlier this year, Nanigans announced that it had raised $24 million in Series B funding. At the time, Calvillo said the company was shifting from an ad-spend focused business model to annual, software-as-a-service contracts.Payne, meanwhile, left his full-time role at Twitter about a year after the companyacquired MoPub. Hes sincejoined the board of ad analytics company Metamarkets and is developing on a new startup while serving as Entrepreneur in Residence at Accel.The Nanigans board alreadyincludes Calvillo, Cheetah Mobile CEO Sheng Fu, Rich Levandov of Avalon Ventures and independent advisor Scott Rafer.
