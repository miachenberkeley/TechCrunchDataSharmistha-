While most of the current Hollywood headlines are focused on the Academy Awards, there were some new movies this weekend, too  including Triple 9, a sprawling crime drama with a cast that includes (deep breath) Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson and future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot.I spoke to director John Hillcoat about the film before its release, as well as the broader direction of the industry. Hillcoats had an interesting career in recent years, directing movies that are neither tiny indies nor big blockbusters  The Road, for example, was a post-apocalyptic drama based on an award-winning novel, with a reported $25 million budgetand Viggo Mortenson in the lead.Hillcoat has described Triple 9 as his attempt to create a fresh, contemporary, urban thriller, sort of an update to classics like The French Connection and Heat. The difference, he told me, is that the stakes are much higher out there on the streets today  a reality he tried to reflect in the film, bringing on advisors from law enforcement and putting real-life gang members on-screen.The police force is more like a military operation now, while the gangs and Latino cartels use virtually terrorist tactics in their neighborhoods, Hillcoat said. Everythings been ramped up.Hillcoat added that like his other films, he wanted Triple 9 to show a very morally murky world where its hard to draw the line between the heroes and villains. However, hes found thats its becomingharder and harder to make to make morally complex films aimed at adults. (Triple 9, by the way,is projected to have anunderhwleming opening weekend.)Actually, film has lost its nerve and given that audience over television, and instead, film is more focused on franchise and spectacle, Hillcoatargued  so perhaps its not surprising that hes looking atTV projects himself, though he said its too early to offer any specifics.Still, he said hes heartened by the box office success of two movies that usually arent mentioned in the same breath The Revenant and of Deadpool. In Hillcoats eyes, theyre two mature audience films that have found a massive audience.To me, thats a good sign, he said.
