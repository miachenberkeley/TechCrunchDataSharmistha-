Some exciting news from the John McAfee camp today: Americasfavorite (and most entertaining) cybersecurity expert has a new gig!MGT Capital Investments(NYSEMKT: MGT),a company that owns and operates social gaming apps, has announced the appointment of John McAfee asExecutive Chairman and CEO. MGT Capital Investments has a market cap of under$10 million and trades on NYSEs small-cap exchange, meaning it is a public company that is for all intents andpurposes privately run.Butbest of all? The company said it will be changing itscorporatename to John McAfee Global Technologies!So what does McAfee get out of this? Im glad you asked! In exchange for his new appointment,MGT Capital InvestmentsJohn McAfee Global Technologies,has entered a definitive asset purchase agreement from D-Vasive, McAfees iPhone app that lets you monitor which internal hardware features are being used by different apps.So, its an acqui-hire!But wait, it gets better! The social gaming startupalso announcedit has entered into a consulting agreement with Future Tense Secure Systems,the cybersecurity company led by none other than John McAfee!So a company hired McAfee, renamed itself after him, bought his startup AND is paying him forconsulting services. Okay.While McAfees compensation isnt being released yet, the company is paying $300,000 and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT stock (about 47 percent of the total company) to McAfees old company, D-Vasive.While the deal will be subject tocustomary closing conditions, including approval by MGTs stockholders, something tells me that this isnt exactly your typical public company with a lot of outstanding stockholders.
