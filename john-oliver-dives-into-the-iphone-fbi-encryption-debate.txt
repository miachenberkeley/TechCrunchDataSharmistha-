If you were hoping that John Oliver would do a deep dive on the iPhone encryption debate: good news. Todays the day.The main topic of this weeks episode of Last Week Tonight was encryption, particularly as it relates to the FBIs demands to be let into an encrypted iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooters.Oliver starts with an oh-so-brief recap of why encryption is important in the first place, then uses historical examples to explain why the idea of forcing Apple to intentionally introduce a backdoor is such a risky one. I wont say too much lest I spoil it, but its definitely worth a watch whether youve been following the topic or not.Come for the refreshingly insightful rant, stay for the never-not-going-to-be-funny auto-correct jokes.
