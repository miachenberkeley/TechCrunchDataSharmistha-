At TechCrunch, we cover the latest in mobile, and its time for us to devote the same intensity to creating new TechCrunch apps on mobile platforms. To accomplish that, we aim to build out a mobile app product dream team. TL;DR: Were hiring!For a lucky few, this is an opportunity to innovate for an incredible audience. Millions of users who care about product development just as much as you do will interact with your work on a daily basis. And this isnt a place where boredom happens. Were a lean, close-knit group looking for people who get excited about wearing multiple hats, so were looking for a wide variety of skills in each role. Plus, the same team will also be developing new products for Engadget. Were on the hunt for four star players to join our existing team: a mobile product manager, two developers, and a UI/UX designer.For all roles, experience in media is a huge plus, and you must be willing and able to work from our San Francisco office. These are full-time positions with generous benefits. If you think youd be a good fit, please drop me a note with your resum or LinkedIn profile, a few work samples youre proud of, and a quick summary of why you think youd be a great addition to our team. We look forward to hearing from you.
