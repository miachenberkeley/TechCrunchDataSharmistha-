Shows over.Cook: Everyone have a great week!TheWeeknds performance has wrapped; everyone is standing in applauseTim is grooving.TheWeekend is singing while blanketed in a red light; the screen behind him is showing the rear view of his head, also blanketed in monochromatic red. Its a damned cool, sort of surreal effect  it feels a bit like a live music video.The Apple special guest section is now standing so we cant see the magic stage performance.It bassd my beard right offHoly shit the bass in here is so intense my facial hair is shaking.Please give it upfor TheWeeknd!its only fitting to celebrate the launch of Music with a performance by one of the hottest artists around todayCook returns to the stage, thanking everyone who worked on Apple MusicWeve rolled into a promo video for Apple Music. Lots of music! Lots of dancing!Eddie confirms the pricing we listed earlier:
 $9.99 for a solo account
 $14.99 for a family account for up to 6 peopleApple Music will launch in over 100 countries on June 30th. There will be a new version of iTunes for Mac and Windows, and he specifically notes a version for Android coming this fallHe tries again. It plays Glory by John Legend/Common. Thats more like it.Play the song from Selma, he asks Siri  it plays Selene, by Imagine Dragons. Wrong song. Whoops.He uses Siri to play Bruce Springsteens Born To Run, but then asks it to do something a bit more complex: Play the top song from May, 1982Music starts playing Joan Jetts I love Rock N RollHe hops into the Connect tab, showing content from Pharrell, Bastille, and Alabama ShakesHe hops into the radio tab of the app, and plays a pre-queued bit of the Beats1 stationEddie hasnt mentioned Apple Musics pricing yet, but heres what weve gleaned from a just-released press release:
 $9.99/mo with a 3 month trial
 $14.99 family planEddie plays a Cuban house party playlist, and starts salsa dancing around the stage. He can move!From there, it offers up human-curated playlist suggestions inspired by the bands/genres you highlighted.He jumps into the For You tab. The first time you open that tab, itll ask for a few genres you like  then for a few specific artists.He jumps from Spoon to Aretha Franklin. He starts in his own Aretha Franklin collection, but tabs an All tab at the top that brings in everything Aretha-related available on Apple MusicHe jumps into Apple Music, and starts playing an album from Spoon. A mini play rolls up along the bottom of the screen; tapping it brings up a more traditional full-screen view. Sliding down hides it away again(Happy birthday Phil. Hurray.)Eddie is gonna give us a demo of Apple Music. But before I start, I want to wish Phil Schiller a happy birthday!Seems a bit like Drake forgot his speech, actually. Hes powering through it.Drake: As Im working tirelessly on this next album, this comes at a perfect time. Given the success of my last mixtape, this really I cant wait to incorporate Apple Music.Drake: We encourage you to spend the time on your body of work, your craft but now it all lives in one simple place. That is Connect.The dream of being a new artist, like myself 5 years ago, has never been more reachable than right nowDrake is sharing an anecdote about how technology changed [his] lifeDrake has taken the stageEddie is demonstrating Pharrels Connect profile; any photos, video, or audio he shares across twitter or facebook or directly to Connect is pulled in to one placeWe wanted to create a place for fans to connect with Artists they love  and were calling it ConnectBeats1 will broadcast from NY, LA, and LondonWe wanted to create a 24/7 radio station, and weve done that with Beats1. As part of this, weve hired Zane Lowe  [a world renowned dj and interviewer]Video about Beats 1 radio station nowThe New tab, meanwhile, has the latest jams sorted by popularity, but also offers up human curated playlistsIn addition to your music, you can search for and stream any music from iTunesApple Music starts with My Music. All of the music youve purchased, and all of the playlists youve created are right hereJimmy isnt getting super specific about how each feature works  but Eddie Cue is now taking the stage, presumably to do just that.Jimmy: Trent Reznow called me up. He says I got it. Lets create the worlds first 24/7 radio station. Broadcast from 3 cities; not based on algorithms, not based on drum beats. A station that only has one master: music itself.. And I said Why do artists always have the craziest ideas that are so hard to execute? But wait a second, thats why were at Apple!Apple Music Connect is a way for fans to follow artists, allowing artists to connect back with them.The most powerful bit of Music might be its support for smaller artists, mix tapes and more alongside big artists.Beats1, a 24/7 worldwide radio stationAn offscreen voice (which turns out to be trent reznor) narrates the intent of Apple Music: everything from your musical world in 1 placeWere cutting to a videoSo I said .. can we build an ecosystem the way only Apple can? One complete thought around musicBut now, in 2015, the music industry is a fragmented mess. Want to stream music? Go over here. Want to stream video? Go somewhere else. Want to follow some artists? Theres somewhere else for thatJimmy is telling a story about the first time he ever saw iTunes: Wow.. The ads are real. These guys really dothink different.Iovine calls technology the great invader from the northIf you recall, Jimmy came to Apple as part of the Beats acquisitionCook introduces Jimmy Iovine to the stageIt ends with a slide: 2015:MUSICThe video cuts from scene to scene, each showing music across the generations. A record on a turntable, the buttons of a jukebox being pressedAaaand its video time againCook: We love music. Music is such an important part of our lives, and our culture.Here comes Music.And before we close this morning, we do have.. One more thingHes wrapping up everything weve seen today across the three platforms: OS , iOS, and watchOSCook has returned to the stageThe developer beta of watchOS 2 will be available today. Itll be available as a free upgrade to everyone in Fall.He jumps over to the Vine glance to demonstrate short-form video playback. Youre not going to be watching Netflix on the watch, but itll work for things like Vine or Instagram. No word yet on how, specifically, its limited.Hes demonstrating a native volkswagen app, wired up to his car. It opens quickly, and hes able to control the cars thermostat via the digital crownKevin Lynch appears to be using Apple Watchs imaginary diagnostic port to stream the display live. We first reported on the port before the Watch was released back in March.He demonstrates the creation of a singe photo watch face. He opens a photo within the on-watch photos app; he does a hard press on the photo, and taps a Make a watch face button that pops up. Tada! New watch face.Developers will also be able to utilize the taptic engine to subtle communicate with the user, and access the digital crown to have it control the interface however they see fit (as opposed to being forced to use it for scrolling)HealthKit is accessible to Apple Watch apps, including streaming heart rate data. This was something I was asking for a few weeks ago when I monitored a loved ones tachychardic heart episode.Youll be able to access accelerometer data, to do things like measure golf swingsNew native Apple Watch apps run wholly on the Watch. Which means Watch can use WiFi to work without an iPhone. Nibbling away at the cord attaching Watch to phone.We knew you wanted to play back video  you can do that, by playing back short-form videos right on the watch face.Weve heard lots of feature requests, for things you wanted to do with the watch. You wanted to access the microphone on the watch  with watchOS 2, you can do that. We heard you wanted to play audio through the watchs speaker, you can do that.Now, on to the stuff weve built for developers, Out of the gate, you could build apps for the watch with something called WatchKit. These apps today rely on your phone. With Native apps, this logic moves over to the watch.Siri will be able to launch glances now, with commands like Siri, show me the Instagram glanceApple begins executing on making the Apple Watch a remote control for real life.Those third-party complications, by the way, are easily the best thing about the new watchOS. Most of your time using the watch is spent on the face.And, in sync with iOS new Apple Pay rewards/loyalty program support, the watch is getting support for things like Walgreens or Dunkin Donuts perks via WalletThe Watch is now getting health/fitness achievements, for some reason.Siri can now start workouts, so you can say things like Siri, start a 30 minute workout or Siri, I want to go on a 300 calorie bike rideYoull also be able to make Facetime Audio calls from your Apple WatchApples Time Travel feature scoops up the core of the Pebble Time interface.You know those little doodles you can send to friends from the Apple Watch face? You can draw with multiple colors now! Yay!Time Travel allows you to use the digital crown to rewind/fast forward the information presented in these complications, where available. Want to see what the games score was 30 minutes ago? Just rewind a bit.App developers can now make their own Apple Watch complications, which is going to be great. Fantastical, MLB, HomeKit hardware and other items right on your watch face is huge.(Complications are the things you can add to your watch face, which traditionally includes things like weather or moon phases. With this, devs will be able to add things like flight details, or sports scores)With watchOS 2, third party devs will be able to make their own complicationsTime-lapse faces, which show time-relevant time lapses from places like London, Shanghai, and New York.Timepiece (the Watchs watch) will be getting some new watch faces:
 Photo Face (a face made from a single photo)
 Photo Album Face (a face made from an album)First up: Timepiece.A native software development kit for the watch means deeper access to its hardware.To tell you all about it, Id like to invite up my friend Kevin LynchWe started selling the Apple Watch just 6 weeks ago; today, were already talking about the next version of the watchOSFor us, this is a giant moment. This is how we felt when we launched the App Store. Opening a new platform for developers to create applications that can really change peoples lives. We really believe in this space; we believe in technology created for the rest. We believe that by opening up the platform, youll create new and powerful uses that today we can only imagineApple officially names watchOS (a change of case and spacing).Now, we want to talk about the next opportunity the change the world: the opportunity to bring native apps to the watchCook: On behalf of everyone at Apple, wed like to thank the developer community for everything youve done850 apps are downloaded every secondRandom tidbit from the video: the average person has 119 apps.The video cuts from person, all discussing how big and transformative the App Store has been. Plenty of people like Neil Degrasse Tyson (!) and JJ Abrams, alongside educators and developersVideo time!Tim: We could not be more proud of the work that youre doing so weve made a video about your incredible impact.Apple has now paid out $30B to developersUnderpinning all of this, the App Store is very key. Its hard to remember a day without the App Store. Im happy to announce the App Story recently passed a major milestone: 100 billion app downloadsLets hope Swift 2 gets open sourced faster than Facetime, which never did. Complications related to codecs and transport technology caused issues there. Hard to imagine same will happen with Swift.Cook has returned to the stage, and is recapping some of what we saw todayiOS 9 will work on all devices supported by iOS 8 (list incoming)iOS 9 Developer Beta is coming today. A public beta (the first one for iOS) is coming in July. Itll come as a free upgrade in the fallBig, big applause on that one.The crowd goes bananas.We think Swift should be available to everyone.. and today, were announcing that Swift  is going open sourceHes blazing right through the Swift 2 stuff, but itll feature things like mutability warnings, faster debugging, and shorter compilation timesNext up: Swift 2CarPlay is going wireless  youll be able to leave your phone in your backpack, and CarPlay will still work.Apple adding reproductive health, which would enable period tracking, to HealthKit is a really nice addition. Apple was criticized for not offering reproductive data as a part of HealthKits original set of features.With iOS 9, Homekit will get support for Window Shades, Security systems, and more  and its getting remote accessibility via iCloud, allowing you to control your HomeKit devices on the goNext up: HomekitTheyve got all sorts of new fun things for the devs, including ReplayKit  a framework for recording and sharing gameplay videos.Craig is quickly covering some of the performance enhancements: massive battery improvements, all while the OS filesize itself shrinks. iOS 8 was a 4.6 GB, iOS 9 will be 1.3 GBSplit view is only available on iPad Air 2The best news[as a developer]:If youve adopted auto layout, this will all just workHe can drag the picture-in-picture video around the screen, resizing it with a pinch zoom. Its really damned pretty.Apple introduces a revolutionary new iPad technology for the summer of 1988: PIPHe brings up a video within the ESPN app. An email comes in. He taps the notification, which opens the Mail app  but the ESPN video goes picture-in-picture, and continues to playHe has a note open on the right side of the screen; he taps a Map link within it. It opens within the maps app on the left side of the screenOn the left, hes running safari; on the right, notes. Each is running fully independently.He swipes down from above on the Messages view, and is able to switch just that one app independentlyCraig is demonstrating the split screen view. Hes in Safari, but swipes from the right side of the screen  a view of the messages app slides into place.By turning iPads keyboard into a trackpad and launched split screen apps. Finally differentiating iPad from iPhone definitively.Next up: split view multitaskingThe iPad also has deeper support for hardware keyboards now  things like command tabs are now supportedApple just turned the iPads keyboard into a trackpad.If you put two fingers on the keyboard, it now becomes a trackpad that can control the cursor.Swipe to the left with two fingers, and the cursor will move accordinglyTheyve added cut/copy/paste and formatting shortcuts above the keyboardFirst up: a quicktype keyboard.For many, the iPad is the primary computerNews has implications for Facebooks Instant Article and Flipboard, obviously. Twitter (or another suitor) may finally get the price theyve been looking for there.Next, lets turn to iPadIn line with Apples recent focus on Privacy, nothing from the News app is shared with third parties, and a list of what you read isnt pushed back to the mothershipShe searches for swift, and it offers up two categories: Taylor Swift, and Apples Swift programming language. Articles are properly sorted into each category, so youre not reading about Taytays latest drama when all you want is code news.Tap the explore tab on the bottom, and itll offer up publishers and topics it thinks you might likeYou hop from article to article by swiping. Shes demonstrating a few articles built with the new Apple News format in mind. It supports image galleries, inline videos, and more.The articles can come from anywhere, but the best are built in our new Apple News formatFrom those subscriptions, it creates a feed called For You.When you first launch it, it offers up things like Time, Wired, BuzzFeed, DaringFireball, and more as quick subscriptionsThe first thing News wants to do is get a sense of what you likeWere hopping into a demo of News nowHere is Apples Flipboard/Facebook Instant competitor: News. Likely built by Prss team.Today, Im pleased to announce a new application: NewsApple is shipping transit in two countries first. The US andsurpriseChina. China is incredibly important to Apples business going forward.Itll support step-by-step directions for getting from point A to point B by public transit. Itll even tell you how to get around within many popular transit hubs, which is hugeSome of us have been waiting a very long time for Apple to just rename Passbook to Wallet. Apple, unlike Google, went the way of building trust first before offering people a holistic wallet on their smartphone. Time will tell if it pays off, but it demonstrates the difference in their approaches here.And as long rumored: this Maps update is focusing on Public TransitUsage of the built-in maps is 3.5x higher than the next most popular mapping app (which, presumably, means Google Maps)Next up: MapsYou can also sketch within NotesYou can now build checklists within the Notes app (which pretty much everyone does manually already)Notes now supports formatting, for things like heads and increased font sizesFirst up: NotesCraig has retaken the stage. Lets talk about the apps you use mostAs a result of the focus expansion, Passbook is being renamed WalletApple pay offering rewards and loyalty cards is huge, btw. If youre not familiar with the payments space, loyalty cards are huge drivers of return traffic to stores and have been a big ask for merchants.Also rewards cards/loyalty programs from places like Walgreens, and Dunkin DonutsComing next to Apple Pay: store cards. Places like JC Penney, and KohlsJennifer Bailey, Apple Pay chief, is a woman which is making waves in the commentary as women on Apples stage are a rarity.Commuters will be able to pay fares on the London transportation system using Apple PayApple Pay is coming to the UK next monthWith the grand momentum of Apple Pay, were excited to announce that were bringing Apple Pay to the UKLater this month, Pinterest will launch buyable Pins. Youll be able to buy from popular retailers using Apple Pay, and only under iOSWere also excited to be working with PinterestSquare is launching a new reader this fall to allow small businesses to accept Apple PayApple Pay will get Discover card support this fallJennifer Bailey, head of Apple Pay, has taken the stageYep. Our assumptions about how Apple would execute on this (locally) is correct.Next up: Apple PayAll of the proactive/intelligence data is anonymous, not linked to your AppleID, and not shared with third partiesWe do it in a way that does not compromise your privacywe honestly just dont want to know. All of this is done on device.  FederighiiOS 9s calendar system now accounts for things like traffic with its alertsLube, naked butts and poutine. WWDC ladies and gents.The dad jokes are flying fast and thick now.He needs to convert some of the ingredients from the recipe  fortunately, spotlight can now do that. He types 12 tbsp; it auto converts to 3/4 cupHe swipes over to the search screen, pictured below. He searches for Potatoes; it offers up recipes from a third party app, Yumly.If the Proactive Assistant uses data on your local device inside your apps  but doesnt use that data for anything else  that could be the way that Apple does what Google Now or Cortana does without giving up sole ownership of data.He receives an invite to a karaoke party; Proactive recognizes this as an invite, and automatically throws it into his calendarCraig demonstrates some of the new context-sensitive features. He pops into a message from Phil Schiller. He says Remind me about this later today; when Siri reminds him later, itll know to jump right into that message.iOS now has an API for search, allowing it to find content  like, say, an airBNB that youve reserved  within 3rd party apps. These search results are deeplinked within the app, so clicking them will open up the relevant app in the appropriate place (like on the AirBNB listing page)When you swipe to the left from the homescreen, itll now offer up a list of the people you contact most, or the apps that you tend to use around this time of day.Apple says Siri is context sensitive, drawing information from a variety of your devices and applications. Context awareness across the board requires personal data, but as I mentioned when talking about Apple and privacy, their goal will be to do it locally within a users devices and maybe their secure personal cloud.The dialer app will now be able to identify phone numbers, but in a curious way: it recognizes phone numbers from your emailsSiri also has some degree of context sensitivity; you can now say Remind me about this when I get home to Siri while looking at a page, and it knows youre referring to that page.Remember Tim Cooks comments on privacy a week ago? Craig is now talking about the intelligence of Siri  which is reliant on data being given to it. How Apple executes on that intelligence will be their differentiating factor.Here, like with OS X, you can use natural language in your searches. You can say things to Siri like Show me my photos from last julySince last year, Siri has gotten 40% faster in its response timesImprovements in those 4 areas are what Apple is all about with iOS 9. This is not going to be a ton of new features update.But they also wanted to improve the intelligence of the OS, improve the built-in apps, and improve the iPad experienceWe wanted to elevate the foundations of the platform; things like extending your battery life, performance, and security.Craig: Tucked, btw.Were now looking forward to iOS 983% of active iPhone users are on iOS 8Federighi now setting up iOS 9 being a maintenance update as well.Next up: iOSItll go into public beta in July, And will be available as a free upgrade for all this FallOS X El Capitan will go into developer preview todayApple is already done talking about El Capitain  which means that its really, really great that its being offered for free. IYKWIMCraig mentions a few other devs who are working with metal already: 2k, unity, blizzard, unreal, and others.The game is quite pretty  lots of particle effects, tons of realtime lighting effects, and complex objects being tossed around the screen.Its Fortnite GregTheyre demonstrating an in-editor view of an upcoming Epic game, Fortnite*.Metal brings a 10x rendering performance, which is important for games. To demonstrate this, theyve partnered with Epic Games, who has taken the stage.What weve seen from working with early pro developers is incredible. Craig mentions that Adobe was able to increase performance in After Effects by 8x.Metal is Apples framework for running complex graphical code as close to the hardware (or the metal) as possibleThis year, were bringing Metal to the MacNext up: OS Xs performance. Weve optimized performance throughout the OS. App switching is 2x faster, opening mail is 2x faster, and opening a PDF is 4x as fastIf youre running multiple Desktops/Spaces, Mission Control now handles everything intelligently. For example, dropping a currently running app into a desktop that is currently full screen will automatically establish a split-screen viewSplitscreen browsing windows which snap to one another telegraphs possible splitscreen on iPad.You can now drag an app to one side of the screen to automatically snap it to that edgeNatural language support within Mail (and likely all native apps) means speaking to OS X like a human. The future.OS X seems to be getting system-wide level natural language search. You can run a search for something like Show me all the mail I ignored from phil as a search query, and itll parse it properly.Not that these arent nice features! But there will likely be a lot of other stuff to fill time if were already this far deep into El Cap.The applause for the browser-wide muting of audio has gotten the biggest applause so far. Its very fiddly stuff right off the bat.Spotlights search window can now be resized/moved around. Thats innovation for you, Craig jokes.Tabs will also have audio/music indicators, a la Chrome, allowing you to figure out which Tab is blaring audio at you. He demonstrates this with a not-so-subtle RickrollYou can now pin sites within Safari; pinned sites open with Safari, and seem to be preloaded. They stick to the left of tabs as new tabs open.Hes popping into Mail. Messages can be swiped around within Mail to be deleted/marked as new, Mailbox style.The fact that weve jumped right into demoing refinements and gesture updates also indicates that refinement is the theme of this version of OS X.Craig Highlights three improvements to OS X Yosemite with El Capitan: Spotlight, Built-in apps, and window management.So we were right on that call. El Capitain, a mountain inside of Yosemite, signals that this update will be a refinement of OS X Yosemite, rather than a complete revamp.The new name for the next OS X: OS X El CapitanWeve got naked butts.We started with a product naming meeting *cut to a shot of a bunch of product managers sitting in a hot tub*Now were gonna get a name for the new OS XCraig Federighi is out to tout OS X. Big laughs in the audience at a slide showing Windows 10 at very low adoption.The adoption rate for Yosemite is at 55% of active mac users in just 8 months after release.Were gonna start today with OS XCraig Federighi has taken the stage; the audience, again, goes crazyWow, Cook skips over the usual updates on how Apple is doing to get right to it. This must be packed.The original team note, btw, had some lube on it, no word on Apple giving them lube. (Apple has edited the lube out of the one shown on stage, likely to avoid their CEO floating in front of the phrase 50 gallon tub of lube.)Hes running down the agenda of what were talking about today: first OS X, then iOS, then native apps on Apple Watchs watchOSCook delivers an anecdote about the Cleveland Indians holding Brandon Moss home run ball hostage for a bunch of Apple products. So Apple gives them a bunch of stuff to get the ball back.Tim mentions that 350 people in the audience are students here on a scholarship  the youngest of which is just 12 years old.While we dont have any highflying trapeze acts, we have a lot to talk about this morningLots of clapping in the audience as Cook walks out on stage after that very long opening skit.Welcome to San Francisco! Welcome to WWDC 2015!!TimCook has taken the stageA big musical number with Dani Pudi singing about the App Store. This is a first for sure.Youre an Angel Investor, you make millions off of kids dreamsNow Hader is in an elevator full of Tim Cook lookalikes.Weve got a tinder swiping joke.
