Hello, friendly folks. We are planning on holding a mini-meetup in Barcelona during MWC, offering you guys a chance to pitch TC writers and potentially hold a pitch-off for free tickets to Disrupt New York. We need your help.Since this is an ad hoc thing, well need a little assistance in choosing a venue and potentially a drinks sponsor. I have heard good things about El Nacional but you can recommend other open, neutral spaces, preferably not a co-working space or office.Things are still in the planning stage but we will hold the event on Tuesday, March 3 in the evening. If youd like to help with planning please email me at john@techcrunch.com or Skype me at johnnybnyc. Sponsors would be responsible for an hour of bar time. Well post an RSVP list and pitch-off application shortly.Hope to see you in Barcelona!
