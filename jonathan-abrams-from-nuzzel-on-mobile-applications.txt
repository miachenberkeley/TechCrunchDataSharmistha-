Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. It was great to speak with Jonathan Abrams of Nuzzel this week. He claims to bea simple engineer, not into VC-style pontificating  but he does have some deep thoughts toshare on the future of content, and where Nuzzel fits into it. Jonathan is aninternet OG: from Netscape through Friendster to angel investments, and is fullof insights.While it is tempting to get onto the latest technology (VR, AR, drones etc.), theprofound secular shift to mobile Internet still has consequences that must bedealt with.One of these consequences is a complete overload of content. The cloud makescontent generation cheaper by the day, social media makes it easier and easier toshare that content and mobile gives you access to it 24 hours a day  oftenpushed right into your face.The problem now is not finding content, it is findingthe right content and hiding from the wrong. This is what companies like Nuzzelhope to offer: curation as a service, putting a filter on the great fire-hose ofcontent, and the opportunityfor context rather than just more news.To install a free app should be no barrier to entry at all, but in a world wherecontent is not scarce, attention is. Consumers standing in front of the content fire-hose want to save their attention for chosen sources, and getting a place on thephone screen is more and more difficult.
