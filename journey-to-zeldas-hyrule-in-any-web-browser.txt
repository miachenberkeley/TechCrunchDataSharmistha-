The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was a technical feat on a home console back in 1991 when it was launched, but today a team has brought the entire overworld map from the game to your browserusing only HTML5. Thanks to the team behind JADSDS engine, you can now navigate to Hyrule from any device, includingyour iPhone or iPad, and check out a scrollable version of the map from the game complete with environment and NPC animations.Its an impressive demo of their JavaScript animator tech for web developers, but its also awesome even if you have no interest in the nuts and bolts behind the tech. Theres something very nostalgic about being able to zoom out and take a good look at the animated Hyrule map from a birds eye view right in Safari or Chrome.If youre having trouble loading the page, just keep trying; the site seems to be under heavy load currently.Via The Verge
