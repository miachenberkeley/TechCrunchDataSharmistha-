June,a countertop smart oven designed by former Google, Apple and GoPro employeeshas closed a Series A round of financing for $22.5 million today, led by early stage combination hardware and software investor Eclipse.Previous investors also participated in this round, includingFoundry Group, First Round Capital, and Lerer Hippeau Ventures.June is sort of like an easy-bake oven for grown-ups, albeitwith a much more adult-sized $1500 price tag. The cost of the device may be justifiable for those who dont like to cook, however. The oven willbasically make your meal for you at the perfect temperature without you doing anything more than pressing OK.Juneincludes a built-in camera and processor to identify the foods you put inside to cook them at the recommended settings and connects to alive streaming app so you cancheck in on the process.The startup planned to start sending out its first batch of products this spring. However,a bump in manufacturing and some upgrades has delayed shipping and the new release date is now slated forcloser to the Holiday season, according to a company statement:First, weve redesigned the heating architecture, allowing the oven to provide more even heat distribution,better broiling and significantly improving its baking performance.Second, weve decided to work with new manufacturing partners for plastics and cosmetic sheet metal;finding the right manufacturing partners is critical to ensure great product quality. We have now finalized andlocked in our supply chain partners, with whom we plan to work all the way through shipping.We had to make a hard choice between a summer shipment and the best shipment, and we chose to shipthe best possible oven. We hope youll agree that it was the right call.This obviously didntscare off investors and June says the new funding will allow it to continue hiring and building the team as well as work towards delivering the first batch on the new intended timeframe.June says it will also refund pre-orders for those upset with the delay by emailingsupport.In the meantime, June will continue beta testing the product and says it has about 100 ovens to send out into the wild for that purpose.
