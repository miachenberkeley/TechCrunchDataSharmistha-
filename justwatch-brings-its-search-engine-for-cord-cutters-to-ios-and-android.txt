JustWatch, a startup that launched earlier this year offering a search engine that helpscord cutters figure out where to watch their favorite programs and movies, is nowexpanding to mobile. The companyhas released both iOS and Android applications that help you find where to watch movies and shows, as well as discover new and popular content across a variety of services, including Netflix, Amazon, HBO NOW, Showtime, Hulu, iTunes and many others.While there are a good handful of apps and sites available todaythat offer similar solutions to JustWatch, such as Fan TV,Yidio, Instantwatcher,CanIStreamIt, and more, JustWatch has been differentiating itself by focusing on both the U.S. and international audiences. Following its launch this February, which was U.S. only to start, the company broadened its search engine to support Germany, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. And inthe near future, JustWatch is expanding to Canada and the U.K., the company tells us.Online, the service works as a search engine where you can enter in a title and find out where you can stream it or buy it, and which service currently has the best price. The site also features regular updates that alert you to new content arriving on your favorite service. This is especially helpful for those who primarily use just one or two streaming services, and get to the point where they feel like theyve already watched everything good that fits their interests, for example.The new mobile appout nowoffers a similar feature set, andwill also highlight shows and movies that are trending with users across services. At launch, JustWatch is tracking Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, HBO NOW, Showtime, Hulu, Crackle, iTunes, Vudu, Xbox, PlayStation, Epix, and select niche offerings like realeyz, Mubi and Fandor.As noted above, there are a number of apps that help you track the streaming and download landscape, but Ive found JustWatchs simplified interface and its selection of search filters to be quite useful.For example, you can identify where individual seasons of a show can be found  which is handy because current shows often have only some seasons or episodes availableon streaming services, while more recent seasons might only be available as paid downloads.You can also filter shows and moviesby whether theyre available for streaming or purchase, the best price, HD or SD format, and you can drill down on individual TV show episodes tosee the same info for just asingle title. From the filters option by the apps main search box, you can also filter by movie or TV, genre, release year, and quality (HD or SD).In addition, JustWatch lets you add favorites to a universalWatchlist, and from here you can click on the provider to start streaming immediately. This works both online and on mobile.The new apps price drop feature, meanwhile, lets you keep track of sales. In a timeline-like interface, the app will display movies and shows that are available for rent or purchase, the old and new price, and the percentage discount. From here, youcan tap on any title to be directed to the service andbuy the video.Unfortunately, I did find some glitches with regard to JustWatchs content database. For example, the AMC show Humans, which is trending right now, is actually available for purchase on both iTunes and Amazon Instant Video (not Prime Instant Video). However, JustWatch failed to pick this up, only pointing to Vudu and PlayStation as places you could watch. The lack of the Amazon link may have to do with issues related to the Amazon feed.JustWatch CEO David Croy explains that theyve split Amazon Prime Instant Video and Amazon Instant Video into two providers for filtering purposes, but the feeds data quality is one of the worst worldwide, and they often have trouble with it. However,its unclear why JustWatch ismissing the iTunes link Croy basically chalks this up to a bug.Also, because JustWatch hasnt expanded to include some of the more niche streaming services, you might be missing other deals and relevant information. As another example, CBSs popular show Big Bang Theory is sold on Amazon Instant Video and is available through CBSs servicefor cord cutters, CBS All Access. But JustWatch will only point to iTunes, Vudu and PlayStation.In other words, the app is a good first step in finding content, but its not necessarily a perfect solution at this point in time. But then again, based on tests with JustWatchscompetitors, none of them are just yet.Instead of charging for its service,Croy saysthat the companys business model will focus on ad campaigns from movie studios who willtarget JustWatch users.The first campaigns are already booked and running and are showing a huge uplift in trailer view performance on YouTube and Facebook, because our targeting is already really efficient and cuts off a lot of the normal waste coverage that comes with interest and demographic targeting, saysCroy.The JustWatch mobile app is a free download on Google Play and the iTunes App Store.(The company had toyed with making it a paid download during testing, but has decided to keep it free.)
