More people than ever are cutting their ties to big cable, and opting to either cut the cord, or just dramatically pare down their cable TV packages. According to Nielsens data, the top 40 cable channels have lost an average of 3.2 million subscribers over the past four years. That leaves room for startups catering to the needs of these viewers,who have either replaced or now heavily supplement their traditional TV viewing with streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video.Case in point: a new service called JustWatch, launching today, wants to become a resourcefor these viewers, by offering a streaming search engine designed just for cord cutters.The startup isfocused on serving an international crowd of cord cutters, including, but not limited to, the U.S. It will soon begin supporting audiences in Germany and Brazil, following its U.S. debut.The idea, explains co-founder and CEODavid Croy, is to help people figure out where to watch a movie or show without having to log into every service provider youre using and perform a search. With JustWatch, the search engine shows you whether a piece of content is available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, or elsewhere. And if its available for rent, it lets you know where you can get it for the best price.In addition, JustWatchincludes a feature that heavy streaming mediaconsumers will appreciate: it updates every day to let you know if your favorite provider has added new content. (For now, this feature is limited to movies, but will expand in time.)I was missing that feature myself on existing streaming aggregators, after I had the feeling Id already seen everything I wanted to watch on each provider, explains Croy.Users can also take advantage of the search engines filters in order to drill down into selections by year, genre, and soon, ratings, as sourced by sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB.The company is working to roll out its own native applications, too,were told.The idea of offering a service for cord cutters, or those who just want to know when and where streaming content can be found, is not unique, of course.Today, many cord cutters and others use services like Yidio, Instantwatcher and CanIStreamIt, all of which offer similar features, and are further developed in many cases. But JustWatchs vision is to build the biggest user base around movie and TV taste profiles worldwide, as opposed to stateside, likesome of its competitors.Eventually, the companys plan is help movie studios retarget film fans viaJustWatchsown integrated adtech using programmatic and real-time bidding.The cord cutting trend is a big problem for the movie industry, because Hollywood is still spending more than 70% of their budgets on linear tv, but the young movie audience who is responsible for the biggest chunk of the box office is spending a lot more time online  for example,on YouTube and Facebook  and this trend is accelerating rapidly, saysCroy.So the movie industry will have to follow the eyeballs mobile and online and try to find their target audience for new movie releases in a fragmented online and mobile world, he adds.Early tests of the services targeting algorithms showed a 106% better click-through rate on movie banners, and 46% better user engagement in terms of trailer views and time on site, the company claims.Croy, who previously served as CMO at European mobile coupons servicekaufDA, founded JustWatch along with a small team whose background includes time at adtech company Trademob, streaming site MyVideo, as well as kaufDA. The service is self-funded with moneyCroy reinvested following the kaufDA exitto German publishing house Axel Springer.JustWatch, now a team of ten, is based in Berlin.For more on cord-cutting, follow along with my diary of a cord cutter in 2015.
