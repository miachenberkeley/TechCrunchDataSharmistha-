Theres been a very big shift in the thinking of many online publishers, according to JW Player President Chris Mahl. Yes, many of them are looking at Facebook and YouTube as platforms where they can build awareness, but he argued that theyre really concentrating on driving traffic on their own sites.Thats where you as the publisher have complete and total control over how your audience engages with your content that youre spending so much time and money on, added CEO Dave Otten. You also probably have complete control over the monetization.Naturally, itsa trend that JW Player (maker of the video player of the same name) would like to see continue, and it seems tobe reflected in the companys growth  it added more than 4,500 software-as-a-service customers and doubled revenue in the past year, and it now reaches more than 1 billion unique viewers in a single month. Its also announcing that it has raised $20 million in Series D funding.The round follows a Series C of the same size from 2014, and it comes from existing investors, including Greycroft Growth, Greenspring Associates, Cueball Capital and e.ventures.JW Player is working to buildmore tools on top of the basicplayer. Otten said the company no longer sees itself as just a technology provider for publishers: Were very much shifting to being an audience and monetization partner, a business growth partner.The company is also building more tools for developers. It launched its software development kit for Android apps last year, with plans to add support for apps on Internet-connected TVs early this year.And its planning for global growth. Mahl said that while 40 percent of JW Players publishers are outside the United States, the company has remain concentrated in New York. Thatll change this year, with new offices in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
