Buzzy live streaming video app du jour Meerkat, which makes it super easy to live stream video to your Twitter followers (and has just pulled in $12M from Greylock at a $40M valuation), does include an option to save your video once youve killed the stream  but hey, in the slick environs offrictionless social broadcasting who has time for after-the-fact uploading?So heres Katch*to take the incremental strain out of your post-Meerkat experience via a hashtag-triggered auto-upload. (*not to be confused with ad-targeting ecommerce SaaS Katch.com)Add #Katch to your Meerkat video description tweet and the service will record and upload the live stream to YouTube, tweeting you a link to the video once its done processing  like so (below)  and adding to the tally of badly framed videos on YouTube:|REPLAY| Live Kat #Katch test #meerkat @riptari http://t.co/Au2lhOiFBu #katch (@katchkats) March 22, 2015You dont even have to download a Katch app to work this automagic  its all done by hashtag.We can but dream that one day allthings will be so trivially achievable.#fame #wealth #happinessKatch, which bills itself as the record button for Meerkat  and touts the frankly eye-bleeding notionthat you never have to miss another Meerkat is the work of Tarikh Korula, who also co-founded hashtag ranking serviceSeen.co, which promises to filter signal from social noise via its SeenRank algorithm (which figuresout which topic-based media is getting the most eyeballs so you dont have to).Korula has also been known to take to thestageas TCs hackmasterat ourDisrupt New York hackathon.Katch is currently topping product discovery service Product Hunts daily leaderboard with 56 upvotes, and someenthusiastic comments from Product Hunt co-founder Ryan Hoover  who notes its anotherexample of an invisible app  a product that doesnt have its own interface, integrated within peoples existing workflow. Or tl:dr #simples.Also impressed by this modestMeerkat hack: Meerkats very own co-founder and CEO Ben Rubin  whogave it his emoji-blessing yesterdayOMG SO COOL http://t.co/KepY67F0bX cc @katchkats  Ben Rubin (@benrbn) March 21, 2015One other thing to note is its (currently) possible to #Katchother peoples Meerkat streams  by adding the hashtag to a retweet of another personsMeerkat LIVE NOW tweet. Doing so canrecord and upload someone elses streamto YouTube without their say-so. Which may well raise some hackles.Weve put some questions toKorula about his intentions with Katch and will update this post with any response.and hes calling the projecta proof of concept at this nascent stage.We were spelunking the undocumented API on Tuesday and riffing on some ideas for features we might hack. The plan was to build a feature that we wanted and see if anyone else did too. We wanted to match the delightfulness of the [Meerkat] app with a simple and delightful implementation. We brainstormed some more on Wednesday and started building on Thursday we finished lateFriday night and people found it and started using it on Saturday, he says, explaining the dev process.In terms of where theyre planning to take Katch, he says the team has ideas for more features to add if it seems like the community wants them.One example of extending Katchs functionality might be to allow users to log in so they can manage the content theyve auto-uploaded to YouTube after the fact.On katching others content,Korula says that after initially enabling this they aretweaking itso its not such a free-for-all. After chatting with some early users were dialing it back so users can request a #katch to a broadcaster, but the broadcaster has the ultimate right to decide, he adds.
