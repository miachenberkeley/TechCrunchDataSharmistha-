It canthen ship you a key when you want a copy, or you canhave one printed instantly at a kiosk pretty handy if you get locked out.KeyMe doesntjust copy regular house keys, but also car keys with transponder chips.Founder and CEO Greg Marsh said his goal is disrupting the locksmith industry by creating a key duplication service thats more convenient, more affordable and even more accurate than existing services.Apparentlyone of the biggest sources of mistakes when humans copy keys is choosing the correctblank key to start with.You havethese very subtle differences that distinguish all these thousands of key types, makingit very hard for a person to correctly classify keys, he said.In contrast,KeyMe relies on artificial intelligence and neural networks to perform this classification. As a result, Marsh said that traditional locksmiths might have an error rate of 15 to 20 percent,while KeyMes error rate is a single digit percent.KeyMe copies can also be personalized. As for security, KeyMe kiosks require a fingerprint scan before you can unlock saved copies of your keys.KeyMe previously raised $2.3 million in seed fundingand a $7.8 million Series A.The new roundwas led by Comcast Ventures, with additional investmentfrom Battery Ventures, White Star Capital, 7-Ventures (the venture arm of 7-Eleven), Ravin Gandhi, Coinstar founder Jens Molbak, The Michael Polsky Family Office and others.Board member and WhiteStar managing partner Christian Hernandeznoted that his firm has doubled down multiple times on KeyMe. Pointing to the excitement from retailers and the size of the $7.5 billion locksmith industry, Hernandez said investing in the current round was actually one of the easiest conversations Ive ever had.Marsh, meanwhile, suggested that KeyMe has big plans for growth.For example, he said the company currently has around 100 in-store kiosks across the United States, but the plan is to ship 1,000 new kiosks this year and 10,000 new kiosks in the next 36 months.
