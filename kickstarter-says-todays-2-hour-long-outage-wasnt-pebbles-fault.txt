Kickstarter says that the roughlytwo-hour-long outage that took place todaywas unrelated to the massive traffic sent to its service by those backing the Pebble smartwatchs latest, and nowrecord-breaking, campaign. According to a company spokesperson, it was only a coincidence that the Kickstarter website went down today, even though yesterday was one of the companys biggest traffic days ever, they noted.The company first publicly acknowledged the site issues around noon Eastern today via a tweet, after a number of users took to Twitter to complain about the popular crowdfunding site being unresponsive, and showing a 503 Service Unavailable page uponvisiting the Kickstarter.com domain.Is @kickstarter down? pic.twitter.com/Kd3e1Uf22s Joey Banks (@joeyabanks) February 25, 2015The most popular theory we saw, which some news outlets, including CNBC, even hinted at, was that the service buckled under the load of traffic that Pebble backers sent the site over the past day.Did  did Kickstarter get slashdotted? Wil Wheaton (@wilw) February 25, 2015In case you missed it  the smartwatch maker Pebble returned to Kickstarter on Tuesday to run a crowdfunding campaign for its new hardware, the Pebble Time, a thinner and lighter version of its flagship smartwatch which features a color e-ink screen, better power consumption, voice control, and a bigger focus on notifications over apps.To say that the new watch was met with an enthusiastic response would be an understatement.The Pebble hit its $500,000 funding goal within just 17 minutes. Nine hours after the launch of the campaign,ithad raised $6.5 million, earning it a spot in the top 5 most funded projects. And its worth pointing out that those campaigns thatpulled in more funding did so overa month or longer  not in under a day, as Pebble did.Today, as ofthe time of writing, Pebble has climbed to $9.3 million in crowdfunding, andthe numbers are still inching upwards.Kickstarters site returned to normal operationsshortly after 2 PM EST, according to another company tweetas well as the Kickstarter status page.The company is currently declining to detail the nature of the outage, saying that engineers are still heads down, only noting that it was unrelated to the Pebble campaign. Performance on Tuesday, amid the flood of traffic, had remained steady, were told.Kickstarter sometimes does post mortems on its engineering blogwhen things like this occur, but its not yet clear if it will do so today. If and when more details are provided, well update here.
