There may be tens of thousands of developers already building bots for Messenger, but Livingston believes that Kik is better situated to host bots that people will actually use.Livingston sees the current, more text-based, approach to chatbots as something similarto the way companies were approaching websites in 1996. He believesthat soonplatforms will see the full bot potential and put more effort into givingdevs tools to createmore streamlined experiences for users.Summing up the advantages of bots as a platform, Livingston cited no downloads, no new account, no new interface asthe major differentiating features.Livingston did caution against the strictly conversational, text-based approach being pursuedon other platforms, but said that overall it was still the early days, and there was still lots of experimentation in the space.What heenvisions is a more interface-centric approach that leads to less taps and more seamless usage.A lot of people are taking thatand saying,oh, toorder a pizza you should just writethat out, like, Hey there, Im Ted, and Id like one large pizza with pepperoni, please,' Livingston said. Thats like 100 taps. I just want toclick one large pepperoni pizza.'Overall, Livingston believes that the era of native apps may benearing an endand that bots have hugepotential,thoughthe tools for devs to build themare going to need a little TLCfor chatbotsto reach ubiquity.
