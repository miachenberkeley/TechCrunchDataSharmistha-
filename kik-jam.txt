Mobile messaging firmKik is upping its focus onmusic after launching a new service toconnectfans of top artists and bands via its popular chatapp.Named Jam, itis designed to help Kiks 200 million registered users meet new friends based on similar music interests.Initially in beta and limited a few hundred thousands users, Jam  which is built on Kiks HTML5 content platform  showcasesa range of top names in music.Clicking through on each profile loads photos, bios and YouTube-powered videos, while there are options to buy gig tickets and merchandising via BandPage. The real aim isnt to showcase content, though; its to create chat rooms for music lovers, and Kik users can check into an artist/bands chat room via their profile pagecan find friends to chat one-on-one via the page.The move is an interesting one for Canada-based Kik, which has quietly grown into one of the leading challengers to Snapchat in the U.S. The company has been focusing on multimedia servicesof late, and co-founder and CEO Ted Livingston previously hinted that Kik willtake a leaf out of the Asian messaging app playbook with its own payment service and other features that complement thechat experience.For now, it seems that Kik is focused on engaging its user base, though, which draws heavily from the teen and early-20s crowd in the U.S. and Europe. Kik introduced hashtags, which act as chat rooms in December, but we understand that the service hasnt done as well as the company had hoped.Hashtags are mini social networksdesigned to help users find like-minded individuals on Kik easily. For example, clicking #soccer would take me to a platform for lovers ofthe beautiful game  but it seemingly required a level of user-led discovery.With Jam, however, Kik is making that discovery easier than ever. Rather than having to find the #edsheeran hashtag, fans of the singer can almost accidentally stumble into his chat room through his songs, music and other information within Jam.That appears to be the theory at least, although Kik explainedin a blog post that Jam is initially experimental.The initial distribution will be limited to a few hundred thousand people so we can see what works, what doesnt, and what to work on next.We expect the service to change over time, it said.Kiks focus on chat around music is interesting because it contrasts with other messaging apps thathave jumped head first into hosting content themselves. Most notably,Snapchat introduced its Discovervideo service earlier this year, but others are also turning to music.This summer, Asian messaging app Line began offering a standalone, paid-for music service that syncs with its chat app, and others are likely to follow, too, as music streaming heats up.Kik is sticking to its guns by focusing on chat. Grouping users by their music taste  and potentially other areas of interestif Jam is replicated acrossother verticals  could boost its promoted chat service, a money-making feature that lets brands use the service to connect with users.
