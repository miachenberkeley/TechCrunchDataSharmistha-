Kim Dotcom revealed in an interview on Slashdot that he is no longer involved with Mega  he isnt working for the company anymore, but he also doesnt own any shares of Mega. Dotcom also said that you shouldnt trust Mega to host sensitive files anymore, and that he is planning to build yet another file storage service in the coming months.The company has suffered from a hostile takeover by a Chinese investor who is wanted in China for fraud. He used a number of straw-men and businesses to accumulate more and more Mega shares, Dotcom said in Slashdots community interview. Recently his shares have been seized by the NZ government. Which means the NZ government is in control.As a reminder, Megaupload gained popularity a few years ago as you could find a lot of copyrighted files available to download. The company sold subscriptions to let you download files more quickly. In January 2012, the domain names were seized and the site was shut down by the U.S. Department of Justice. Dotcom later was arrested by the New Zealand police for an investigation related to Megaupload.Even though the legal battle is ongoing, Dotcom launched Mega in January 2013, a new cloud storage service. It never became as popular as Megaupload, and now it seems like Dotcom has nothing to do with it anymore. Mega was supposed to protect your data by encrypting your files client-side. But now that there is a new team at the head of the company, its unclear whether the company still encrypts your files before uploading them.As a result of this and a number of other confidential issues I dont trust Mega anymore. I dont think your data is safe on Mega anymore, Dotcom told Slashdot users.Once again, Dotcom will launch another file hosting service in the coming months. According to him, he is subject to a non-compete clause until the end of 2015. I will create a Mega competitor that is completely open source and nonprofit, similar to the Wikipedia model, he said.
