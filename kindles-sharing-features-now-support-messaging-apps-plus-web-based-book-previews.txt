Kindle e-book reader owners will nowhave a new way to socialize with their friends about their favorite books or book quotes by way of mobile messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, texting, and more. The change is indicative of the trend toward private sharingas the preferred means of connecting with friends, versus larger, more public social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.The ability to share quotes or recommendations previously supported sharing to Facebook and Twitter, for example, but as Amazon Kindle SVP Russ Grandinetti explained in the company announcement, the perfect quote in a book isnt always the perfect quote for your whole social network.The addition makes sense for a number of Kindle readers. Book club groups, for instance, could take advantage of the private sharing option to getinto more in-depth conversations around the current title theyre reading viamessaging apps or email. Plus, users can nowsharetheir book recommendations in a more personal fashion by messagingjust those friends who they think would really enjoy the title, as opposed toposting a status update to Facebook.The upgraded feature allows for sharing of quotes, highlights as well as recommendations with specific friends, and is immediately availableon Kindle for Android.Support for Kindle e-readers and other devices is expected for later this year, the company says.Besides expanding the sharing options, those who receive a book recommendation or shared quote will be able to start reading immediately, Amazon notes. This is similar to how links to articles or videos work on the web today. When a userreceives the share, they can access a free book preview in the browser, right on their phone, tablet or PC. They wont need to sign up, sign into their account, or install an app to begin reading.This latter item may seem like a minor upgrade, but by removing the friction around translating a social share into something that can be accessed and read immediately, Amazon could potentially convert more recipients to Kindle customers in the long run.If youre curious how this will work, youcan try out the feature now, using examples Amazon has provided fromDivergent, The Book Thief, andThe Hobbit.
