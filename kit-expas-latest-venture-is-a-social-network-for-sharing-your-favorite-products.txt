Kit, the newest startup to launch out of startup studio Expa in NYC, is looking to give you a way to share your own product reviews, bundled by category, with your friends and the greater community.Competing in its own way with platforms like ProductHunt and Pinterest, as well as media publishers like CNet and Wired that help their audiences make informed purchasing decisions, Kit asks regular users with a particular interest or expertise in various categories to make their own kits.These kits can be based on various categories and should include only products that the creator has owned and used.The product is the brainchild of Naveen Selvadurai, partner at Expa and cofounder of Foursquare.The Kit platform has been in a closed beta for the past six months and is now ready to open up to the public. Selvadurai explains that this is the best way to get community feedback and see how people use it.Obviously, the ability to bundle a group of products together into a Kit is a big differentiator from the almost-competitors listed above, but Kit also has another trick up its sleeve.Folks who post Kits to the community are able to attach their own Amazon Affiliate ID to products linked on Amazon and receive an affiliate fee each time they inspire a purchase.Not many platforms like this give their users a way to make money right off of the bat, said Selvadurai. We realized that we wanted to reward the people who were doing the hard work and putting in the effort to create cool kits, so this move just made sense.Kit has a few ways of organizing content. Selvadurai likens it to the App Store, showing a combination of trending kits and kits curated by an internal editorial staff. Plus, Kit will surface the kits that your friends have shared first.Kit beta users have already created kits in the categories of traveling, cycling, Pilates, photography, decorating, DJing and more.You can check out Kit for yourself right here.
