After more than a year in development, KnowMe, a new video creation andsharing platform, is launching on the iPhone.The app was created by Andrew Jarecki, the Emmy-winning and Academy Award-nominated filmmakerbehind The Jinx, Catfish, and Capturing the Friedmans.KnowMe was designed from the ground up to give its users access to video editing technology that would feel less complicated and bulky than existing editing alternatives.Essentially, the startup wanted to provide a content creation tool that would disappear into the background, letting your content take center stage.KnowMe definitely accomplishes this mission.The app, which on first launchprompts users to participate in an interactivetutorial with KnowMeambassador Nev Schulman, is incredibly easy to use.User make videos bycombining live footage, pre-captured photos, and narrated audio recordings to create a final product thatis something in between a slideshow and a Vlog.Editing is done viaa processthat feels less formal than your traditional timeline based editing suite. The result is an interface that actually makes it fun to create clips.With the average finished productbeing around 40 seconds in length, KnowMe videos are definitely more polished and engaging than a vine or Instagram video, but feel more informal than something on YouTube.Essentially, theshort clipsare able totell a story while still being short enough for users toconsumeon the fly.The app will also include a discovery component, allowing users to view popular videos from other users. However,Jarecki explained that the app will also allow exporting to other social media platforms, which should accelerate user adoption.KnowMe is available for download today in the iOS App Store.
