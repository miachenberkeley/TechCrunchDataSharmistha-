Kobos new Glo HD e-reader will boast the claim of highest resolution for the lowest price when it hits the market on May 1 for $129.99. The newest piece of hardware fromRakuten-owned Kobo offers 300 ppi pixel density on a 6-inch display, which matches the screen on the $199.99 Kindle Voyage in terms of resolution, and which should mean extremely crisp, pixel-free rendering of text.In fact, both the Kobo Glo HD and the Kindle Voyage use e-inks Carta screen tech, which means text renderingsimilar to what youd get with a super high resolution e-ink screen like those found in iPhones and modern Android devices, albeit using the low-power e-paper tech that displays in black and white and is better suited to a dedicated text reading device.The Glo HD also features Kobos ComfortLight tech, which provides built-in lighting for reading in the dark. Other tech specs include a 1GHz processor (again, like the Voyage) and it has 4GB of on-board storage for your library (again, like the Voyage), which is plenty for most. It weighs just 180 grams (again, like the Voyage) and measures 157 x 115 x 9.2 mm (slightly shorter, but slightly thicker than the Voyage).The main things the Voyage has that the Glo HD doesnt is automatic lighting adjustment based on ambient lighting conditions, and page turn pressure buttons on the bezel. Kobos options also only has Wi-Fi connectivity, without a cellular option. Allare nice-to-have features, but the resolution is honestly the Voyages greatest strength, so the Kobo offering the same screen type with a significant price savings could help it find a faithful audience  provided customers are willing to go with Kobos content ecosystem over Amazons.
