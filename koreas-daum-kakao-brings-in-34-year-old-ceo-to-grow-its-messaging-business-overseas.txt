Daum Kakao, the $7 billion Internet company that ownsmessaging app Kakao Talk and recently bought Path, has turned to youth after hiring a new CEO topush its business forward and grow overseas.The organization, created last year when messaging firm Kakao merged with desktop Internet firm Daum, isreplacing its existing co-CEOs (who stayed on after the merger) withJi Hoon Jimmy Rim, the 34-year-old founder of Daum Kakao-owned VC firmK Cube Ventures.Rim, whospoke at TechCrunchs Meetup event in Seoul in April, has beenselected to help accelerate the speed of mobile innovation, Daum Kakao said.Rim, formerly a principal atSoftbank Ventures Korea,founded K Cube three years ago and, aside from being acquired by Kakao, the firm became one of the most notable in Korea, with more than 50 investments.His appointment is due to be confirmed at a shareholder meeting next month, but Daum Kakao is already positioning his arrival as the next phase for the company.The strategic decision to shift to a single CEO structure was strongly suggested and recommended by the two current co-CEOs of the company, Saehoon Choi and Sirgoo Lee. The co-CEOs have successfully completed the cultural, structural integration of Daum Kakao post merger, and have established a competitive basis for a new mobile life platform, the company said in a statement.Kakao Talk is arguably the most influential mobile app in Korea. Installed on over 95 percent of smartphones in the country, beyond allowing free text messages, voice and video calls over the Internet, the service offers social games, brand marketing, mobile paymentsand a taxi-hailing feature, and it has plans for more services.While Kakao Talk has been a smash hit on its home turf, the service hasnt translated that into international reach. Arguably the first of its kind in the world, it has seen Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line and WeChat become more popular in Asia and other regions. Following the merger last year, Daum Kakao pledged to become more competitive overseas. The acquisition of Path earlier this year is the most evident example of this new focus, and it will be interesting to seewhat ideas Rim has for expanding the service overseas and retaining its dominance in Korea.I will do my best to accelerate Daum Kakaos transformation to become not only a prominent mobile company in Korea but also a competitive player in the global market, Rim said in a statement.Kakao isnt alone in switching its leadership this year. Japans messaging app Line, which is actually owned by Daum Kakaos Korean rival Naver, promoted its COO to CEO in March as part of a new focusonits services business and growingits user base in Asia. The company is tipped to IPO in the future, but it isstruggling to grow its revenue after suffering its first quarter-on-quarter drop in Q2 2015.
