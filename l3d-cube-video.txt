Earlier this year,Looking Glass successfully raised $252,000 on Kickstarter for its 3D LED cube, dubbed the L3D Cube.Now the startup actually is shipping cubes  or, rather, kits for assembling your cube  and co-founders Alex Hornstein and Shawn Frayne are getting settled into a new office in Brooklyn. (Frayne is splitting histime between Brooklyn and Hong Kong.) So we stopped by to take a look atthe cubeand get a better sense of the teams vision.Granted, the cube cant show particularly detailed images or animations, but Frayne said thats the next step.Were doing these stages to understand how people interact with this very very different type of display, he said. Its not a screen, its like a living digital object that takes up real space.
