Online harassment is no good. Unfortunately, 40 percent of all people on the internet report experiencing some form of harassment online and 70 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 24 have been targeted, according to Pew Research Center.A young person who was being bullied a few generations ago could escape the abuse by going home, Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gagas mom and president of Born This Way Foundation, said in a release. But today that harassment can follow them anywhere. Every computer, tablet, and smartphone can be used as a tool of cruelty and hate. Thats simply unacceptable and at Hack Harassment we believe we can and must do better.At the Recode conference today, Germanotta announced the Hack Harassment pledge, which has already been signed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Vox Media CEO and Chairman Jim Bankoff and Recode Executive Editor and co-founder Kara Swisher.
