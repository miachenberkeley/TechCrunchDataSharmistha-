Lamudi, the Rocket Internet-backed online property listings company for emerging markets, has closed a $18 million (16 million) round of funding todevelop its marketshare and revenues worldwide.The capital comes from a trio of stalwart Rocket Internet backers:Asia Pacific Internet Group  the joint venture between Rocket Internet and Ooredoo  Holtzbrinck VenturesandTengelmann Ventures. Lamudi previously raised $7 million in April 2014.The service was launched in October 2013 and, though run out of Rocket Internet HQ in Berlin, it is presentin 32 countriesacross Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Lamudi said ithas over 550,000 listings from its markets in Asia and Latin America, and more than800,000 in total.The companys next phase  buoyed by this funding  is to tighten the screwand win competitive markets, monetize nascent ones, and add new services to itsproduct, Lamudi co-founder Paul Philipp Hermann told TechCrunch.Our business is atdifferent stages ineach market. In more developedplaces,we have to show that we offer a better services than our competitors, while in markets where we are first movers  such as Myanmar or Bangladesh  we have to convince the industry ofthe opportunities of online advertising, he said.On that note,Hermann explained that  in some nascent markets  Lamudi is practically pitching the internet to property developers and real estate agents who still rely on offline channel for business. As a result, it offers months-long free trial periods to customers in certain countries, to let them taste the potential of the internet without financial commitment. Now it is working totransition those testing its serviceinto payingsubscriptions, via a monthly listing fees and/or banner advertising space.Hermann wouldnt reveal details of Lamudis current revenue levels. Since it is raising capitaland focusing on monetization, it is fair to assume that Lamudi  like other Rocket Internet-backed companies in emerging markets  is some way from being profitable at this point.Lamudi has a wide geographical spread and over 800 staff, butHermannindicatedthat it has identified most of its core markets at this point.Weconstantly look at additional expansions. We wont grow as fast as last year but wecould moveinto two or three new countriesin the next few months where we see good opportunity and a chance to win the market quickly, he added.On the product side of things, Lamudi is working to introduce a new option that allows developers to showcase and sell new and under-development properties. SoftBank-backed Housing.com in India saw success selling new developments online  albeit exclusively  and Lamudi willintroduce the service in its more advanced markets over the coming months.Hermann said that Lamudi wont demand exclusivity, though, since hesconfident that prospectivecustomers will see that our approach is better and more cost efficient than alternative sales channels.A footnote to thefunding news, Lamudi alsorevealed that it hasmerged its businesses in Asia and Latin America to create Lamudi Global.Hermann said these changes are merely organizational. LamudisMiddle East and African businesses remain affiliated but separate since they arepart ofRocket InternetsMiddle East Internet Holding andAfrica Internet Groupunits, he explained.
