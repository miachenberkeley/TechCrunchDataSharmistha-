Years ago, when TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington was dreaming up ideas for what the original Crunchies statuette would look like, he drew inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey. In particular, that scene in the early part of the movie in which the apes start using bones as tools and weapons for the first time.Years have passed and our statuettes have changed ever so slightly, but we still hold tight to the primate tradition. And why not? Were now in our 8th year of putting on the Crunchies and each year the event just keeps getting better.Anyway, we were reminded of all this not too long ago when the Crunchies Monkey stopped by our office to work for a few hours. Technology may have improved over the years, but he expressed the same level of frustration ashis ancestors back in the Stone Age. Check out the video above to see what happened.Once youve done that, maybe youll want to vote for your favorite startups and help us pick winners for Crunchies categories like Best Founder, Best VC, and Best Overall Startup for 2014. And you should probably buy your ticketsif you havent already.The Crunchies will be here in just a couple ofweeks, and you dont want to miss out on what is basically the best awards show for startups, VCs and tech people.Too cheap to buy a ticket?
