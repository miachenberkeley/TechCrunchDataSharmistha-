Lawn care startup LawnStarter is announcing that it has raised $6 million in Series A funding.The company describes itself as your personal lawn care concierge  the idea,said co-founder Steven Corcoran, is to express LawnStarters focus on customer experience.Similar to the way that startups like Handy and Homejoy (soon to be one and the same?) have brought home cleaning reservationsonline, LawnStarter allows you to book appointments with gardening pros via the web or mobile app, and rate those pros afterwards. It also notifies you when schedules change due to weather or if youre due for a seasonal service.With lawn care, its not the ordering thats the issue  its the ongoing relationship that ensues months and years down the road, said co-founder Steve Corcoran. Many homeowners typically have to deal with two or three different service providers (one for mowing, one for fertilization, etc.). We aggregate all of that into one convenient purchase point.LawnStarter isnt the only startup in this market  for example, Robin, another Texas-based lawn care company, recently launched with $1.2 million in seed funding.I think the thing that fundamentally makes us different is our focus on really helping these existing businesses grow, Corcoran said. We didnt start this company as one of the million verticals of on demand companies; we actually started when our friend quit his job to do lawn care full time prompting us to help him grow his business.The service is currently available in 12 cities, including Austin, San Diego, Orlando and Washington, D.C. (So as a New Yorker, I wasnt able to test this out myself. Also, I dont have a lawn. Or a house.) Among other things, new funding will allow it to addnew markets.
