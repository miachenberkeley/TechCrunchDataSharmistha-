Most startups struggle when it comes to understanding the underlying financial metrics that typically determine the success or failure of theirbusiness. At the same time, they are often keeping the books in online tools with easily accessible data. Leap Financial, a startup participating in the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield competition this week, wants tomake it easy to connect to these services and track their most meaningful business metrics.The tool, which the founders are calling Financial Planning and Analysis as a Service, has been designed to automate tasks around accounting and help userstrack key performance numberslike revenue, churn, cost of customer acquisition, monthly recurring revenue and more.This usually requires pulling together data manually from a variety of sources into an Excel spreadsheet and creating formulas around the measurements. This can be a huge challenge for startups, especially if the founders dont have a finance background. Thats where Leap Financial comes in.You simply log into your bookkeeping service, your CRM tool or whatever other accounting service, and Leap pulls in the data and begins generating reports almost instantly, co-founder Raymond Lau explained.For now the company works predominantly withonlineaccounting and finance services, but itsworking to add CRM and payrollto give a more complete financial picture.The reports enable users to quickly see their data acrosstime frames (monthly, quarterly, etc.) Each metric is explained in practical terms, including how the numbers were determined, acting as a training tool for founderswho might need to learn basic finance on the fly.There are companies at the higher end of the market, whether older ERP tools from SAP or Oracle, and more modern tools like Tidemark, Anaplan and Adaptive Insights, but Leap is aiming at the lower end of the market. It has an initial target marketof high growth SMBs with between10 and 500 employees, but there is no reason it cant accommodate larger companies over time.The company has four employees right now including the two co-founders.
