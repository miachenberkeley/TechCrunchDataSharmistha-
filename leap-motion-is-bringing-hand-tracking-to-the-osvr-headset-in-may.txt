The open-source OSVR virtual reality headset is getting one of its first peripherals in the form of an optional faceplate that brings hand tracking to virtual reality projects via an embedded camera.Powered by Leap Motions sensors and software, the add-on will support projects that previously took built on the Leap Motion SDK using the companys Controller. Itll also let developers pass video from the camera on to the display, making it easier to give users some idea of the space around them while still wearing the headset.Taking advantage of the headsets internal USB ports, the faceplate slots into the headset seamlessly. The only indication of the sensors presence are the three red lights that show up when the headset is powered on.The faceplate willbe available from Razers store for the OSVR Hacker Dev Kitwhen the headset goes up for pre-order in May. Though Leap Motion declined to mention its launch price, it will likely fall somewhere in the $80-100 range as its Controller and bundles.Given the OSVRs $199 price tag, grabbing both will probably cost less than purchasing a $350 Oculus Rift developer kit and Leap Motions controller and headset mountif youve got an idea for a VR experience that could benefit from precision hand gestures.On the other hand, the Rifts display supports a 75hz refresh rate compared to the OSVRs 60, so those prone to motion sickness should probably go the Oculus route.
