If you know LeEco at all, its likely for the Chinese companys smartphones. Or, maybe youve caught wind of its video streaming services or smart televisions  it was known as LeTV until fairly recently, after all.Thoseelements were present in a massive Beijing press conference held earlier today (including a trio of new smartphones that have done away with the headphone jack, in favor of USB-C), but the true highlight came when a visiblyemotional CEO Jia Yueting unveiled the LeSEE concept car.Following a fittingly dramatic promo video loaded with gratuitous shots of the concept cars curves, Yueting hailed it on his phone using voice recognition, a nod to the companys plan to market the LeSEE as a sort of futuristic, autonomous taxi.Company co-founder Ding Lei offered the public its first peek as he drove it out on stage at a speed only appropriate in school zones and press conferences. Choking back and later apologizing for his tears, Yueting then ordered the car to go back and park itself.The car-gawking public will get a closer look at the LeSEE (pronounced, fittingly, similarly to lessee) at the upcoming Beijing Auto Show  though the company did offer up some interesting tidbits about the autonomous concept vehicle, including a top speed of 130 MPH, an exterior display on the front of the car and a foldaway steering wheel.There also looks to be a fairly impressive on-board entertainment system, featuring back-of-seat displays and isolated music playback, so passengers can listen to different things at the same time.All of this comes as stories roll inabout that other consumer electronics maker that has apparently been steadily toiling away on an electric car of its own for some time. It shouldnt be a complete shock that LeEco got there first, however. The company has, after all, already dipped multiple toes in the water, both through its backing of Faraday Futures buzzworthy conceptand a joint venture with Aston Martin announced back in February.
