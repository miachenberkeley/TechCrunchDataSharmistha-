Lenovo, the worlds largest PC maker and fifth largest smartphone firm, is laying off3,200 employees as it bids to return to improvedfinancial health following a disappointing last quarter of business.The Chinese company confirmed in an announcement thatthe cuts will reduce overall headcount by five percent (or ten percent of its non-manufacturing staff) in a move that shouldtrim itswage bill by an estimated $1.35 billion per year. The news emerged after Lenovo published its results, which sawoperating profit sinkby more than 50percent year-on-year to reach $105 million.Lenovo reported revenue of $10.7 billion, up three percent on the same period last year, but significant declines in demand for PCs worldwide, increased competition in Chinas smartphone market  which is also, notably, shrinking  and large currency fluctuations in Latin America dragged the firm, and its Motorola subsidiary in particular, down.Last quarter, we faced perhaps the toughest market environment in recent years, said Lenovo CEO and Chairman Yuanqing Yangin a statement. To build long term, sustainable growth, we must take proactive and decisive actions in every part of the businesses.In addition to the layoffs, Lenovo will write off $300 million in unsold smartphones, and spend $600 million to restructure its smartphone businesses so that Motorola and Lenovoare more strategically aligned.This latest earnings period has been pretty disastrous for a clutch of notable Android smartphone makers. HTC, which is now essentially worthless, outlined a new streamlined strategy after a $252 million loss. Over in Korea,LGs sales dropped andSamsungs growth slump continued, while, in Japan,Sonys mobile businessperformed poorly once again, too.
