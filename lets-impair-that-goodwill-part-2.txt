Microsoft fired a number of executives today, including Stephen Elop, an executive that returned to the company following a tenure as Nokias CEO. Elop made his way back to Redmond after Microsoft bought the majority of Nokias hardware assets.And thus did Microsofts phone chickens come home to roost, and temporarily impair the companys earnings per share.Now Elop is out, along withJo Harlow, who joined Microsoft alongside Elop. The two exits at once are notable not merely for their import in changing how Microsoft approaches its phone work  Windows head Terry Myerson is now running that show  but what it might mean for Microsofts balance sheet.As TechCrunch reported in April, Microsoft made a pretty stark comment on the health of its phone group, which is the underpinning of the goodwill that it carries relating to the Nokia purchase. Its likely in the billions. If Microsoft has to write down that item, it could easily bork the firms single-quarter earnings per share, throw its larger phone strategy into doubt and drive developers to rival platforms.Or perhaps not, but the tea-leaf train is indicative of something negative. Lets do this quickly so that we can move on:1. As Business Insiders Matt Weinberger wroteat the time of Microsofts last earnings report, and I quote this for a second time: [T]he last time Microsoft used language like this in an earnings report was back in 2012, three months before it took a $6.2 billion charge to its bottom line for its aQuantive acquisition.2. Elop exits, along with Harlow, and their group is folded into a larger internal entity.3. Profit?3a. Probably not.For a much longer, more technical look at the potential impacts of the goodwill question, head here. But I think that its fair to speculate that, given the warning by the firm, and then the massive internal switcheroo combined with the exits, something is likely afoot.You can handicap your GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates accordingly.Microsoft declined to comment on the matter.
