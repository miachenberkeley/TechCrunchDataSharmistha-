As is my wont, I like to spend the warm summer months in Central Europe, far from sandy beaches, palm trees and pia coladas. Instead, I prefer Zywiec, the Baltic and conifers. Therefore I invite you and yours to come out to our meet ups in Gdynia, Warsaw, and Krakow where well eat fine sausages and network under the Polish stars.The meetups will be held on July 28, 29 and 30 and were still deciding on venues. Were looking for sponsors as well so please contact myself or Ralph Talmont to help out.Until then please put us on your calendar. Well be heading up to Gydnia first, then Warsaw, then Krakow and I will hold pitch-offs in each city. Ill be posting RSVP info and application links shortly. Until then, please recommend some spots for the events and pencil us into your calendars. Nara.
