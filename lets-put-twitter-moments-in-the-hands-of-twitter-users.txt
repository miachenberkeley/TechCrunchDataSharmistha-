Storytelling is fun, but its also not easy. You have to have an idea of what story you want to tell and what pieces to include to illustrate it. Sometimes its words, sometimes its photos, sometimes its videos, and sometimes its all of them.Moments is a tool for Twitter itself to pull together these things and nag you talk you into viewing them. ENGAGEMENT!However, what Twitter is missing out on is the need and the want for users to tell the stories themselves. No editor at any publication could ever beat the masses when theyre on a mission to tug at your heartstrings, make you laugh or anything in between. I mean, people would spend time stitching this stuff together if they had an elegant tool to use.This tweetstory illustrates my point perfectly:Greatest tweet all time  pic.twitter.com/K0tepPISTe FEB 3 (@lowkeyhigh) January 6, 2016Id click on those (on purpose).
