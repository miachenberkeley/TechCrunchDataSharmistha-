LG is about to announce its latest flagship smartphone, the G Flex 2. It bends! Thats the big news.But dont get too excited. The new bendy LG phone is more of an assurance that the G Flex 2 is durable. Yet, the bend itself doesnt promise added functionality of any sort. However, durability is clearly a focal point. However you bend the phone, LG promises that the phone will bend back to its original curvy shape.Alongside the bendiness, the G Flex 2 is also coated with the same special plastic polymer we saw on the original G Flex, which is resistant-ish to scratches and self-heals. This time, it doesnt take minutes to remove scratches, it only takes seconds. Overall, the phone looks a lot like the recently released LG G3, but with a banana shape.The new phone has a 403ppi 5.5-inch OLED display (same size as the iPhone 6 Plus) with a 13-megapixel dual-flash rear camera and a 2.1-megapixel front shooter. Under the hood, the specs are the best of the best, with a 64-bit 2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and 2GB of DDR4 RAM under the hood, with support for 300Mbps LTE.It comes with 16GB or 32GB of internal storage, with options to expand through a MicroSD phone. Youll also find a 3,000mAh battery under there.All in all, its yet another LG phone.The info leaked early, which happens a lot here at CES. The Flex 2 will hit the store shelves in late January in South Korea, with more countries to follow.
