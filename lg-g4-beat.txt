In a bid to appeal to different segments of the global smartphone market,LG has released another new version of its flagship G4 device. Following on from on from phablet and budget modelsunveiled in May, the Korean company todayannounced the G4 Beat, a mid-range incarnation.Sporting the same aesthetics, the G4 Beat is slightly smaller than its parent model at 5.2 inches  the G4 is 5.5 inches  while theresa downgraded eight-megapixel rear camera and five-megapixel front-facing camera. The chipset is also more modest  thats what you get for mid-range  in the form of an eight-coreQualcomm Snapdragon 615 Processor that clocks 1.5GHz. In addition, the onboard memory has been shrunk to8GB with1.5GB RAM.LG said the new handsetretains the best features and functions of the LG G4, delivering value without compromising performance or usability and its an impressive package, except that we dont know the retail price at this point  other than that it is mid-tier. (Weve asked LG whether it can be more specific here and well update if we hear more.)Update: The ballpark figure for the device is 400 (around $440), but exact pricing will vary in each market, LG tells us.Too often, mid-tier phones sacrifice overall usability in order to include that one killer feature, said Juno Cho, president and CEO of LGMobile, said in a statement. Our goal with the LG G4 Beat was to create a phone that was not only well- balanced in terms of display, camera, performance and design but delivered terrific value and satisfaction.The G4 Beat will debut in key markets in Europe and Latin America this month  some of those countries include France, Germany and Brazil  witha more global rollout coming soon after. LGs multiple model approach and its mid- and low-end portfoliohelped it rake in $475 million in profit last year  compare that to struggling fellow Android maker HTC  as it shipped 59.1 million smartphones. The Korean tech companywill hope this approach produces similar resultsfor the G4 series in 2015.
