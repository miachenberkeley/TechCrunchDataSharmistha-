Android fans wanting a touch of gold with their smartwatch  a la the Apple Watch  may be interested to learn of a fancy pants version of LGs Watch Urbane.Priced at just $1,200, theLG Watch Urbane Luxe is a limited edition timepiece produced by LG and jeweler Reeds. It will beshowcased at the IFA electronics show in Berlin this week and is available for pre-order on Reeds site now, though the actual product  the 500 of them being made wont ship until October.Beyond the standard LG Urbane, which is probably one of the nicest looking Android smartwatches to date, Reeds has added 23-karat gold plating and an alligator leather strap. If that didnt get your fancy, theres a bespokedeployment clasp and each LG Watch Urbane Luxe is individually numbered and presented in a piano gloss lacquered case with a signed certificate of authenticity.We can think of plenty of things more deserving of our $1,200, but maybe there are 500 people who will go for this. Im personally a much bigger fan of LGs new rollable keyboard, which is also being unveiled this week in Germany this week and will be a lot, lot cheaper. (Not to mention, infinitelymore useful.)
