LG had a good 2014, posting record quarterly shipmentsand doubling its annual profits. The company released some eye-catching smartphones (and smartwatches), but much of its success came down to solid, affordable mid-range devices.With Mobile World Congress, the telecom industrys biggest event, taking place next week,LG has revealedfournew mid-range products ahead of time that will be important for its continued success in 2015.The devices range from four-inches (Joy), to 4.5-inches (Leon),4.7-inches (Spirit), andfive-inches (Magna). Each is available in 3G and LTE flavors.The three larger phones are allpowered by a1.2GHz chip (3G models) or1.3GHz quad-core chip (4G versions) with Android (5.0) Lollipop installed out of the box. The main difference is each onescamera and battery capacity.The LG Magna, Spirit and Leon eachoffers aneight-megapixel rear camera, which drops tofive-megapixelson the 3G model. The Magna packs the highest quality front-facing camera (five-megapixels), followed by the Spirit (one-megapixel) and Leon (VGA camera).The Joy is the entry-level model, with a choice of1.2GHz quad-core or 1.2GHz dual-core processors, and a five-megapixel rear camera and front-facing VGA on both versions.LG often debutsnew features and design ideas with its high-end devices first.
