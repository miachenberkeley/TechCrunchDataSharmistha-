KoreasLG shipped a (then) record 14.5 million smartphones in the second quarter of 2014, but now, ayear later, its a different story. The firm just revealed its Q2 2015 financials and, while not as disastrous as HTCs, the company itself describes them as modest.The firm, whichenjoyed a pretty stellar 2014during which it doubled profits and shipped59 million phones, shipped 14.1 million in the last quarter of business which translated to salesof KRW 3.65 trillion ($3.33 billion), a meagre 1 percent increase year-on-year. (Itshipped 15.5 million in Q4 2014, and 15.4 million in Q1 2015.)Calling the last quarter extremely challenging across all segments of its business, LG admitted that the market for premium smartphones suffered from lower demand. That said, it claimed to have increased revenue in North America by more than one-third  thanks to its mid-range phones and tablets while it sold a record 8.1 million LTE smartphones in the quarter.The company has outed a number of new phones designed to complement its flagship G4, including the G4 Beat, G4 Stylus and G4c not to mention a mid-range phone for emerging markets. Along that line, the company said it willmore aggressively implement its dual strategy focusing on both premium devices, as well as mid-range smartphones.Overall, LGs revenue fell 7.6 percent year-on-year, but itsmobile business faired fairly well in comparison to other units. Its home entertainment business struggledas LGadmitted it lost ground on its rivals. Better news for its home appliances unit (sales up 10 percent quarter-on-quarter, and operating profit six percent annually), andvehicle business  which accounts for a relatively modest $411 million in revenue but saw sales rise 18 percent on the previous quarter  helped steer LG to a slim $206 millionprofit.
