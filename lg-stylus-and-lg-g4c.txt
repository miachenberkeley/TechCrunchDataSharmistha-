LGs G4, the company newest flagship smartphone, went on sale across the first parts of the world yesterday, and today the Korean company added two variants of the device to the mix.The G4 Stylus is a 5.7-inchversion of the phone which  as the name implies  comes with a stylus for navigation. Theres also a budgetmodel, the G4c, which comes in at five inches, as opposed to the regular G4 which sports a 5.5-inch screen.Design-wise, the devices are identically to the G4.Both the G4 Stylus and G4c support LTE and powered by a1.2GHz Quad-Core processor, although the Stylus is available in a more modestly powered (and presumably priced) 3G version too. Thepair pack lowerspecced cameras  one area where LG has placed emphasis with the G4.Both phones include five-megapixel front-facing cameras (the regular G4s is eight-megapixels), while the Stylus has a13-megapixel rear camera, that drops toeight-megapixels for the 3G version, which is the same as the G4cs.Those details aside, the othermain difference is battery size, as youd expect given the different screen sizes. The G4 Stylus packs a 3,000mAh battery, its smaller siblings is2,540mAh.HTC, Samsung and LG have each diversified their flagship devices with different sized and shaped to cater to varyingtaste and varying culture worldwide, and thats exactly what LG has done with these two products.The Korean company said these phones will go on sale across the world in the next several weeks. It did not say how much either willcost,other than that they are (apparently) exceptionally priced. The regular G4 is set to cost around $600 without a contract, or $200 if bought with a carrier package in the U.S.
