Life360, the maker of mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows Phone that help keep families connected, has acquired Chronos Mobile Technologies, a startup behind a number of mobile apps that passively collect data from users smartphones in order to highlight trends and connections between various behaviors. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Chronos had closed on a small seed round fromMaven Ventures, Draper Associates and Major League Baseball earlier in 2015.Chronos first made its debut at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2012with a simple time-tracking application of the same name designed by Stanford Business School gradsCharlie Kubal, formerly of Pandora and Google, andDylan Keil, previously a mechanical engineer.The app itself was then designed to appeal to quantified self enthusiasts, who wanted an easier way to gather data about their activities, including things like how long theywere at work, how long theyslept, how much time theyspent commuting, and more.A later release allowed users to automatically track whether they reached certain goals, like spending a certain amount of time of the gym, or spending more time with family, for example.In the years following the launch of its flagship app, Chronos added to its collection of apps to also include Waldo, an app that automatically alerted friends to your whereabouts; Tip Top(beta), which helps you find the best spots around the world as determined by friends and experts; and Steps + Sleep, which more narrowly focused on tracking those two health-related activities.Given Life360s focus on tracking family members and their daily activities, its easy to see why the company was interested in Chronos technology.According to Life360 co-founder and President Alex Haro, the two companies becameconnected with one anotherasboth were a part of the StartX network, though Life360 was aware of Chronos for some time.Their contextual-awareness technology and work on using passively-collected data to connect close circles is really closely aligned with our mission at Life360, explainsHaro. The power of this is to eventually create new form of passive communication for families.One potential use case for Chronos technology within Life360 is with its alerting feature. Today, the companys active users receive on average over 159 Place alerts per month (alerts received when family members leave or arrive at important places like work, home, school, etc.) By integrating a contextual awareness engine into this system, Life360 could make its alerting feature smarter, doing things like asking users to share photos while on a trip, or setting reminders for taskslikepicking up milk when one family memberleaves the office, while also informing the user theETA to their next destination.Haro says it was theIP and Chronos contextual awareness technology that first attracted Life360s interest, but hes also excitedto bring on the twoChronos founders as part of the acquisition. The founders will join full-time to help run Life360s location and context team.Theyve spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same things that were focused on: the future of location sharing, how can contextual awareness improve your connection the people you care most about, notes Haro.More importantly, perhaps, is the the tech that Chronos built was designed to be very efficient  though its using a lot of the phones sensors, it doesso without rapidly draining the battery. Thats a challenge that Life360 can relate to and understand. In addition, Chronoscontextual engine gets smarter over time by learning from user behaviors.The opportunity to bring in industry-leading context and location technology is very compelling to us, says Haro. A majority of what theyve done was on our product roadmap, but buying Chronos allows us to get there more quickly.Following the deal, which was a combination of both cash and stock, Chronos will continue to operate its standalone products up until the point that the Chronos technology is integrated into Life360, whose app today is used by 50 million families. At that point, current Chronos users will be transitioned to the Life360 app instead.Once inside Life360, the Chronos technology will offer users more insight into their familys day-to-day activities  letting themsee where they each spend their time, and what theyve been up to.Its arguable that some family members may notappreciate this level of detail and scrutiny, but Life360s current product has respecteduser privacy in the past by offering flexible location sharing combined with automated Place alerts for everyday check-ins. The addedtechnology will just add another layer of data on top of the basics already provided, which should make Life360feel more like a quantified self appthan the tracking and messaging utility it is today.
