Lightspeed Venture Partners, the 16-year-old, Menlo Park-based early-stage venture firm, has raised two new funds totaling $1.2 billion, according to two new SEC filings. One filing, for the firms 11th fund, shows a close of $715 million. Lightspeed has also raised $500 million for its second Select fund for later-stage companies.The capitalcomes two years after the firm last raised two new funds: $650 million for its tenth fund and $350 million for its first Select fund.The timing underscores a years-long trend of venture firms committing money more quickly to startups than they have historically and subsequently returning to their own institutional investors more rapidly for more funding. (Venture firms have traditionallyinvested over a three- to four-year period, rather than two years. As startups began shortening the length of time between rounds aroundearly 2013, the entire process becameaccelerated.)One would guessLPs didnt hesitate to write fresh checks to Lightspeed either way.Among its other investments, Lightspeedfamously wrote the first, $500,000 check to the young messaging giantSnapchat, which is now valued at $16 billion. (During an event that this editor hosted last year, managing director Jeremy Liew talked abouttracking down an elusive, Stanford student named Evan Spiegel to get that deal done.)Its other bets  which include both enterprise and consumer-facing companiesinclude The Honest Company, which is reportedly working with Goldman Sachs on a 2016 IPO.In addition to its U.S. office, Lightspeed has outposts in India, Israel, and China.
