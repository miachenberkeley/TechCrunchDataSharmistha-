It also has the ability to capture 12 megapixel stills.But the Lily differentiates by being tailored to its goal of filming the pilot, using a tracker to start an orbit around them. The Lily is also waterproof so it can be used by the pool or at the beach.According to the Lily Crunchbase page, the company had raised $1 million in seed before this most recent $14 million Series A round. Bijan Sabet, who led the round for Spark Capital, weighed in on the delayed shipping date in his own Medium post:We have confidence that the delay is the right thing to do for their customers and ultimately will give them the time to deliver the best possible product. I believe they will do just that.You can check out Lily for yourself right here.
