LinkedIn has made another acquisition to build out its big data recruitment business. Its acquired Careerify, a startup based out of Toronto, Canada, that focuses on software for businesses to hire people.Two of Careerifys products  anemployer branding software product(intended to help companies appear more attractive to prospective candidates) and internal mobility software (fancy naming for internal hiring software)  are being closed down. But a third product  Careerifys employee referral software  will remain open to existing customers. However, LinkedIn will not takeon any new users.LinkedIn is not providing any information aboutwhether it plans to revive the firsttwo products that have been sunset, or how it plans to evolvethe one that is currently live.This is an acquisition, not an acquihire, and the company already hadsome very well known large and small organizations using the product including Good Technology and SunGard.The referral software developed by Careerify fits right into LinkedIns bigger strategy as a business, which parses and crunchesdata that people input into their profiles (or is otherwise associated with them) to come up with synergies with other users, potential jobs and other professional connections.In thecase of Careerify, it uses an employees social connections  these daysvia LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook  to figure out who in an individuals network might be suitable for a job opening in that employees place of business.The problem that Careerify is solving is fairly common, and possibly one that you have come across yourself: when job openings come up at your office, and you get that email asking if you have anyone to refer as a potential candidate, you may be too busy to answer, or just unable to think of anyone suitable. The software from Careerify essentially automates that process  not unlike how LinkedIn automates a lot of its reading and connectionsuggestions to you today.But while Careerify may be solving a problem, it had a problem of its own: how to best position itself for future growth in a sea of social media companies and recruitment specialists that are growing bigger and bigger. Thats where LinkedIn comes in,CEO and founder Harpaul Sambhi wrotein a blog post announcing the deal:We decided to join LinkedIn due to what we lacked  massive scale, he said. More than 30,000 companies across the globe leverage LinkedIn for recruitment, and with more than 347 million members, LinkedIn offers an opportunity to make a much larger impact on job seeking and hiring.Three are people joining the company, Sambhi and two software engineers, Luthfur Chowdhury and Prashant Viswanathan, who will all become a part of LinkedIns Talent Solutions Team. (One other person is not joining.) The three are now working out of LinkedIns Torontooffice, but they will soon be relocating to Mountain View.Terms are not being disclosed.
