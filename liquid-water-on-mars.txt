In a Mars-related press conference this morning NASAhas announced that under certain circumstances liquid water has been found on Mars.Mars is not the dry arid planet that we thought of in the past, it said in a press conference streamed online today."Under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars"  Jim Green, NASA Planetary Science Director
https://t.co/MvErxberG3 NASA (@NASA) September 28, 2015Previously it was known that H20 existed on Mars in the form of ice but scientists had thought the atmosphere of Mars was too thin for liquid water to be possible.The scientists used a spectroscopy technique to analyzethe chemical composition of dark streaks (which NASArefers to asRecurring Slope Lineae or RSL) they had previously observed on the Martian surface. These streaks had been noticed to vary followingtemperature changes on the surface  leading to a hypothesis that the substance was water.Late last week theagency trailed a major science finding from its ongoing exploration of the red planet  showing continued savvy at NASAssocial media mission to sustainpublic interest in space exploration.Mars mystery solved? New science finding announced today at 11:30am ET.

Its Opportunity rover, which landed on the Martian surface back in 2004,is also still active  currently surveying a portion of the surface called Marathon valley.Discoveriesfrom the Curiosity mission to-date have included findingcalcium perchloratein the Martian soil, as well asspikes of methane. It has also roved into anancient streambed where liquidonce flowed, and unearthed clay minerals after drilling Martian rock  again suggesting an aquatic environment in the planets past. The roverhas also measured radiation levels with a view to assessing the feasibility of humans spending time on the planet.The presence ofperchlorate in the Martian soil improves the stability of liquid water on the surface of Mars, NASAscientists said today  enabling the liquid water to existfor longer before either freezing as the temperature on the planet drops, or boiling away in itsthin atmosphere. This means that Marswater is briny, rather thanpure.The viability for life to exist in this water is not clear at this stage, NASA added  although the presence of liquid water itself gives a huge boost to that search.My feeling when you look at Earth, water is an essential ingredient [for life] This is tremendously exciting. We havent been able to answer the question does life exist beyond Earth, but finding water is critical to that. We now have, I think, great opportunities to be in the right locations on Mars to thoroughly investigate that, said Jim Green, director of planetary science at NASA.Investigating the RSL sites themselves to probe for life is challenging, according to NASA, because the streaks have so far only been observed on steep slopes. So it said directlyprobing whether they contain life is likely to be the domain of future robotics spacecraft specifically designed to go there  craftwhich are also rigorously sterilized to avoid contamination by Earth-based microbes.Exactly where the liquidthatappears in the RSL comes from is unclear at this stage.The presence of liquid water on Mars could also help any future human mission to the planet, NASA added.It took multiple spacecraft over several years to solve this mystery, and now we know there is liquid water on the surface of this cold, desert planet, added Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program at the agencys headquarters in Washington. It seems that the more we study Mars, the more we learn how life could be supported and where there are resources to support life in the future.Water! Strong evidence that liquid water flows on present-day Mars. Details: http://t.co/0MW11SANwL #MarsAnnouncement pic.twitter.com/JNksawz2iN NASA (@NASA) September 28, 2015
