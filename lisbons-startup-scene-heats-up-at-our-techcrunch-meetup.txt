This week we held the first ever TechCrunch Lisbon Meetup and Pitch-off at a rooftop bar over-looking this beautiful, ancient city which in the last few years has been coming to life as a vibrant startup hub in this part of southern Europe.Thanks to the good offices of local accelerator Beta-i and a bar stacked by Android market startup Aptoide, around 200 people turned up to hear the pitches as part of our lead up to TechCrunch Disrupt London, our stupendous European conference, on December 5-8.We heard pitches from 11 startups in all but in the end there can be only a three winners.Quotanda won the pitch and a place in Startup Alley at Disrupt London. This is a lending-as-a-Service (LaaS) platform which enables universities and banks to launch student-financing programs.The runners-up were firstly Hoko, which is a platform where developers can manage smart links that drive users, contextually from one app to the other. They were followed by Betar.io (a startup built by three students!) which is building a platform to make it is easier for game developers to find great testers (based on a ranking system) and receiving feedback from them.The other startups that pitched were Remidi, Videona, Climber Hotel, Magnifinance, artica, Timeresq, TagJam and Primetag.
