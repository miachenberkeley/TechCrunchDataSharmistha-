Theres a good chance that youve never heard of LittleThings, but apparently its seeing rapid growth, thanks to a focus on positive and inspirational stories.In fact,according to data from NewsWhip, LittleThings wasresponsible for the single most popular Facebook post of 2015. The story isbasically just a write up of a two-year-old video of Ann and Nancy Wilson covering Stairway to Heaven, but thanks a clever, attention-grabbing description (44 Years Ago, He Wrote This Song. But When He Hears Her Sing It Like THIS, He Cries) and perhaps some Facebook voodoo, it has nearly 1.8 million Likes.Thats not just a fluke, either. The New York City startups comScore numbers show 49.5million unique visitors in October, making it theseventh-largest Lifestyle property. Not bad for a site that didnt exist a couple of years ago.LittleThings isalso announcing that its raised a debt round from City National Bank. Unfortunately, its not disclosing the size of theround (a spokesperson said the companydoesnt have permission to share that number), but itstill seems worth noting as LittleThingsfirst outside funding, and in the context of ever-larger funding rounds for digital media companies like BuzzFeedand Vox.Co-founder Joe Speiser told me hes taken a slightly different approach than many publicationsthat burn as much money as [they] possibly can. As I mentioned, LittleThingsdidnt raise outside funding for nearly two years  Speisersaidtaking on debt was super attractive now, particularly in comparison to an equity round, since it allowsLittleThings to grow with barely any strings attached and withoutdilution.It helps that thecompany is profitable, bringing in an estimated $25 million in in revenue during2015. LittleThings already has a headcount of 55, and Speiser said the funding will help it expand its reporting and video production, and also allow it tobuild an ad sales team.In addition to drawingreaders to its own site, LittleThings has also put a lot energy into attracting readers on Facebook  hence the big hit mentioned above. Speiser said hes expectingpublishers tosee big video monetization opportunitieson Facebook in 2016.Peopleneeded a break, a relief from the onslaught of news, he said. Its tough to consume all this content, it makesyou feel really depressed, so were happy to be  a safe haven.He added that LittleThings is trying to not just report on the news, but break the news. For example, it helped grant a terminally patients dying wish by working with Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses to bring a mini therapy horse to her hospitalroom  and then wrote about it. Apparently, this is something ofa venerable journalistictradition.
