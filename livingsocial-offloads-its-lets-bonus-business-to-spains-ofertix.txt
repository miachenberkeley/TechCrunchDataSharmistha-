The downsizingofLivingSocials international operationscontinues: the daily deals site has sold Lets Bonus  and its operations inSpain, Portugal, Italy and Chile. The buyers are the companys CEO and CFO, Juan Luis Rico and Joan Pina, as detailed by an internal memo sent out to staff today from Jim Bramson, LivingSocials head of corporate affairs and international.This is a milestone for LivingSocial: Lets Bonus was LivingSocials last remaining non-English language business. It also never migrated to the common LivingSocial platform. LivingSocials business is now focused only on English-language sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Ireland.Earlier, wed received a draft memo that notedthe buyer is a Spanish investor group led by Antonio Alcantara, the founder and head of Ofertix, a private buying club and e-commerce portal in Spain. It is not clear in the official statement if this investment group is actuallyinvolved  we are asking. LivingSocial says that there is no involvement from any outside groups.While there was outside interest in acquiring the business, the management buyout of Lets Bonus was the best possible result for the team, a spokesperson for LivingSocial says. She confirms also that Oftertix did not directly acquire the company: There is no involvement with Ofterix or its founder. The Lets Bonus CEO and CFO are not working with any outside group.Some background on the deal: LivingSocial acquired Lets Bonus in 2011,also for an undisclosed sum(and you should click on that link if only tomarvel at Robins opening sentence). It was part of the companysaggressive international expansion that saw it acquiring several other companies, following a routenot unlike that of its rival Groupon.That inorganic growth turned out to be a problematicplaybook: in cases wherethe businesses never migrated to a common platform, itwas impossible to properly account for how each was doing, let alone efficiently roll out new services that could have helped each of them as the basic daily deals model grew stale and less appealing to consumers. And given that the company has now sold off all of its non-English businesses, it seems that it never managed toovercome the language and cultural barriers very well, either.The decline of the daily deal has been a problem in LivingSocials home market as much as abroad.The company, which is 30% owned by Amazon, saw revenues decline by 23% last year. LivingSocialhas raised nearly $1 billion in funding. Its last round of $110 million in 2013 was at a valuation of $1.5 billion.The company is working to turn things around, though. Ithired a new CEO last year, eBay alum Gautam Thakar, to replace co-founder TimOShaughnessy at the helm. Thakar (who says he has never actually met Amazons Jeff Bezos but appreciates Amazons long-term support of his company okay) is trying to focus the companys business as consumers interest in the companys daily deals model continues to wane. Heis partly doingthat by repositioningthe business as an experiences marketplace; and partly by cutting costs and selling off assets like Lets Bonus.But thisis not the first international sell-off for LivingSocial. The most notable one was in 2013, when the company sold its South Korean business Ticket Monster to Grouponfor $260 million in cash and stock (LivingSocial initially bought the company for $350 million). Groupon, ironically, is nowlooking to sella majority stake in that operation.Below are the various memos I have received. First, the onesent out to employees,sent by a source in Spanish; second, the version LivingSocial has provided to me in English; third, the memo we got last night claiming a different sales outcome (but still accurately pegging the sale).- Mensaje reenviado -
