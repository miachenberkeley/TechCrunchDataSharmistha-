Slidejoy, a startup thatrewards users for putting news and advertising on their Android lockscreens, has unveiled a more comprehensivenewsreading experience.Co-founder Sanghoon Kwak led the development of the new Trends feature, and he said that previously, if you were reading news on Slidejoy, you saw one article at a time, and they came from about a dozen publishers. Slidejoy Trends, on the other hand, pulls stories from more than 500 sites, and it allows you to seea number of stories in a given category. (Slidejoy doesnt have direct relationships with all of those publishers  ultimately, its just pointing you to someone elses web page.)Put another way, the startup is getting closer to becoming a full-fledged news app. It allows you to browse the top newsin categories like Tech and Business  the rankings are based on things like the publication timeof the news and the interest shown byother readers. Users can also choose to follow stories from specific publishers.What Slidejoy isnt doing is personalizing the stories you see, so youre only presented with the ones that the app thinks youll like.Co-founder and CEO Robert Seo added that the companys long-term goal is to become the gateway to your phone.We just wanted to provide an easy way to provide users with access to all those different features, he said. Improving the news feature is just one aspect of that.
