LOLA, the first tampon subscription service to use 100 percent cotton tampons, is today announcing the close of a $3 million seed round of funding. The round was led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures with participation from Brand Foundry, BBG Ventures, BoxGroup, VaynerRSE, 14W, Seth Berkowitz, the founders of Warby Parker, Nicolas Jammet, Nathaniel Ru and Jonathan Neman, among others.LOLA launched back in July after receiving $1.2 million in angel funding. The premise was simple. Replacing chemical-filled tampons from big manufacturers like Playtex and Tampax, LOLA created an all organic cotton tampon that would be delivered on-demand in the perfect quantity and composition for its users.Ladies could choose how many super tampons, regular tampons, etc. they needed for a cycle and schedule a set delivery date each month so they never have to run to the grocery store in an emergency.Contrary to popular belief, cotton isnt the primary ingredient in most tampons, said cofounder Alexandra Friedman in an interview this summer. Tampons are typically made from a blend of the artificial fibers, rayon and polyester, and could also include chemicals and dyes.But these chemicals often arent listed as ingredients on the box, and since were usually given our first tampon at a young age from someone we trust, it would be easy to stick with the same brand a mom or a friend gave you as a child.Unfortunately, these chemicals are quite dangerous, especially when exposed to a ladys private bits. LOLAs tampons, complete with a plastic applicator, are made with 100 percent cotton to avoid any of these nasty chemicals.The company plans to use the funding to double its team, specifically in operations and customer service. The new cash should also help LOLA in an increasingly competitive market  startups like Cora and Le Parcel have come onto the scene with a similar subscription-based offering.To us, the introduction of new feminine care startups to market further validates the importance of not only all-natural options but also knowing whats in your products and having all the information to make conscious decisions, said cofounder Jordana Kier. We dont want to just make a splash with controversial period talk; we want to drive this cultural shift.The LOLA wouldnt be too specific when asked about new product verticals, but did say that they want to be a brand that provides feminine health and hygiene products for women throughout their lives.With that in mind, its not hard to imagine LOLA developing feminine hygiene pads or even products that help women transition through menopause.You can learn more about LOLA here.
