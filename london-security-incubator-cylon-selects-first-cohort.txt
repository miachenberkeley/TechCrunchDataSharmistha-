The CyLon Londonincubator was announced back in January, billing itself as Europes first dedicated cyber-security accelerator. At the time it said it was expecting to select about10 startups in its first intake.In the event its gone for six for itsfirst 12-week program, announcing the team list today.The not-for-profit incubator is not disclosing how many applications it received in total for, with Alex van Someren of Amadeus Capital Partners, one of the CyLon co-founders, saying only that it received a lot of applications, and hasfocused on quality not quantity.The selected startupscover a mix of security areas,including mobilebehavioral biometric authentication, a BYOD b2b solution relying onsandboxing to reduce risk, and cyber-attack risk assessment and attack simulation products. (See below for details on all six startups.)The CyLon program does not take equity in any of the selectedstartups, with the5,000 per founder living allowance that goes to selected teams provided by program sponsors. (Sponsors include Amadeus andEpsilon; global hedge fund Winton, and international law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; andFried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.)Despiteonly selectingsix teams, CyLonsextra office space is not going begging  with two established security companies, Ripjar and SQR Systems, being invited and choosing to base themselves in theWest Londonco-working space, alongside the selectedentrepreneurs.Regarding inviting two established companies to join the co-working space, van Someren noted: There are no strict limits on when people move out. We are building a community here so its important that we can be flexible.The demo day for the six-strong cohortis pegged for mid-July.CyLon will also open applications for its second program, due tocommence in Q4 this year, in the summer.Heres the list of inaugural startups, withtheirin-their-own-words descriptions:Security vs surveillanceCyLons launch event this evening is due to includean addressbySir Iain Lobban, who was director of U.K. intelligence agency GCHQ until November last year. Hes expected to describe the safeguarding of computer networks and the protection of privileged information  institutional or personal asabsolutely essential.Suchcomments are more than a little ironic, given the role government intelligence agencies have been shown to play in undermining data privacy  and arguably digital security generally  via dragnet surveillance programs whichharvest data via commercial services andby tapping into the Internet backbone,as revealed by documents released by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.Last fall Snowden specificallyattackedthe anything goes privacy intrusions ofthe U.K. intelligence agencies, saying: There are really no limits on their capabilities.What they do is they collect everything that might be interesting to them  which includes basically a five year backlog of all the activities of citizens in the U.K., for example by the collection of their metadata records, which is who they call, the locations that they travel where their cell phones are associated with towers.Early this year the U.K.s judicial oversight body for the domestic intelligence agencies also ruled that data-sharing agreements between GCHQ and the NSA had beenillegal in the past, on the grounds that they breached European human rights law.In his outgoing speech as GCHQ director Lobban defended GCHQs record, saying at the time: Today, of all the communications out there globally  the emails, the texts, the images  only a small percentage are within reach of our sensors.Of that, we only intercept a small percentage; of that, we only store a minuscule percentage for a limited period of time; of that, only a small percentage is ever viewed or listened to.The currentU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron has taken ahawkish stance on digital surveillance program in recent times, apparently callingfor a ban on strong encryption at the start of this year. Are we going to allow a means of communication between people which even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the Home Secretary personally, that we cannot read? No we must not, Cameronsaid in January, in an apparent bid to apply more pressure to Internet companies to perforate their own security systems in the name of counter-terrorism espionage.All of which is to say that U.K.-based security startups have to tackle all the usualentrepreneurial challenges, plus some additional hard political problems pushed onto their plate bythe military-industrial-surveillance-complexin which they are forced to operate.The security space generally requires a greater level of user trust than many other technology areas  trust which risks beingsystematically undermined by government trackingactivities.Unless of course youre making it your business to try to bolstergovernment intelligence efforts. Earlier this year the U.K. Chancellor George Osborne said GCHQ would beinvesting 3 billion over nine years todevelop what he dubbed the next stage of national cyber intelligence  working with hundreds of small businesses and recruiting hundreds of new cyber specialists as part of that process. Its that taxpayer-fundedcashthatsome of CyLons budding entrepreneurs may well have their eye on.
