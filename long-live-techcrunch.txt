Now, 10 years later, were still here, offering a unique, honest perspective on the industry that touches so many.There are a lot of reasons TechCrunch has survived acquisition(s), leadership changes, micro and macro bubbles and the parachute onslaught of the worlds journalists but one of the most important ones is you  our community.Youve stuck with us and continue to make it an honor to do what we do. And that, we think, is somethingto celebrate.Honoring the very first backyard celebration our founder held way back in 2005, TechCrunch is markingits blogging decade with a picnic of sorts in San Francisco. Wed love for you to join us on June 6, 2015, from 12-3 p.m. at the Presidio. Well bring the food trucks and beer; you bring a blanket and your friends.
