You can get pretty much anything on a stick. You can actually, and I kid you not, get fried butter on a stick. And soon, thanks to Intel, you can even get a full, Windows 8.1 PC on a stick.The Windows 8.1-basedCompute Stick contains a quad-core Atom processor, 32 gigabytes of storage, 2 gigabytes of RAM, andwi-fi and Bluetooth support. It will retail for $149, early this year. A separate Linux version will contain half the RAM, a third of the storage, andwill sell fora reduced $89.Heres the thing in all its stick-y glory:Intel is working to shrink the size of its computing products. Its new Quark SE SOC  system on a chip  could help the wearable revolution become less a dream, and more of a functional reality. Intel was late to smartphones and tablets  its earnings tell that story each quarter  but when it comes to even smaller machines, the company appears bent on not falling behind.
