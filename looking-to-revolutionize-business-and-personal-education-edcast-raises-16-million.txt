Asset Management, an investment arm of one of EdCasts existing customers, the new round will be used to expand the companys sales and marketing efforts and continue product development.The company, helmed by serial entrepreneur Karl Mehta, has two tracks.One is a consumer focused bid for lifetime learning based on mobile access to the companys bite-sized, user generated content.The other is a curated content feed, selected using both human expertise and precise algorithms based on customer data, that the company distributes to subscribers in businesses around the world.At least one division of G.E., whose asset management business unit led the current $16 million round, is a customer.We bring [businesses] relevant curated knowledge and insights as micro-learning every day, says Mehta.The company has a few hundred customers, according to Mehta, who are paying a subscription for the service.Relevant educational materials are delivered to employees of companies that subscribe to the service on a regular basis in a model thats very much like a daily briefing, according to Mehta.Imagine that President Obama gets his briefing every morning at the breakfast table, Mehta says. This is similar. If youre an executive or an employee at a company, we bring you relevant, curated information.On itsconsumer and enterprise channels EdCast now has close to 1 million users that are accessing the companys educational content every day, according to Mehta.
