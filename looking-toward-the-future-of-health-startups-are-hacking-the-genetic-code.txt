Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.Silicon Valleymay have coined the big data buzzword, but genomic scientistshave been workingwith massive datasets for decades. Due to recent breakthroughs in DNAsequencing technology, genetics is moving from the laboratory into the market, and just about everyone is taking a keen interest.In January, President Obama requested $215 million to fund his precision medicine initiative  $130 million to backa nationalresearch program that will trackthe data of 1 million volunteer donors, and another $70 million for aNational Cancer Institute initiative to identify the genetic drivers of cancer.Last week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made its largest investment yet in a $76 million equity round for CureVac, a company using mRNA as a template to make therapeuticvaccines for cancer and infectious diseases.In 2014, genomic tech companiessaw a near 50% rise in number of venture investments recorded while total capital committed more than doubled to reach$687 million last year. Consideringthat the number of Series A rounds grew by nearly 300% last year, it looks likethe funding surge willcontinue in 2015.While the majority of these deals are led by biotech investors, a handful of more traditional tech investors have begun to dabble ingenomics tech. Consumer genomics startup23andMe and genomic datamanagement platform DNAnexushave secured funding from well-knowntech investors, including Google Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, and First Round.Im a little bit biased because in a prior life I was working on a PhD in biochemistry, says Mike Abbott, a partner at KPCB who focuses on social, mobile and big data deals. But if you look at where we are today versus 20 years ago, its pretty remarkable  in the last couple of years weve really seen significant advances in genomics, says Abbott.Its now possible to sequence a human genome in a single day for $1,000. That breakthrough creates new opportunities for medical testing in areas that had been impossible dueto the prohibitive costs of sequencing.It took a number of years and over $3 billion to sequence one persons genomic information back in 2000, says Amanda Cashin of Illumina, the leading producer of genomic sequencing instruments. Since that time weve reduced the cost so fast for sequencing this information that they call it Flatleys law, after Illuminas CEO JayFlatley, Cashin says.Cashin runs theIllumina Accelerator, which offers genomics startups a $100k note from Yuri Milner, $100k in services from AWS, and access to sequencing instruments and lab space.The applications of genomics are vast  startups in Illuminas 2014batch range fromcancer diagnostics startup Xcell Biosciences toEpiBiome, an agriculture tech company developing treatments to prevent dairy cattle infections.The enormous potential for genetic applications has created an equally large challenge when it comes to processing, sharing, and analyzing the petabytes of data being generated by cheaper and more efficient machines. In a single year, the most advanced sequencing instrumentscan sequence 18,000 human genomes, produce three petabytes of data and consume three to five million computing core hours.A human genome has 3 billion base pairs  its helpful to think of it as 3 billion lines of code. The sequencing instrument reads 50 lines of code at a time, and you have to read each line30 times, says Dick Daly, CEO of genomics companyDNAnexus. So you get this giant pile of data, and its stilllargely unintelligible until it goes through asecondary analysis, he says.Dalys company leverages the cloud to build a networked management system for genomic data. As costs for genomic testing have come down, the company has seen a rise in thenumber of customers storing genetic data on its service.Big Pharma is now moving more aggressively into the use of gene sequencing and genomics in drug development, and theyve sort of hit the wall on their ability to do that without using the cloud, says Daly. Up until 6 months ago, almost all of Big Pharma was having people do analysis and then FedEx the physical hard drives, but the limits of that have been reached.As genomic testing becomes more mainstream,VCs have a clear advantage, regardless of a science background  bringing newtechto consumers is what the startup world does best.The interest that weve attracted from the venture community already after our first funding cycle is pretty phenomenal, says Cashin. Thats life science investors but tech investors as well  its a big data challenge and a lot of folks are jumping into the game, she says.
