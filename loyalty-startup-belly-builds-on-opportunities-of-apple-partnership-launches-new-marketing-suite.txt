Fresh off of Apples WWDC announcement earlier this summer that they would be partnering with loyalty rewards program Belly as one of theirmobility partners, Belly announced today thatitwill be rolling outa major product update toits merchant partners.The update focuses on Belly Complete, a cohesive suite of loyalty, email,social media, mobile and customer acquisition tools, and is aimed at allowing merchants access to palatabledata that shows them the successes of their previous campaigns and identifies areas where there could stand to be a little improvement.Most people either think of us as a consumer app or just a loyalty program, but retailers really use loyalty programs to drive their communications, Belly CEO Logan LaHive told me.Specifically, the new marketing suite allows merchants to further keep in touch with customers. According to a company press release, with the companys Auto-Engage tool, merchants are able to incentivize customers to come back by setting uptriggered offers that will automatically send based on their buying history. And with Campaigns, Belly is able to offer merchants enhanced analytics capabilities throughemail marketing created within the suite that measures the time between a message arriving in a customers inbox and their next trip to the business.Belly has experienced some significant growth over its past four years in business. The Chicago-based companycurrently has 6million users that have made over 60 million transactions with Bellyat the over 11,000 merchants that currently utilize the technology.Belly has also raised over $25 million in investments from partners like 7-Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and others.Belly has continued to quickly scale, and recently began a major partnership with Apple as the sole loyalty rewards program in its list of mobility partners.Regarding the companys new products and Apple partnership, a company press releasesaid:Duringthe companys July 21st earnings call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri mentioned that they areworking with select mobility partners, which Belly is part of, to drive businesstransformation across iOS devices.Bellys integration with the other included technologycompanies will enable businesses to put the unique capabilities of iPad to work withintheir organizations quicker and easier. As a signed partner, Belly will provide itsexpanded product to an even wider network of retail businesses.LaHive also chattedwith me about how the integration of Belly into Apples recently rebranded Apple Wallet meant the opportunity to reach out to more customers and make the product even more visible.With Apple Wallet theyve talked about loyalty and rewards being in [it], but I think what most people confuse is that Apple doesnt have a loyalty program and Apple isnt providing rewards, LaHive said. Most physical retailers dont have the technology and infrastructure to build their own Wallet functionality. With Belly, we are working with physical retailers to provide them with loyalty programs that work seamlessly with Wallet and can work seamlessly with Apple Pay.Belly has maintained a close relationship with Apple and was one of their earliest partners when Passbook was launched in 2012.For LaHive, the close relationship with Apple is just another aspect that Belly can build on to better serve customers.Were excited to work with Apple to transform how retailersuse their iOS devices to drive their business forward.
