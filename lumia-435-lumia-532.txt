Microsoft has announced two new Lumia smartphones running its Windows Phone 8.1 mobile OS, both focused on beefing up the portfolio at the lower end and expanding the platforms appeal in emerging markets to try to compete with budget Androids.The Lumia 435 is the cheapest Lumia device to date, and the first 400 series device in Microsofts smartphoneline-up.Its being priced at around 69 ($81) before taxes and subsidies, bringing the platform within spitting distance of budget Androids (albeit, the lattersfloor extended below $50 last year so the race to the bottom on price is still not one Microsoft iswinning).The second new device, the$93 Lumia 532, also further squeezes the price-point for a 500 series Lumia, after Microsoft unveiledthe $140 Lumia 535,lastNovember.Microsoft said itstwo new Lumiaswill beginrolling out to key markets in Europe, APAC and IMEA thisFebruary, with bright green, bright orange, white and black color options available, along withsingle- and dual-SIM variants.Specs for the 3G Lumia 435 include a 4 inch 800 x 480 LCD display, a 1.2GHz dual-core chip, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage and a 2MP rear camera. So its certainly going to be a budget experience.The Lumia 532 has the same display and form factor but its innards are beefed up toaquad-core 1.2 GHz chip. And itsrear camera is 5MP. Microsoft toutsbuilt inSkype integration, noting itsa front-facing camera supportsvideo calls.Microsoft Office will also be pre-loaded on the devices, and Lumia 532 users activating a camera back-up feature will get 30GB of free cloud storage on Microsoft OneDrive.Microsofts Siri voice assistant competitor, Cortana, is also on board the Lumia 532 (and the 434 in select markets). So Redmond isevidently hopingto hook budget buyers onto its cloud services  to try to encourage longer term loyalty to its platform.Squeezing the Lumia price-point lower has been a project of multiple years for Microsoft, as it sought and failed to play catch up with Androids low bar. And also for Nokia, the primary Windows Phone OEM, before Redmond out and out acquired the mobile making division of the company last year.In October 2012 the cheapest Windows Phonewas the Lumia 510, which was priced ataround $199. It followed the circa $222Lumia 610 released in March that year. Both devices ran Windows Phone 7, the iteration of the platform that Microsoft orphaned in the switch to WP8.Then, in December 2012, came the cheapest Windows Phone 8 device: the $249Lumia 620 pushing the WP price-point back up a little. But by Febuary 2013 the Lumia 520 arrived to push the WP8 entry level price down to $180.Last September, after completing its acquisition of Nokias mobile making division, Microsoft released a trio of mid tier Lumias. And followed those upwiththe $140 Lumia 535. Its since addedasub-smartphone device to its line-up: the $29 Nokia 215, which is a 2G feature phone with Facebooks app pre-loaded.The Lumia 435 and 532 put Microsoftsfocus back on its budget smartphones.Itsstrategy at the very low end is to try to use Nokia-branded,non-Lumia featurephones to hook buyers onto Microsoftbranded cloud services  and presumably then hope to push them to upgrade to a Lumia smartphone down the line.However the step upfrom $29 to $81 is still a relatively bigone, given that plenty of Android devices will sit in between those two numbers, encouraging budget buyers in emerging markets to switch to Googles platform.Still, Microsoft can at least console itself that its budget smartphonesare priced and specced competitively vs Samsungs first Tizen phone, the Z1, released today  for around $92, targeting India.With many people looking to upgrade from a feature phone to a smartphone for the first time, Lumia 435 and Lumia 532 provide a balance of features and power, while also bringing Windows Phone 8.1 experiences to new price points, Microsoft notes in a press release.
