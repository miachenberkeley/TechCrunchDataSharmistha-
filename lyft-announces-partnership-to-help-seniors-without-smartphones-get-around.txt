Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have always been awesome at empowering people without viable forms of transportation to get around. A key demographic thats been left out of reaping these benefits, however, isthe nations senior citizens.Today, Lyft announced a partnership with the National MedTrans Network that will provide seniorsin NYCa simpler way to get rides to non-emergency medical appointments. To do this, the Lyft at Work team has introduced a slick-looking, third-party web application called Concierge that allows its partners to call Lyfts online onthe behalf of someone who may not have a smartphone to do it themselves.For seniors that have a tough time getting around orare maybe staying behind the wheel a little longer than they should, Lyft could be a major opportunity for them to maintain a bit more independence. Heres the problem, though: More than a quarter of Americans that are 65-plus dont own a smartphone and that percentage only increases as ages do. Apps are also generally a difficult concept for some elderly people to get used to no matter how intuitive the UI is.In a blog post, Lyft says that around 3.6 million Americans miss or have to delay medical care because they dont have the transportation to get where they need to go. With this effort, Lyft hopes to help seniors in NYC get used to the lingo their grandkids have been using when they talk about grabbing a Lyft. But more seriously it may also give Lyft an opportunity to see the full potential of Concierge, which could plausibly have major market potential as Lyft for Work looks to increase their partnerships.Lyft says itsalready fulfilling 2,500 rides a week through the service, butBilly McKee, president of National Medtrans Network, details in the blog post thathe plans to increase that number.Using transportation-as-a-service like this, the health plans and government agencies we partner with are significantly reducing fraud, saving costs, and improving the patient experience, said McKee. We provide over 25,000 livery trips per week in NYC, and our goal is to push all of those through Lyft.
