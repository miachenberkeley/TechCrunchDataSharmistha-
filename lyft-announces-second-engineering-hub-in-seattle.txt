Rideshare service Lyft announced on Tuesday it would open its first engineering office outside the Bay Area in Seattle, saying the location would give it an advantage in recruitment.Initiallyabout 20 engineers will join the Lyft Seattle office. Once a city that vexed ride-sharing companies with its strict regulations, Seattle now boasts engineering officesfor Lyft and Uber.Given Lyfts growth, its tough to recruit enough software development engineers to keep up with our growth, said Rex Tibbens, Lyfts COO. It just seemed like a good Lyft city.It fits all our culture and norms.As rent prices in the Bay Area skyrocket, Seattle is on its way to becomingthe second Silicon Valley for many prominent tech companies. Second offices there allow companies to attract engineers who want to add names like Google, Facebook and now Lyftto their resumes but avoid San Francisco and South Bays high cost of living.Once only home to the engineering offices of Microsoft and Amazon, Seattle now hosts engineeringoffices for Google,Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Salesforce, eBay, Dropbox, Uber, SpaceX, Taser,Palantir, Groupon, Hulu, Electronic Arts, Yahoo!, Pivotal Labsand many others.Ironically the companies attracted to the city for its low cost of living are driving rent pricesupand bringing the gentrification issues that have plagued San Francisco. The population is increasing quickly, and rising rent prices are pushing low-income residents to the outskirts of the city.This is the second time this week that Lyft has announced it is sprawling outside its San Francisco headquarters. The company also saidit would move some of its customer support team to Nashville, Tennessee.
