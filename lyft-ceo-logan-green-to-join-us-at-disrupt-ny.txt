The last time Lyft CEO Logan Green graced the Disrupt stage, in September 2013, the mobile ride-hailing service was a little more than a year old. Back then Lyft was available in just 10 markets, but was growing quickly thanks to an aggressive expansion roadmap that would take it into 25 U.S. cities by the end of that year.A lot has changed in the last 18 months, as Lyft has evolved from scrappy upstart to a force to be reckoned with in the burgeoning transportation market. The company has launched service in more than 65 markets, hired some serious talent to round out its executive team, and gone through a brand refresh in which it shed its signature carstache for the less obtrusive (and more friendly) glowstache.Last but not least, Lyft recently raised a huge, $530 million round of funding from Rakuten which propelled it into the league of startups with billion dollar-plus valuations.Lyft has grown, but it still faces intense competition from global transportation leader Uber  which hasnt always played nice in its fight for drivers, passengers, and market share in cities around the U.S. The company also has an uphill battle in getting local government agencies and regulators to warm up to the idea of letting drivers who arent commercially licensed to act like taxis and shuttle passengers around.Well be talking to Logan about Uber, regulation, and what its like to be dubbed a unicorn  among other things!  in a few weeks at Disrupt NY.
