Camera maker Lytro is hopping into virtual reality. Today, it announced a product called Immerge which the company describes as worlds first professional light field solution for cinematic VR.What does that mean exactly?Well Lytro wants to provide tools to shoot live action virtual reality. It built its light field solution from the ground up. Its CEO, Jason Rosenthal, says Lytro will continue to support and sell their old camera line, but theyre switching over to virtual reality, which he calls the future of the company.The rig has a sphere containing five rings of light field cameras and sensors to capture video. The key is its collecting all of the data from all directions at any given location. As a viewer, youll be able to seamlessly look up and down, side to side and the like when youre wearing a VR headset. Basically you cant move around in current VR experiences, youre in a set position. Mostly so you dont fall down.Lord knows I have.Heres some of the hottest VR production outfits discussing Lytro Immerge:Six degrees of freedom is the battle cry for Immerge.The output of the camera will be compatible with all of the big players platforms and rigs, including Oculus, HTCs and Sonys, Lytro says. Whens it coming? Well, itll be tested, and full specs will be made available, in 2016 and its probably not going to be cheap. But when you think about who will pick these cameras up, they can probably afford it and have budgeted for emerging tech like this.The company has raised $150.75M to date and doubling down on virtual reality certainly isnt a bad idea. I mean, at least theyre not re-inventing Polaroid pictures or anything. Its a pivot. But a damn smart one.
