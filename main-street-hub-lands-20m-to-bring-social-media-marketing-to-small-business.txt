They have little time to deal with modern online marketing or monitoring their Yelp page reviews. Thats where Main Street Hub comes in.For a monthly fee, Matt Stuart, co-CEO at Main Street Hub says his company does all the heavy lifting across online channels for these businesses. We deliver a combined product using existing communication channels including marketing automation, CRM, social media, reputation management and mobile, web and email marketing, Stuartexplained.Stuartlikens his company to the old Yellow Pages customer representative, who used to call on the store owner and handle all their marketing through a Yellow Pages ad. Today, potential customers are online and Main Street Hub is trying to help get those customers into the store, just as the Yellow Pages did back in the day.Using a combination of data, content and human customer support, Main Street Hub works directly with subscribersto help bring peopleinto their shops, the goalof every small business owner. They describe their content library that the company has built up over the last five years as informative, funny or engaging in some way.We help you acquire new customers by reaching out to nearby consumers who are expressing a need online for something you offer, Andrew Allison, the other co-CEO told TechCrunch.As Allison points out, a lot of small business web sites are dated and not terribly useful. Main Street Hub sends potential customers to a modern looking landing page. For instance, if someone expresses a desire for a local restaurant for lunch on Twitter, Main Street Hub is watching and will respond with a link to the business website, tuned for whatever device the person happens to be using.If the customer checks in, leaves a review on Yelp ora comment on Twitter (or takes another online action), it sees that too and may respond on behalf of the business, as appropriate.There are marketing automation tools like Marketo and Eloqua, but these tend focus on larger businesses, whereas Main Street Hub is entirely focused on small ones. Itdoescountchains and franchises among its clients, but even then the focus is at the store level, Stuartexplained.The founders began what became Main Street Hub when they were students at Stanford Business School.
