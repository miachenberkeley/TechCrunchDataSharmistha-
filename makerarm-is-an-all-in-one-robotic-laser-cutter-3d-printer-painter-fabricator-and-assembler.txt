Makerarm is a robotic 3D printer, laser cutter, drawing and ink printer, fabricator and assembly machine all rolled into one that fits on a desktop and promises to make pretty much anything  including an entire laptop (It milled us the TechCrunch logo into a block of wood instead).Glowforge, a 3D laser cutter comes close but only offers laser cutting. Makerbot brings quality 3D printing to the massesbut does not include laser cutting or the other perks included in Makerarm.The machine also claims the ability to create the kind of high-quality objects normally reserved for more expensive models that can only do one of the tasks included in Makerarm. Precision joints and high-powered lasers are built in to provide that kind of high-quality etching and carving and Makerarms 3D printer claims to possess the largest work area (under 30 diameter) among 3D printers.Co-founder Azam Shahani told TechCrunch he created Makerarmafter looking around and realizing there wasnt a good all-in-one solution for what he wanted to do. His machine works in a similar fashion to other 3D printers and laser cutters. Creators pick and load designs to the machine and Makerarm will go to work.Makerarm is up on Kickstarter, starting today. Super early birds can pre-order it for $999, but the price will go up to $2199 for a full MakerSpace bundle after that.We recently got a look at how Makerarm operates in our TechCrunch studio (hence the milled TechCrunch logo). Check out the video above with Shahani to see what this machine can do.
