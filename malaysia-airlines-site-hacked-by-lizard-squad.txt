Hacker group Lizard Squad, which took down Xbox Live and the Sony PlayStation Network last month, have claimed credit for an attack on Malaysia Airlines website. The site currently displays a picture of a lizard in a top hat and monocle, as well as the text 404-Plane Not Found (a reference to flight MH370, which disappeared in March), and Hacked by LIZARD SQUAD-OFFICIAL CYBER CALIPHATE.(Some users may see a lite version of Malaysia Airlines website as the air carrier restores access to its site).Its unclear whether or not Lizard Squad is actually linked to Cyber Caliphate, a hacker group that claims to be associated with ISIS. Last month, Cyber Caliphate took control of the U.S. central military commands Twitter and YouTube accounts.Malaysia Airlines confirmed the attack on its Facebook page:Malaysia Airlines confirms that its Domain Name System (DNS) has been compromised where users are re-directed to a hacker website whenwww.malaysiaairlines.com URL is keyed in.
At this stage, Malaysia Airlines web servers are intact.
The airline has resolved the issue with its service provider and the system is expected to be fully recovered within 22 hours.
The matter has also been immediately reported to CyberSecurity Malaysia and the Ministry of Transport.
Malaysia Airlines assures customers and clients that its website was not hacked and this temporary glitch does not affect their bookings and that user data remains secured.In a tweet, however, Lizard Squad (which itself was hacked last week) claimed it had materials taken from Malaysia Airlines servers. It has already shared a screenshot of an inbox with passenger itineraries.Going to dump some loot found on http://t.co/D9XYneQoaK servers soon Lizard Squad (@LizardMafia) January 26, 2015Weve contacted Malaysia Airlines for more information.
