Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been talking for a while now about how mobile, video, native advertising, and social are the companys key growth areas. Now shes come up with an interesting way to refer to them  MaVeNS.I dont know how you feel, but personally, Im not convinced that its, um, the best acronym ever. I mean, the unusual capitalization is certainly, hmmmm, bold, as is using Ma to stand for mobile and Ve for video. I admit that mobvins doesnt have quite the same ring to it, but I guess Id be more impressed if all those contortions had resulted in a better word.Nonetheless, Mayer soldiered on with her attempt to make MaVeNS a thing, repeatedly using the acronym during todays fourth quarter earnings call with analysts. For example, when discussingthe 4 percent decline in display ad revenue, she said that the strong growth in our MaVeNS business will eventually offset the loss in traditional display, later adding, The MaVeNS businesses are not cannibalistic to traditional PC advertising.Mayeralso claimed that if MaVeNS were broken out from Yahoos other businesses, they would be one of the fastest-growing startups in the world. The earnings report, thankfully, doesnt call them MaVeNS, but it says that mobile, video, native, and social are Yahoos Transformative Investments and accounted for $380 million in GAAP revenue during the most recent quarter,as well as $1.1 billion for all of 2014. (GAAP search revenue for the fourth quarter was $467 million and display revenue was $532 million.)So there you have it. When Mayer said that shes working to return an iconic company to greatness, shes talking about MaVeNS.(By the way, theres a maven in Yahoos past, too  Maven Networks, an ad company that Yahoo acquired in 2008, before shuttering the product a year later.)
