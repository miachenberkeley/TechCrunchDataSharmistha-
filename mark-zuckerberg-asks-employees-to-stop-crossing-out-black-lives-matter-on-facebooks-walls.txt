Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is asking his employees to stop being ignorant and racist (my words, not his).In an internal memo obtained by Gizmodo, Zuckerberg said he was disappointed by the several recent instances of people crossing out black lives matter and writing all lives matter on the walls at MPK. MPK, one of Facebooks buildings in Menlo Park, Calif., has a wall reminiscent of the early days of Facebook for employees to write their thoughts.Heres the memo, courtesy of Gizmodo:Facebook is a notoriously white place.In the U.S. last year, Facebook hired 36 black people and 73 Hispanic people, compared to 603 white people,according to its 2014 EEO1 report. In total, only 2 percent of Facebooks workforce is black, 3 percent of it is Hispanic and  no surprises here  55 percent of Facebook is white.In addition to the fact that this is terrible, its especiallyeffed-up timing given that its Black History Month and given the fact that severalAfrican-American studentsfrom the San Francisco Bay Area are planning a trip to Facebook tomorrow.As Zuckerberg noted, Facebook is investigating the incidents and is encouraging employees to participate in anupcoming town hall at Facebook to learn what Black Lives Matter is all about. Ive reached out to Facebook, but the company declined to comment further.
