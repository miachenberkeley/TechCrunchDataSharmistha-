Marriott, recently in the news for attempting to block private hotspots, is working to offer familiar entertainment via their in-room video systems.Marriott International is testing out new in-room entertainment in eight hotels across its chain (which is, admittedly, a relatively small test considering the chain operates more than 4,000 properties in over eighty countries) that includes the ability to watch Netflix, Hulu, or listen to Pandora from the high-def television in the room.The hospitality company says that its part of an effort to renew the idea of in-room entertainment, and if offering Netflix means we dont have to sift through the glitchy, slow world of LodgeNet, its a win-win for the consumer.Its unclear which method Marriott will use to deliver this content to consumers.We have invited leading technology companies and content providers to work with us to design the next wave in in-room entertainment focusing on on-demand programming, John Wolf, a spokesman for Marriott told Bloomberg. We are currently offering guests in eight test hotels the opportunity to stream their content through our high-definition TVs whether it is Netflix, Hulu or Pandora.The report suggests that users would be able to pay for Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora access as a premium tier in their WiFi package at the hotel, but its unclear if users who already subscribe to these streaming services will have to pay extra to watch on the TV instead of their tablet or laptop.
