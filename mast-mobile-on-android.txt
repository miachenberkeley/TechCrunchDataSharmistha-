Communication startup Mast Mobileis launching on Android  specifically the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge.The news is part of a broader partnership with Samsung, which has made a minority investment of undisclosed size in the company. In addition, Mast said its launching the first commercial integration with the Samsung Knox Cloud SDK, which provides device security.TechCrunchs John Biggs has compared Mast to a mullet, which sounds insane but is actually a prettyaccurate description  as John put it, it offers business up front and a party in the back.In other words, Mastallows you to receive calls from both your personal number and your work number on one phone. That means you dont need to give out your personal phone number in a work context, and you can also see which number people are calling for and respond accordingly.Mast CEO David Messenger (previously an executive at Virgin Mobile USA) told mehes trying to create a new model for businesses but also individuals to manage their communications.Messenger argued that beyond the personal use case (which could be particularly tempting for freelancers and other participants in the gig economy), there are big reasonsfor entire companiesto adopt Mast, with features like PBX support and the ability to automatically log work calls in your companys sales database.Mast will even provide phonesif necessary, although Messenger said that when the company is reselling mobile network access or renting out devices, its doing so at-cost: Our business model is all about the software license.
