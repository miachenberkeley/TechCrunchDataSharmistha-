Okay, so the fact that MasterCard is hosting aseries of hackathons might not seem terribly exciting  even if we grant that the name Masters of Code is kind clever, it seems like every big company is going after the startup/developer crowd with a hackathon of its own.What is impressive, however, is the scale of MasterCards efforts. Throughout the course of the year, the company plans to hold 14 events in 11 countries. To organize them, its partnering with AngelHack  Chief Marketing Officer Brian Collins said its one of the largest partnerships AngelHack is working on to date.So far, MasterCard has held events in Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong; Singapore; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Tel Aviv, Israel. Next up: Mexico City and San Francisco in August. Mario Shiliashki, MasterCards senior vice president of its open API, and Chief Developer Evangelist Sebastien Taveau are traveling to each hackathon (which sounds a little tiring, to be honest).Shiliashki said this is MasterCards first standalone hackathon series, and Taveau added thats its a global competition, Taveau because, We are looking at what will be the next generation of commerce applications  That new generation can come from anywhere in the world.The overallwinner will receive $100,000 and be admitted into MasterCards Start Path accelerator. There are prizes for the runners up too, andeven if they dont turn into real products, they help MasterCard get the word about its APIs.For example, the most recent winner was WEBusking in Tel Aviv (pictured above), which used MasterCards Simplify Commerce API to build an online platform for busking  namely, for performing and receiving small payments from your users.Shiliashkisaidthe hackathons also help MasterCard explore a future where its more than just a card company.As we now move into this world of connected devices, we firmly believe that the MasterCardplatforms and products are much morebroadly applicable, he said. Any connecteddevice has the potential to be a commerce device.
