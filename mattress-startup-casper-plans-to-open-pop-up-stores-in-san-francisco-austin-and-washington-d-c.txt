Casper is known for  bringing the mattress-buying experience online, but its also trying out new approaches to brick-and-mortar retail. In fact, co-founder and CEO Philip Krim said that over the next two months, the startup will be opening pop-up stores in San Francisco, Austin and Washington, D.C.Krim revealed his plans while on-stage at our Disrupt NY conference  and yes, the interview actually happened yesterday, but I imagine that some of you missed his comments because the event live stream was down. (Its not my fault, I swear.)Whats the point of opening up these physical locations? (The company already has showrooms in New York City and Los Angeles.) Well, Krim repeatedly described them as experiments.TechCrunchs Jon Shieber also asked about how the companys mattresses might evolve, particularly by incorporating more technology. Krim replied that hes interested in how different devices might connect sleep tracking to actually influencing and improving how you sleep, but it sounds like this is still very speculative: Its definitely something we like talking about and thinking about.Update: You can learn more about the Snoozebars here.
