Mavrck, a startup that helps marketers recruit customers to create promotional content, has raised $5 million in Series A funding.There are plenty of other companies working on influencer marketing, but Mavrck co-founder and CEO Lyle Stevens said they usually identify influencers without helping brands activate them, or theyre focused on how to rent influencers, regardless of whether or not they have any actual loyalty to a specific brand or product.Mavrck, in contrast, allows brands to work with what it calls micro-influencers who are already part oftheir customer base.We are seeing a drastic expansion in the types of influencers, their use cases and the scalability of influencer marketing as it becomes more automated, Stevens told me via email. Traditional insta-famous bloggers or YouTube stars were managed via spreadsheets and used in one-off campaigns to help drive brand awareness. We are now seeing everyday consumers with highly engaged friend circles being used in an always on methodology to help with a range of business objectives including customer acquisition, loyalty/retention and consumer insights.The Series A comes from Kepha Partners and GrandBanks Capital,bringing the startups total funding to $8.3 million. In the funding release, Kepha founder and partner Jo Tango highlighted Mavrcks ability to drive measurable conversions on social and deliver authentic, targeted audience engagement independent of ad-blocking software and changes to social networks algorithms.Mavrck wasincubated at TechStars Boston.
