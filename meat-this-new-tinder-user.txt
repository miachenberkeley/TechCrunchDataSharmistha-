Before we get too far into this, I want to be fully transparent and disclose up-front that this is weird and mostly irrelevant. Inexplicably, Vimeo user Marcello Gmez Maureira has created a video that shows a piece of meat power-right-swiping through Tinder. The title of the film? Tender: Its how people meat. So, naturally, I love Marcello and this video. A few fun jokes you could use to caption this as you inevitably share it with your social networks:Tinder sure is a meat market! (Stolen from BoingBoing, just like the video.)Ooh baby, I like it raw! (Stolen from ODB.)People on Tinder just treat you like a piece of meat. (Unfortunately, not stolen. Im just not that funny.) Something about being forced to upgrade to Tinder Plus. (Im really bad at this.)I told you this would be weird. Sorry. Carry on.
