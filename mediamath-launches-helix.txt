Theres a lot of talk about using data to power programmatic advertising, but according to MediaMath CEO Joe Zawadzki, the reality hasnt lived up to all the hopes and dreams. Thats something hes hoping to change, partly through todays launch of MediaMaths new Helix business unit.Well, not entirely new. Its built on top of MediaMaths Adroit Shopper Co-op, which the company acquired from Akamai. In fact, the technology has changed hands a few times  as Helix President Jacob Ross put it, Different owners have invested in it for a decade.However, Zawadzki said that in the three years since the acquisition, MediaMath has been replatforming it in a couple of different dimensions and integrating it with MediaMaths ad-buying tools and data  now its unveiling the results of that work. The company says Helix allows marketers to use anonymizedshoppingdata from hundreds of members, including one-third of the 100 largest retailers in the US, which marketers can then use to target their ads.MediaMath throws off a lot of data exhaust in the way that they generate marketing, Ross said. Were combining that data asset that MediaMath has with the shopper co-op to create a holistic profile of a consumer.MediaMath has already been testing the platform with some advertisers, including Pep Boys, which praised Helix for allowing it to reach a much wider pool of shoppers. Pep Boys said its already seeing improved campaign performance.While Helix is only launching in the United States today, Ross said the plan is to make it available to all global MediaMath clients.
