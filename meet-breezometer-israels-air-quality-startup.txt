Ziv Lautman, BreezoMeters co-founder, also explains that there is potential to provide air quality data with to a persons doctor, and help with better medical advice.While BreezoMeter is already working with municipalities and smart cities companies, there is an increasing demand for solutions to enable better analysis, and thus facilitate actionable steps to be taken to combat air pollution in cities, Lautman said in a statement announcing his companys funding.The company already offers its air quality data through an API. Also in June, BreezoMeter launched its iOS App, a twin version of the Android app that was released a year ago.Real estate companies are interested in the data.

After carbon trading failed to launch on a large scale, Breezometer may provide another way of economically quantifying the impact of air pollution.Breezometers quantified-self health and well-being solution could catalyze the type of working example needed to take action out of the hands of government, and empower citizens directly, according to Charles Wright, a climate researcher and ecologist.An activist working in Australia,Wrightsays that if we wait on governments, well wait forever. We need groups to voluntarily opt for sustainable energy systems. For example, cities, companies and districts. Once its proven to work, it will be less intimidating for communities to decide to go green, Wright said.
