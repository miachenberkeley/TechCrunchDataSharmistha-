Today, we are thrilled to introduce the Hardware Battlefield 2016 participants. These startups represent what we at TechCrunch feel are the most interesting, most promising early-stage hardware companies being built. Whether drones, connected homes, custom wearables, robots or even sports are your fancy, weve got you covered with this batch.Over the past month these companies have been working tirelessly to push that last run off the manufacturing line, get approved by the app store and prep their crowdfunding campaigns. Theyll have the chance to showcase all their hard work onstage in front of our expert panel of judges. This year, those experts include Mark Fields, CEO of Ford; Helen Greiner, Founder/CEO of CyPhy Works; Matt Turck of First Mark Capital; and Susan Paley, Innovation Expert of General Motors.Well be running three straight days of exciting presentations live from the Sands Lobby.
