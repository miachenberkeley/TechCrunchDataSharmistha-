Line, the Japanese messaging company, has continued its flurry ofnew app and service launchesafter it released an Android launcher app.Launcher apps essentially take central control of an Android device, allowing a user to customize its look, feel and usage. Facebook is among others to offer such an app, and Lines  whichwas actually initially run by its Camp Mobile division, but has been rebranded as Line and updated with new features  lets users put stickers ontheir wallpaper and edit the appearance of app icons, while it includeswidget shortcuts, utility apps and anintegrated search feature.The Line launcher also recommends apps for download for its users and has souped up notifications for the core Line chat app. Right now it doesnt seem to have too much integration with the latter service, but wed expect thingsto become more optimized with future updates.The company, which is reported to have again delayed plans to go public this year following disappointing financial results of late, has been on a new release spree, after introducing a location-sharing app, keyboard app, lightweight chat app, andgroup calling appto unbundle some of its services in a bid to attract new users.An Android launcher app makes absolute sense because, not only does it potentially help Line reach people who dont make use of its messaging app  which counts half of its active user base in just three countries: Japan, Taiwan and Thailand  but it could help the services more active users become even more active.Line had originally set out to become a global messaging app, but after running into difficulties growing its popularity in the West, the company is tightening its focus on Asia primarily. It is also pushing itself as a lifestyle platform, not just a messaging utility. To that end it has a fund to invest in online-to-offline services, as well as music, taxi and payment servicesof its own that hook into the Line chat app.
