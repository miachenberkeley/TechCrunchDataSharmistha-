Chinas Xiaomi outed its latest smartphone, the Mi Note, yesterday, and we briefly managed to get our mitts on the 5.7-inch screen device.As the first phablet in Xiaomis flagship Mi family, it is pretty easy to make a comparison with the iPhone 6+. Indeed, CEO Lei Jun did compare the specs of the two phones during the launch event, but there are plenty ofdifferences between the two.The Mi Note uses curved glass to give it graceful edges, the phone actually has glass fronts on both sides, and its camera  which sports an OIC doesnt stick out as it does on the Apple device. Theres also a whopping 3,000mAhbattery to help the phone last as long as possible, though we havent had a chance to do a takeaway review of its capacity at this point.The Mi Note feels great in the hand. This phone is seriously wafer thin at just6.95mm thick and 161g in weight, but yet the build quality is sturdy.At2,299 CNY ($370) for a 16GB model and 2,799 (circa $450) for the 64GB version, the device adheres to Xiaomis super-competitive approach to price  even the specced up Mi Note Pro will retail for3,299 CNY ($535), thats roughly half the cost of a top of the range iPhone 6+ unlocked.Theres no word on when the new devices will appear in overseas markets at this point. Xiaomi sells its phones in sevencountries, but it has plans to expand that number in 2015, most likely to Brazil, Turkey, Russia and other parts of Southeast Asia. If youre not living in those places, youre limited tomarveling at these phones from afar, unfortunately.Bonus photos: Xiaomi also revealeda new set of $80 headphones. Dont expect to see them sold outside of China soon/perhaps ever though.
