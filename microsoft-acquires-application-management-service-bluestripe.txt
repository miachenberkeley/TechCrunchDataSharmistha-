Microsoft today announced that it has acquiredBlueStripe, an application management service that helps enterprisesmonitor and troubleshoot applications that have been deployed across different operating systems, data centers and cloud environments. Microsoft says it will integrate the service into tools like System Center and the companys Operations Management Suite(OMS).As Microsoft notes, many of BlueStripes customers already use BlueStripes productsto extend Microsofts own OMS to gain better insight into their infrastructures performance.Microsoft will stop selling BlueStripe soon, as it starts to incorporate the service into its own products, but the company tells me that it will still support BlueStripes existing customers until then.The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. According to CrunchBase, BlueStripe raised $13.5 million since it was founded in 2007. The last round was a $525,000debt financing round in July 2014. Investors in the companys $5 million Series A and $8 million Series B roundsinclude Trinity Ventures and Valhalla Partners.According to Microsoft, BlueStripe helpsenterprises monitor their IT at the infrastructure level so they can automatically discover and map the applicationsrunning on their networks and their dependencies. This makes it easier for IT to help maintain service level objectives because the admins will be able to quickly figure out where the issues are and why they are happening.We have worked with Microsoft for years  theyve been a great customer, a technology supporter, and IT management partner, the BlueStripe team writes on its homepage today. Going forward, you will see BlueStripes technology play an even more important role as new data center and cloud solutions come to market. We are thrilled with the opportunity to be part of the next wave of IT innovation.For Microsoft, todays acquisition is yet another in a series moves the company has lately executed to help enterprises run and manage their hybrid clouds. As evidenced through our recent announcements such as Microsoft Azure Stack, OMS, Windows Server 2016 and System Center 2016, Microsoft is committed to providing leading hybrid cloud solutions and support for our customers, Microsofts general manager for enterprise cloud Mike Neil writes today (though we hear that Azure Stack, which is meant to bring some Azure services into any data center, is still more promise than reality at this point).Todays acquisition furthers that promise, giving IT even more hybrid cloud flexibility to focus on what matters most rapidly delivering business value to drive innovation.
