Microsoft today announced that it has acquired VoloMetrix, a service that specializes in analyzing organizational performance using anonymized data it gathers from across a companys corporate communications systems.Organization analytics is something Microsoft itself has been looking at, too, and itsDelve organizational analytics serviceis currently in preview and scheduled for general release by the end of the year.VoloMetrix, which launched in 2011, had previously raised about $17 million in funding rounds led by Split Rock Partners and Shasta Ventures.The company closed itsSplit Rock-led $12 million Series B round last October. At the time, the companys CEO Ryan Fuller told me that it was seeing tremendous traction in customers using the product to increase sales productivity by deepening their understanding of sales activities and customer relationships, and using it for organizational simplification by understanding the cost of processes, meetings andbureaucracyin their businesses.In todays announcement, Fuller saysthat joining Microsoft will be a huge win for our customers as we provide even better solutions going forward. Similarly, Microsoft saysthat this acquisition will combine VoloMetrix experience, technology and track record of success with Office 365 and our previously announced Delve Organizational Analytics.Its unclear whether Microsoft plans to fully integrate VoloMetrix into its own Delve product or if it will continue to operate as a standalone product. We have asked Microsoft for clarification and will update this post once we hear back.Update: and here is what a Microsoft spokesperson told us about the companys plans for the future of VoloMetrix: Microsoft plans to integrate the VoloMetrix solution into Delve Organizational Analytics service that the company announced at Ignite and is currently under development. They expect to launch an early preview program for Delve Organizational Analytics within the next month, and general availability of the initial release of the integrated Office 365 service by the end of this calendar year.
