In a blog post published this morning, Microsofts Joseph Sirosh, corporate vice president at Microsoft, who isin charge of Azure ML, announced the public preview of the Azure Data Catalog, an in-house tool to facilitatediscovery of a companys data sources.AzureML is Microsofts machine learning platform, which was launched last February. As companiescreate various data repositories, it becomes more challengingfor interested parties such as analysts and data scientists to understand what data sources exist in a large organization.The purpose of the data catalog, which is a cloud service managed by Microsoft, is to provide a way to identify the sources, and then search for them in an organized fashion.Users register their sources with the servicesdata source registration tool. It extractsstructural metadata  data about the data source such as attribute names and data types. While the metadata is copied to the catalog in the cloud, the source of the data remains in place on premises or in the cloud, depending on where its stored.Once its in the catalog, other employees can find it using keyword searching, filtering and other search techniques. Other userscaneven annotate a source listingwith additional informationin acrowd sourced kind of approach. As people add more information such as tags or alternative names, it should in theory help others who come after better understand itspurpose.Once employees finds a source they like, the tool enables them to connect directlyfrom the catalog to their favorite data visualization tools orto a data tool to work directly with it.Microsoft is offering this service to make it easier to discover data sources, but there will be instances when certain onesshouldnt be publicly available to all employees. It is offering an upgraded version of the catalog, which enables companies to control access in those sensitive data stores.It appears that Microsoft is using the same template it used for the public data marketplace it announced last February for the data catalog.The servicewill be available as apublic preview beginning on Monday next week.
