Microsoft is now selling Red Hat Enterprise Linux licenses. Starting today, you will be able to deploy Red Hat Linux Enterprise (RHLE) from the Azure Marketplaceand get support for your deployments from both Microsoft and Red Hat.In addition, Microsoft today announced that it is now offering certified Bitnami images in the Azure Marketplace and it now supports Walmarts (yes  that Walmarts) open source OneOps application lifecycle management platform. Until today, OneOps onlyoffered a machine image for Amazons AWS platform.Seeing the words Microsoft and Linux together in a single sentence may still come as a shock to a few people, but Microsoft says more than 60 percent of images in the Azure Marketplace are now Linux-based.Red Hat and Microsoft also previously announced the partnership that resulted in todays release, so the fact that you can now spin upRHEL virtual machines on Azure shouldnt come as a complete surprise.Its also worth noting that RHEL users were already able to port their existing licenses over to Azure, but now anybody will be able to spin up a RHEL machine on Azure (for an additional price on top of the standardcost of the basic virtual machine) and get full support from Microsoft and Red Hat.As Red HatsMike Ferris, its senior director for business architecture, and Microsofts director of program management for Azure Corey Sanders told me earlier this week, the two companies are also working closely together on supporting customers who choose to go the RHEL route on Azure.Red Hat and Microsofts support specialists are actually sitting together to answer their customers questions, which is a first for both companies.Since we announced our partnership in November, weve seen strong interest and momentum from our customers looking to bring their Red Hat investments to Azure, Sanders said in todays announcement. Azure provides the best Enterprise-grade support of the public cloud, by offering a fully integrated support experience with co-located Red Hat and Microsoft support engineers sitting side-by-side to help you when you need it!RHEL 6.7 and 7.2 images are now available inall Azure regions, with the exception of China and Azures US Government platform.While the deepened partnership with Red Hat is clearly the highlight of todays announcement, certifying a first set of Bitnami images alsogives Azure customers quite a bit more flexibility. Microsoft says it will add more of these to the Azure Marketplace in the coming months.
