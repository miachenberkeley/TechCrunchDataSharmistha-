Microsoft dropped a new Windows 10 build for all its testers today. The new code, build 10240, is the same version that was rumored this morning to be the build that Microsoft will release to OEMs.In a comment to TechCrunch, Microsoft managed to not deny the rumor, while using a bundle of words to say very little:This build is the latest Windows 10 build, and well continue to update Windows 10 code as we head toward launch and beyond. We are embracing a new way to deliver Windows.What the company means is that it will update Windows 10 today, next week, at launch, and then on a continuing basis. Still, the company is being coy regarding whether or not build 10240 is what would normally be called the RTM build. If I had to bet, Id wager that it is. Microsoft could have one more in the tank, perhaps.Regardless, this build matters as it is likely eitherthe RTM build, or something very close to it. Therefore, we can use it as a measuring stick for how far along Windows 10 has managed to come to date. If it lacks, Windows 10s launch could be a buggy affair.Regardless of whether you are in the fast or slow Insider ring, you can get the build now. Hit up Windows Update for the new goodies.The company didnt announce too much about the build, other than touting a few performance numbers from Edge, its new browser.Its two weeks today until we have Windows 10 in our mitts for real. Start the countdown.
