Microsoft has yet to ship its first HoloLens holographic imaging device,but it is moving swiftly on to the next generation of development nonetheless. TechCrunch has confirmed thatMicrosofthas dismissed60 peoplein Israel who workon the HoloLens  30 full-time staff and 30 contractors. Theplan is to winddown work onits VR headset and platform in the country andshift development to adifferenttechnology in the U.S.The news was initiallyreported in Israeli publication Ynet (in Hebrew), and we have confirmed the details alsodirectly with Microsoft:We continually evaluate our business needs and recently made decisions affecting some positions in one of our groups in Israel, a spokesperson notes in a statement provided to TechCrunch in response to questions about the layoffs. As needed, we increase investments in some areas and de-invest in others which results in the movement of jobs across the organization, and at times, job eliminations. Our priority is to work with and support employees affected by this decision.HoloLens development in Israel up to now hasbeenbased around a team of engineers and others who joined Microsoft after it acquired an Israeli startup called 3DV Systems in 2009. At the time, themove was seen as a way of enhancing the companys as-yet unreleased Kinect motion-sensing devices for gaming and computing.However,Microsoft disputed that interpretation, and indeed the eventual development of the HoloLens underscored that it had more in store for the talent and tech that it picked up reportedly for $35 million.But things have moved on it seems. Its not clear why Microsoft isshifting to a different technology, nor which technology that may be.If Microsoft is using any third party technology  similar to how itworked with PrimeSense on Kinect before it was acquired by Apple  oneguess might be Magic Leap, a startup in Florida that has attracted a lot of attention after raisingnearly $600 million to develop its own (still being developed)technologies.MagicLeapisbacked by Microsoft rival Google and its founder hasactually publicly dissedthe HoloLens in the past  two points that couldcount against it working with Microsoft. However, a recent report about yet more Magic Leap fundraising, to the tune of $1 billion, noted that the startup has dropped hints about working on a souped-up version of Google Glass or the HoloLens, so something may yet brew up betweenthe companies.(Also Microsoft and Google have co-invested before, in Uber and Cloudflare as two examples.)Magic Leap would not comment on whether it was working on the HoloLens or anything else, or provide any information about the reported new investment. Magic Leap is working on Magic Leap, a source close to the company said.On the other hand, Microsoft has also been hard at work on developing HoloLens in the U.S., and perhaps to offset any news trickling out of Israel, the company yesterday just happened to post some of the recent progress from the group in Redmond.SO excited to share a taste of the supersecret HoloLens world Ive been living in! #MadeWithHoloLens #HoloLensHYPE! pic.twitter.com/Yu5vy4RdmV Andrea Chang (@TheSparkly) November 28, 2015WithMicrosoft failing so farto build a successful smartphone business, the company continues to lookfor the big thing that coulddefine thenext generation of computing. And in that context, whether development is in-house or with a third-party, it feelslike Microsofthas a lotriding on HoloLens being a big hit, and working beautifully.Microsoft first announced the HoloLens in January this yearto lots of fanfare, and since then there have beencareful updates chartingits progress.They have included taking a small group of journalists (including our own Frederic Lardinois) on a demo that includedbuilding an app for the device; a timeline and price ($3,000) for the first developer kits; sending a HoloLens into space for NASAs use; andworking with Volvoon car-buying applications and with Autodesk on industrial design applications. There is also talk that Microsoftwill work with Asus on a low-cost version of augmented reality glasses.We have reached out to Microsoft for more detail and well update as we learn more.
