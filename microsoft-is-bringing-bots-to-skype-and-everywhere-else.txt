Microsofts recently launched, A.I.-powered bot Tay may have embarrassed the company when Twitter users taught the machine how to be racist, but Microsoft hasnt given up on the future of bot development. Its just getting started. At Microsoftsannual Build conference in San Francisco today, CEOSatya Nadella unveiled the companys plans to bring the world of bots to conversational platforms  meaning not only Skype, but also other communications toolslike Slack, Outlook, LINE, and more.News of the bots unveiling was previously reported by Bloomberg, but todaysonstage demonstrations revealed how bots, including Microsofts own virtual assistant Cortana, aim tohelp pave the way for the future of communication, productivity, and interactions withbusinesses and brands.In Skype, the company showed off rich Cortana integration which put the assistant directly into the app where she could help users do things like identify the persons, places and things in your messages, underline them, and then display more info in a card-like interface when clicked.She is also able to help you perform a variety of tasks, like adding items to your calendar, booking travel or hotel rooms, or even pre-populating conversations to friends with text.Whats interesting about Cortanas integration in Skype is how it has a larger understanding of everything youre chatting about and doing  its not just focused on the single task at hand.For example, in the demo shown today, Cortana was able to figure out that the user was attending a conference referenced in a personal chat with co-worker, block calendar and travel time for the event, and then even proactively introduce a hotel bot into the conversation to suggest hotel rooms.The Westin bot, then, popped up, displayed a variety of room choices with image thumbnails and pricing. In two steps, the hotel room was booked and the information was added to the users calendar automatically.And because Cortana understands a usersconnections, she also suggested that the user message a friend who lived in the city  and even helpfully wrote some of the message text to the friend on the users behalf.The botsintegration in Skype is rolling out todayon Windows, iOS and Android as a preview. This includes a way for users to test Skype Bots and offer feedback.As a side note, Skype for Hololenswent live today, too, but without bot integration.ThoughCortana is Microsofts leading bot, its just one example of the future of bots, in Microsofts vision. The company also unveiled a larger agenda aimed at helping developers build their own bots for Skype and elsewhere.The company launched the first-ever Skype Bot SDK, which lets brands, businesses and other third parties create their own bots that can work on Skype, seamlessly integrating into users chats. These arent just text bots, as many of the SMS-based virtual assistance startups weve seen so far Skype bots can introduce both audio and video experiences, the company said.One example of this is Skype Video Bots, which offer a different take on video calling  basically, you can Skype call a bot in a virtual environment.For Microsoft, bots arent just a handy featureto help get more people using Skype, or taking advantage of its Bing-powered assistant Cortana. Skype is used by over 300 million connected users each month, the company reminded conference attendees, but the potential for bots scalesfar beyond Skypesuser base.According toNadella, bots are the nextapplications  and they make using technology to interact with businesses and services easier for many users who are confounded by the numerous mobile apps available today, or who are frustrated bynavigating the endless sea of websites. Bots work better because you simply talk to them, using natural language.We want to take that power of human language and apply it more pervasively to all of the computing interfaces and computing interactions, he explained. Bots are like new applications that you converse with  youre not really looking for multiple applications, or pages and pages of websites, he said.Nadellathen introduced the Microsoft Bot Framework, which lets developers build intelligent bots that work anywhere users are  text/SMS, Skype, Slack, Office 365 email, and more.The company isalso launching a bot directory, giving usa briefpeek at a few bots it had created itself. This includes a BuildBot which helps attendeesnavigate the conference itself; a Bing News bot and another Bing Image bot, both thathelp you navigate the web with bots; a caption bot which understands images; and a Bing Music bot that search for YouTube, Vevo, LyricFind and more for songs.Bots represent a huge opportunity to write new types of applications, Nadella told developers, adding that bots will be core  like .NET was  to all apps going forward.Preview Bots are available now inthe latest versions of Skype for Windows Desktop,Android, iPhone and iPad. Skypes Developer Platform and bot creation tools are here.And the Microsoft Bot Framework is here.
