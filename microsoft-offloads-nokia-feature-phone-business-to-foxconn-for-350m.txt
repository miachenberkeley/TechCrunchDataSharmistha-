Microsoft is selling the feature phone business it acquired from Nokia back in 2013to a subsidiary of Taiwan-headquarteredmanufacturer Foxconn for $350 million, it announced today.At the same timeformer owner Nokia saidit has inked a deal to license its brand to HMD Global, a new Finnish company run by ex-Nokia and Microsoft devices staff,to create a new generation of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets.So, er, the Nokia phone is dead, long live the Nokia phoneEntry level issuesFeature phones  aka more basic mobile devices that are not considered to be fully fledged smartphones  never looked like a comfortable fit for Microsoft, which shelled out some $7.2 billion to acquire Nokias entire mobile devices business aroundthree years ago in the hopes of firing up the fortunes of its smartphone OSplatform, then called Windows Phone.That strategy has also faltered, with Microsoft failing to carve out a significant share for Windows Phone in a market dominated by Android (in volume terms) and iOS (for premium/profits). Although it reiteratedtoday that it will continueto develop its Windows 10 Mobile platform, and to support Lumia-branded smartphones (such as the Lumia 650, Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL) along with phones from OEM partners such asAcer, Alcatel, HP, Trinity and VAIO.Holding onto a diminishing feature phones business clearly did nothold much appeal for Redmond which  despite its talk of continued development of its own smartphone platform  has been focusing its efforts on building up aservices offering via apps made for Android and iOS devices. Last month, for example, it brought its Word Flow keyboard app, originally developed, for Windows over to iOS as an app.With itsfocus shifting to rivalssmartphone platforms, where the users are, there was clearly little incentiveforthe company to maintain Nokias old feature phones business,especially as the market for so-called dumb phones continues to shrink as Android further squeezes the price of entry levelsmartphones.In prior years Microsoft had suggestedfeature phones might be able toact as an on-boarding ramp for phone users to encounter itsservices and be encouraged to upgrade to a Windows based smartphone. However that notion never looked likely to fly. And indeed, even the very modest sales of Windows smartphones have further collapsed this year. Andthe companys phone revenue declined 49 per cent in its Q2 2016 results back in January.Microsoft has also specifically been winding down the feature phones business for almost two years. Back in July 2014 an internal memo obtained by the media noted thatallmobile phones-related services would beimmediately moved intomaintenance mode, and  over an 18 months period  shut down.As it turns out Microsoft has taken the option to sell the feature phones division instead of closing it, clawing back a little of the cash ithanded over to buy Nokia.While Nokia gets to re-enter the mobile phonesmarket as a brand licensee.Nokia branded phones and tabletsTheagreement Microsofthas reached will see the feature phones unit and assets sold to FIH Mobile, a subsidiary of the Foxconn Technology Group. While HMD global  the newly formed Finnish company thats bringing the Nokia brand back to mobile devicesis acquiring the right to usethe Nokia brand on feature phones, and certain related design rights, with the aim of becoming the sole global licensee for all types of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets, it said today.When Nokia sold its mobile division to Microsoft it gave up the right to use its brand name on devices, but only until this yearwhen that clause in the deal expired. Its now evidently formulated its strategy to return to the devices market, having previously signaled it was looking for the right partner to do so.Asked about this back in February Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri told TechCrunch:We think its a good business model because the Nokia brand has great retention  the recognition of the brand is still very high in all the major markets. We also think that if there will be a product with the Nokia brand on it theres an opportunity for premium on that product  clear price premium  suggesting HMD will be offering high end handsets and tablets, as well as feature phones.Nokia couched itsagreement with HMD today as a strategic deal. The deal gives HMDan exclusive global license (excluding Japan)to create Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets for the next ten years. Nokia Technologies will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales ofNokia-branded mobile products, covering both brand and intellectual property rights.Nokiahadalready been testing abrand licensing strategy in mobile devices, working with Foxconn on an Android based tablet, the N1, for the Asian market back in 2015. The HMD deal clearly putsits licensing strategy ona more formal and sustained footing. A Nokia spokesperson confirmed it will no be involved in the design of HMD Nokia-branded devices, telling TechCrunch: HMD will be responsible for product creation, including design.For its part HMD said it intends to invest more than$500 million over the next three years to support the global marketing of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets, funded via its investors and (what it hopes are) profits from the acquired feature phone business.HMD  another AndroidOEMAs well as planning to sell Nokia-branded feature phones, HMD said today that it will also haveasmartphone and tablet portfolio based on Android  returning the Nokia brand to Android handsets(a strategy Nokia had begun just prior to the closing of its acquisition byMicrosoft, and which Microsoft subsequently shuttered Truly, all that is old is new again. And again ).Nokia noted today that is not making a financial investment or holding equity in HMD but its Nokia Technologies division will take a seat on the HMD Board of Directors, as well as setting mandatory brand requirements and performance related provisions  to ensure that all Nokia-branded products live up to itsquality and design standards. After all, the brand is the only mobile asset for Nokia at this point so it needs to ensure no one (else) poisons the well.As part of the Microsoft feature phone sale deal, Microsoft noted thatsome4,500 employees will transfer to, or have the opportunity to join, FIH Mobile or HMD Global  shedding what is likely the remaining rump of Nokia staff Microsoft originally acquired (after prior job cutsas it was unable to move the needle on mobile devicesales).FIH Mobile will also acquire Microsoft Mobile Vietnam  the companys Hanoi, Vietnam, manufacturing facility, Microsoftadded.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.Once the Microsoft transaction closes HMD will be led by Arto Nummela, who previously held senior positions at Nokia and is currently the head of MicrosoftsMobile Devicesbusiness for Greater Asia, Middle East and Africa, as well as itsglobal Feature Phones business.HMDs president on closing would be Florian Seiche, currently Senior Vice President for Europe Sales and Marketing at Microsoft Mobile, and who previously held key roles at Nokia, HTC and other global brands.Commenting on the impending return of the Nokia brand to the mobile market,Ramzi Haidamus, president of Nokia Technologies, dubbed it an exciting new chapter, adding in a statement:Instead of Nokia returning to manufacturing mobile phones itself, HMD plans to produce mobile phones and tablets that can leverage and grow the value of the Nokia brand in global markets. Working with HMD and FIH will let us participate in one of the largest consumer electronics markets in the world while staying true to our licensing business model.
