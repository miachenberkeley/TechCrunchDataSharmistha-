Microsoft may have sold off some of its mapping assets to Uber last week, but almost as if to show that its still taking Bing Maps seriously, the company today announced a new preview release of Bing Maps for the web.The redesigned Bing Maps puts more emphasis on travel planning than routing, which makes sense, given that looking for directions is now something most people probably do on their smartphone (though I hear some people still print out their MapQuest directions like its 2003).I always thought Bing Maps was one of the underappreciated highlights of Microsofts Bing portfolio and with this update, the company is launching a couple of new features that show theres still some room for (at least a bit of) innovation in this market.Because Bing Maps now organizes your searches in cards and remembers your last searches, its easy to switch back and forth between results. But Bing Maps also keeps those different searches plotted on the map, so its easy to see where placesare in relation to each other (maybe you are looking for asushirestaurant next to a movie theater, for example).Because chances are you will still look at your travel route on Bing Mapsbefore you leave on your trip, the service now also tries to predict the best time to leavebased on your travel time and the historical data it has about traffic (this is probably the same data that also powers a similar Cortana feature).In addition, Bing Maps can now also now highlights hotels, restaurants and gas stations near your route. Thats a nifty little feature and something thats sorely missing in Google Maps.Even though Microsoft sold off some of its image collection assets, the new Bing Maps still highlights the companys Streetside project (which is basically a copy of Googles Street View). Thetool now features a usefulsplit-screen mode that shows the map at the bottom of the screen with the street-side view on top.Microsoft also says that it has made the new layout more touchscreen-friendly and thatsharing your searches is now easier.While Bing Maps still features Microsofts usual high-resbirds-eye view and satellite imagery, one feature that seems to be missing in this preview is Microsofts 3D maps, which were one of the highlights of the Bing Maps desktop preview for Windows 8.
