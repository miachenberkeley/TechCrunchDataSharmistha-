Microsoft said earlier that its Cortana personal assistant  something of a rivalto Google Now and Apples Siri  would take on its competition by offering cross-platform support, including via iOS and Android.It then delivered on those promises in August when it rolled out a Cortana for Android beta. Now it seems the iOS release is nearing, too  as the company has begun recruiting beta testers for the iOS build, with invitations expected to be emailed within weeks.Thisnews was reported earlier by ZDNets Mary Jo Foley and The Verge, who both pointed toa link to a survey for testers posted recently by Microsoft officials in an online community forum.According to the survey, the Cortana for iOS beta is only available in the U.S. and China, though over time, it will become available to all the same regions where Cortana for Windows is supported, the company notes. Microsoft may also be looking for testers who use the app on a Windows 10 PC, it seems, as one of the survey questions was related to the frequency of their Windows 10 usage.The companion application is one of Windows 10s standout features, offering voice-powered searches; the ability to get answers about sports scores, movie show times, restaurants and other items; the ability to set reminders and alarms, track flights, place calls, dictate SMS messages, and more.The Android beta build has since grownto between 50,000 and 100,000 installations, according to data from Google Play  a decent enoughnumber given itsa private test, but also one that indicates many Android users are happy enough using the built-in Google Now assistantinstead.On mobile devices, the Cortana app isnt as functional as it is on Windows and Windows Phone. For example, Microsoft said earlier that its Hey Cortana hotword functionality to start the app wont initially be available. And if the iOS beta islike the Android release, youalso wont be able to open apps from Cortana, or toggle settings as you can on Windows PCs.Microsoft says it will begin sending out download links via email to on-board testers in the coming weeks.
