Microsoft showed off a version of Minecraft designed specifically for HoloLens today for the first time at its E3 2015 press show. The HoloLens augmented reality display lets you view Minecraft in 2D anywhere you want, on a wall for instance, but also lets you display a 3D version of the world youre interacting with on a surface like a table.You can play with others in the Minecraft world for a seamless multiplayer experience, and peek around and inside the block-based Minecraft world. The player with HoloLens can manipulate the environment and expose hidden elements, plus issue overworld commands that provide almost god-like powers.Developing
