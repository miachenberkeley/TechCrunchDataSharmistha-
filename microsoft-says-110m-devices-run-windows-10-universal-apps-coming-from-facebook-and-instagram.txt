(A big leap for a platform that was very late to the Instagram party, you may recall.)Other apps that will get the universal treatment include story-telling visual app Flipagram, Box, Candy Crush Soda Saga and Uber, he said.Myersonalso said that there have now been 1 billion visits to the Windows Store  without giving out any stats on downloads. He said that developer payouts have grown four-fold since the Windows 10 upgrade went out earlier this year  again, declining to give a hard number.The 110 million figure is a slight update on the 100 million devices noted at the end ofSeptember.At the end of September, Microsoft notedthere were about 670,000 apps on the Windows Store, which combines apps for phones along with Windows NT apps and universal apps, or those that work on multiple platforms. As a point of comparison, Apple has about 1.5 billion apps and Google has 1.6 billion on Google Play.Well update this post with more apps news as it comes out of the event.
