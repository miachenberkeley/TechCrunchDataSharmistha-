Microsoft has posted a bit of CG describing what it will feel like to use the HoloLens, their augmented reality helmet, in real life. The resulting video, shot at Case Western Reserve University, shows doctors examining bodies as they float in midair, creating a new way to teach anatomy.The resulting interaction  pinching to hide images, swiping through musculature  is certainly exciting but Id like to see this stuff happening in real time. Remember  the Microsoft Surface was originally supposed to revolutionize tabletop gaming.
