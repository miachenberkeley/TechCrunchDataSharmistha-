Microsoft has moved to dispel Europeanmistrust ofU.S.-operated cloud services by announcing a plan to offer cloud services, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online, from data centers in Germany thatare also operated by a third party company in a so called trustee model.Commenting on the launch in a statement, CEO Satya Nadella, saidthe trustee model willoffer customers in German and Europe choice and trust in how their data is handled and where it is stored.The forthcoming Microsoft Cloud in Germanywill be offered to customers of its cloud services as another option for local data storage, with Microsoft name-checking target sectorswith particular concerns for thesecurity of data, such as finance, health and the public sector. It also noted a 2015 BITKOM study which found a largemajority (83 per cent) of German enterprises expect acloud provider to operate local data centers in Germany.The underlying context here is ongoing European concern overU.S. government mass surveillance practices and the impact thoseintelligence dragnets are having on the perception ofdata security in the commercial cloud. Also relevant:ongoing legal uncertainty followingthe landmark decision by Europes top court to invalidate the fifteen-year-old Safe Harbor transatlantic data transferagreement between the U.S. and the EU last month  itself triggered in large part by the 2013 revelations of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.Microsoft said its cloud in Germany will launch in the second half of 2016, and will be operated under German law by T-Systems, a subsidiary of telco Deutsche Telekom. The two data centers will be based in Magdeburg and Frankfurt am Main, with Microsoft stressingthis data trustee model means it will not have any access to customer data without the consent of the trustee, and thatit cannot therefore be compelled  even by a third party  to hand over customer data.The movecomes in addition to recent regional European data center expansions by Microsoft, with the company this week announcing it will be opening local data centers in the U.K.in late 2016 (Amazon also announced its firstAWS U.K. data center earlier this month) andnotingthe completion ofrecent data centerexpansions in Irelandand theNetherlands.Microsoft saidtodayit now hasmore than 100 data centers in 24 regions serving more than140 countries, offering a mix of public, partner, private and hybridcloud computing services.Howeverlocal data centers that are still operated by Microsoft currently offer little protection against U.S. intelligence agencydemands for data  hence the additional option of a trustee model, relying on pro-privacy German law, in a bid toreassure European customers their data will not be sucked up by intelligence agency dragnets.Despite Microsofts claims that customer data in its German trustee ran data center will be subject to German, rather thanU.S., law, Forrester cloud computing analyst Paul Miller notesthis isstill an untested assumption,legally speaking.Microsofts lawyers and T-Systems lawyers argue that the German Data Trustee model, which is at the heart of this weeks deal and is governed by German law, will be effective in shielding data from U.S. demands. But, to be sure, we must wait for the first legal challenge. And the appeal. And the counter-appeal, he saidstatement.Miller added that a far more harmonized set of laws are neededat both theEuropean and global level to create certainty for businesses arounddata security  albeit he said the latter remains a long way off.Updated EU data protection legislation is still being negotiated, with European politicians hoping to have an agreement on a newGeneral Data Protection Regulation by the end of this year.
