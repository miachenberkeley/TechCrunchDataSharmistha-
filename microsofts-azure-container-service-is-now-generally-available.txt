Azure Container Service, Microsofts containerscheduling and orchestration service for its Azure cloud computing service, is now generally available.The service, which allows its users to choose either Mesospheres Data Center Operating System (DC/OS) or Dockers Swarm and Compose to deploy and orchestrate their containers, was first announced in September 2015 and hit public preview this February.As Microsofts CTO for Azure (and occasional novelist) Mark Russinovich told me, he believes this ability to use both Docker Swarm/Compose and the open-source components of DC/OS  both of which are based on open-source projects  makes the Azure Container Service stand out from some of its competitors.As Russinovich told me, the company doesnt want to tell its customers which of these two services to use. Its our job to make sure our customers can use either one or both on our cloud and have a great experience, he said.Microsofts history with Mesosphere goes back quite a bit, of course. At first, the company worked with Mesosphere to allow its users to run its DC/OS on Azure; the two companies are also partnering to bring DC/OS support to Windows and Hyper-V containers, as well. In addition, Microsoft made a strategic investment in the company (and Microsoft reportedly tried to buy Mesosphere at one point last year, something Russinovich didnt want to comment on, of course).Microsoft also believes that using these open-source solutions means its users can easily take their workloads and move them on-premise when they want (or move their existing on-premise solutions to Azure, too, of course).The one service missing from Microsofts line-up here, though, is Googles Kubernetes, which is also an open-source project. Russinovich argued that the company is focusing on the open-source technologies its customers arerequesting  and with that, he obviouslyimplied that its customers arent currently asking for Kubernetes (though he also left the possibility open that Azure Container Serviceswould one day support it).As Russinovich noted, the company is seeing lots of companies that are now moving their workload to containers. A few years ago, it was very much dev test, but now whole companies are adopting it in production, he said.Russinovich told me that Microsoft doesnt currentlyhave any plans to offersupport through a similar arrangement it currently has with Red Hat, for example, where Red Hat and Microsoft staff are co-located. Microsoft will offer basic Mesosphere support, though, and Mesosphere will handle tier 2/3 support for advanced topics.
