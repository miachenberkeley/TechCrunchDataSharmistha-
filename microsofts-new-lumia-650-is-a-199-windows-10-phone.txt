Microsoft unveiled its first Lumia phones running Windows 10 back in October, and today it offered up a third and much cheaper variant.If last years Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL looked impressive  impressive for phones running on a dead platform  then the Lumia 650, which was outed today, is the budget version, coming in as it does at $199  far cheaper than the $549 and $649 of the 950 and 950 XL.That $199gets youfive-inch OLED screen,eight- and five-megapixel cameras and the front and back, and aQualcomms Snapdragon 212 which doesnt support Microsofts Continuum  phone-to-PC feature.The Redmond-based company is billing the device as a business phone that represents an affordable way to get Windows 10 into your workforces pocket  the smart choice for your business.But, but, but, but you really have to ask ifthats the best use of corporate money, at this point.TechCrunchs Natasha Lomas explainedlast month that Windows Phone is officially an ex-platform. Microsofts phone-based revenue plummeted by 49 percent, with quarterly sales dropping from 10.5 million units to4.5 millionover one year. Even CEO Satya Nadella conceded that numbers have gone south since our strategy change announced in July 2015.Yet, here we are, weeks later, with what seems like a nice looking, capable and wallet-friendly release. Another Windows Phone that you wont and (since app developers care about whether the eyeballs  and companies have longshifted to bring-your-own-device) shouldnt buy.There have been rumors that Microsoft is preparing a service phone and that this is the last Lumia device well see. Thats based on the company relocating the once-independent Lumia team into the Surface team. As Thurrott.com, a Microsoft authority, explained though, at this point nobody knows what devices that new working relationship will produce soall the speculation is moot.Judging Microsoft on the here and now: the Lumia 650 looks fine, but the Windows Phone game is all but over.
