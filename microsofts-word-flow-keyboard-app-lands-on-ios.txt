Microsoft has released anext-word predicting keyboardas aniOS app as it seeks to tap into the popularityof Applesmobile ecosystemin the hopes ofexpanding its influence inthe mobile productivity space.The Word Flow app, which was developed byMicrosofts in-house experimental projects division, Garage,is nowlive in the U.S. App Store  although its not yet available inEurope.Earlier this month the companyhad offered beta sign-ups for iOS users but its now flicked the switch for users in the U.S.The appwas originally developed for itsown smartphoneplatform (ne Windows Phone), and has also been offered to users ofits desktop product, Windows 10.As well as next word predictions, the Word Flow app offers the promise of faster texting via aswipe to type input  a la other keyboard apps like Swype. A little more novel is a one-handed typing mode thatdisplaysthe keyboard asan arc in order to allow for easier typing via just a thumb. Users can also customize the look and feel of the Word Flow keyboard.Keyboard tech was one of the ways Microsoft soughtto advance the fortunes ofits Windows Phone platform in the early years, as it battled to poachmarket share from more dominant rivals. One reason to focus its efforts on the keyboardwas that Apple initiallyblockeddevelopers from offering system-wide keyboards on iOS, and was also arguably slow to add more advanced features to the native iPhone keyboard leaving a gap for othersto exploit.However, Cupertinochanged its stance on system wide keyboards with 2014s iOS 8, opening upto outside developers andalso loadingmore capabilitiesinto the native keyboard (such as its own next-word prediction tech). Meanwhile, Microsofts hopes of building mobile market share momentum,and makinga dent in the Android-iOS duopoly, failed to materializeforcingthe companyto double-down on building apps to try tomake a major mark inmobile.To further this strategy, back in February Microsoft shelled out $250 million to acquire London-based keyboard maker SwiftKey, an early mover in the next-word prediction keyboard tech space. Itsaid at the time thatit would be integrating SwiftKeys technology into its existing Word Flow tech  as well as exploringscenarios for the integration of the core technology across the breadth of our product and services portfolio.Microsoftalso said it would continue to offer SwiftKeys apps, whose functionality clearlyoverlap with its own Word Flow product  albeit the formercan boast rather greater usage.At the time of the acquisition by Redmond, SwiftKey hadamassed installs on some 300 million devices across Android, iOS and its SDK products (the vast majority on the Android platform).Word Flow is not Microsofts only keyboard offering. Its Garagedivisionhas produced another keyboard app, called Hub, which was on iOS already. But that keyboard app focuses on multitasking and productivity forOffice 365users by letting them search for and share documents from other Microsoft services such as OneDrive and SharePoint. Which israther less interesting than more open productivity keyboard plays, such as Barcelona-based keyboard startup ThingThing.While messaging apps have demonstratedthe ability to scale outa platform on (anothers mobile) platform, with WhatsApp, for example, passing the 1billion monthly active users mark earlier this year, its far less certain thatproductivity appslikekeyboardscan hope to achieve such scale.Indeed, SwiftKeys exit to Microsoft suggests there are far harder and more boundedmargins on potential growth in the productivity app space. (Which then rather does raisethe question why Microsoft has not focused more resources on driving the development and market share of thatwell-known messaging app Skype that it acquired way back in 2011 ah thoseRedmond dreams of what could have been!)
