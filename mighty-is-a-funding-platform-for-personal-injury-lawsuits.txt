As anyone who has ever been in court knows, lawsuits are often a long, tedious process. This is especially true with lengthy personal injury litigation,during which the injured party is often unable to produce income.Powerful defendants commonly take advantage of this, offeringlowball settlements in hopes that the plaintiff will settle out of necessity for a quick payout. The result is an imbalanced legal system where injured plaintiffs are shortchanged, just because they dont have the financial wherewithal to support themselves during a trial.EnterMighty, a startuphoping to level the playingfield by helping plaintiffsraise the funds needed bridge the gap between settling a lawsuit, and the costs of living through one.The New York-based plaintiff financing platformhas recently raised a $5.25M Series A, and has just announced that usershave investedover $1 million in plaintiffs since the company launched in September.The average amount of funding on Mighty is $5,000, and a plaintiff can only finance up to 10 percent of their settlements estimated value. While deals are vetted by the startup, the ultimate decision to invest lies in the hand of the platforms individual investors, which are often lawyers looking for an additional source of income.Funding on Mighty is structured as a non-recourse investment, meaning that if a plaintiff loses a case, they dont owe investors anything.The platform itself is designed to bea marketplace,meaning investors compete to attract plaintiffs by trying to offer thelowest rate of return. That being said,Mightys average rate ofreturn hovers between 20-30 percent annuallymuch higher than a traditional loan or credit card.However, its important to note that theserates are for non-recourse financing, meaning the higher rate is in return for a plaintiff not having to take on debt if a case is lost. Additionally, these investmentsare often the sole factor in allowing a plaintiff to hold out for a fair and larger settlement. This means that most plaintiffsend up making more money post-settlement by receivinga Mighty investment, even though it may beat a high rate of return.While investmentswith APRs of around 30 percentmay initially seem predatory, the fact is that thisfinancing results in higher, fairer payouts for plaintiffs, with practicallyno risk of going into debt or bankruptcy.Ultimately, a platformlike Mighty is good for the legal industry, and is another example of technology being used to level the playing field in a court of law.
