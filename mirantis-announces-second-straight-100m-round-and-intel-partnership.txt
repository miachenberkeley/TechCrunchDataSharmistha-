Last October, Mirantis, the pure-play OpenStack vendor announced a $100 million round. Just10 months later, its back with anidentical announcement. This time the investmentis led by Intel Capital and includes a partnership with Intel to help accelerate OpenStack in the enterprise.Goldman Sachs, August Capital, Insight Venture Partners, Ericsson, Sapphire Ventures and WestSummit Capital also participated. The fundsinclude a mix of equity and spending with $75 million coming on the equity side, according to anSEC document filed last week.OpenStack is the open source cloud operating system launched in July 2010 to provide an alternative to proprietary public cloud infrastructure vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It led to a flurry of startups, but in the last year many have been scooped upby larger companies with Cisco grabbing Metacloud in 2014, then going back for more with Piston in June. IBM bought BlueBox, EMC got Cloudscaling  and Nebula, a particularly promising one, simply closed its doors last spring.Against this backdrop, Mirantis remains standing and its hoping that working closely with Intel, along with the huge infusion of money, willhelp it advance OpenStack in the enterprise. While it has made progress, several key problems remain related to scaling in large settings.The Intel partnership will include resources such as access to hardware labs and a variety of gear at a scale, which Mirantis couldnt accesson its own, Alex Freedland, Mirantis president and co-foundertold TechCrunch.Mirantisoffers what it calls a pure version of OpenStack, and Freeland believes thats what separates his company from the big players in the market. Mirantis is an open platform where everyone can come in and not be guarded by proprietary walls. This is the only way to drive down cost and drive up features, he said.Mirantis is not onlycompeting against majortechnology companies like IBM, Cisco, HP and Oracle selling OpenStack, its also battlingagainst more mature and better funded enterprise technologies from VMware and Microsoft.Ithopeswith this combination of funds and resources to get to the point where a large enterprisecould deploy OpenStack across all of its infrastructure, Freeland explained. Today, OpenStacktends to be implemented in smaller projects.He pointed out that it took nearly a decade for VMware and Red Hat to get to that level of maturity. OpenStack is only five years old.As for Intel, its getting increasing requests from companies seeking help running theirown cloud infrastructure. It hopes the investment in Mirantis will help expediteOpenStack development for customers running itshardware, Jason Waxman, VP and GM for cloud platforms at Intel explained.Working together, the two companieshope to see significant improvement over the next 12 months, and expect to see some enhancementsrelated to this collaboration as soon as this year, Freeland said.If perhaps you were thinking that this is the first step towardIntel buying Mirantis, Waxman quickly put that idea to rest. If we were interested in an acquisition, we would have cut to chase, he said. Intel obviously thinks highly of Mirantis or it wouldnt be making this investment, but Waxman made clear it has no interest in being a distributor of OpenStack.Its been a good period for Mirantis with a pair of $100 million rounds in less than a year. In 2014, it generated the largestOpenStack sale ever, a $30 million dollar deal with Ericsson(which is also contributing funding to todays deal).Todays announcementbrings its total raised across all rounds to $220 million.
