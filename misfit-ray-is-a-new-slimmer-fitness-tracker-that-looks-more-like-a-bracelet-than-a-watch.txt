With its first major product release since its acquisition by watchmaker Fossil Group in November, Misfit today debuted its latest entry in its line of fashion-forward fitness trackers with the launch of the Misfit Ray. The fitness and sleep monitor features a cylindrical aluminum body, and works with the companys other Misfit-branded or custom accessories, and can be worn as either a bracelet or a necklace. In addition to its health-monitoring functions, the new Ray can also interoperate with Misfit Link, the software that lets you control things around you  like switching the lights on or off, changing your music, taking a selfie, and more.Style-wise, the Misfit Ray is a bit of a departure from the companys other fitness trackers, the Shine, Shine 2, Flash, and the smart button Link, which feature a more traditional, circular design that recalls a watchface rather than something thats more competitive with the slimmer Fitbit.Instead, the Ray is 12mm in diameter and 38mm long, which makes it easier to be worn amid a row of bracelets, perhaps. The tracker comes in both Rose Gold and Carbon Black, and includes a 3-axis accelerometer like the one found in the Misfit Shine 2. Also included is a vibration motor that is used to remind you to get moving  similar to how the Apple Watch will remind you to stand after a period of inactivity, for example.The Rayalsohas a single multicolor LED, and can alert you to incoming texts and calls as well asbuzz asilent alarm. Like other Misfit wearables, the deviceis water resistant up to 50 meters and it doesnt require charging. (The battery lasts for 6 months, and is user-replaceable, the company says.)Ray wearers can monitor their sleep duration and quality, track their steps, tag specific activities like cycling or yoga, see their calories burned and more using Misfits mobile app.The new device will begin at $99.99, which makes it the same price as the newer Misfit Shine 2.Basically, Misfit has repurposed its tech into a slimmer form factor to give consumers a choice thats more about aesthetics, rather than a new or expanded feature set. However, despite the new look, the Ray is not really competitive with the high-fashion Fitbit products, like Tory Burchs line, which turns the tracker into a more elegant accessory.Instead, the Misfit Ray still ships with a sporty, rubber band, making the device feel more casual. That said, the price makes it much more affordable than Burchs gold and silveraccessories, which start at $165 and go up to $195, and still require you to buy the Fitbit separately.
