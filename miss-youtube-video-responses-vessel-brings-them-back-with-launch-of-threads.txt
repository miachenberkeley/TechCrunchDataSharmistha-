Vessel, thevideo subscription service ledby former Hulu CEO Jason Kilar and former Hulu CTO Richard Tom, is expanding in a new direction with the launch of a feature called Threads, designed to encourage more social interaction between video creators and viewers. The idea, the company explains, is to allow creators to interact with fans by asking them questions, encourage discussions on a given topic, or pose challenges.By focusing on the development of an online community, Vessel is movingbeyond its originalmission, which was primarily about giving fans early access to videos from their favorite creators as a subscription service. Video publishers were askedto release their videos first on Vessel  usually 72 hours ahead of YouTube  and in return, they were promised the ability to make more money than on free, ad-supported sites.Launched nearly a year ago, Vessels content today includes videos across a variety of topics, includinggaming, music, sports, beauty, lifestyle, comedy, fashion, science, tech, design and more. But the larger idea  prompted by the founders experience with Hulu  has been about bringingthe same kind of windowing model that exists with traditional media to online video. While most content on Vessel is free, subscribers can pay $2.99 per month for early access to videos.However,YouTube recently presented a challenge to Vessels business model: it justlaunched a subscription service of its own, called YouTube Red. In addition to several premium features such asoffline access, YouTube Red also provides a way to watch videos ad-free. That makes a subscription to Vessel look less appealing, perhaps.Given that Vessel already includes adsin addition to its subscription pricing, the primary draw for Vessel,then, would have been only usersability to see videos first before they hit YouTube. Other things like the appscurated experience or itsmobile-first design were just extra niceties.In other words, with YouTube now offering a subscription service of its own, Vessel needed something that would make it more of a draw for fans.The idea for Threads makes sense as a natural build-out of a community which is all about serving creators most devoted fans. After all, YouTube had distanced itself from the concept of fans replyingto creators via videowhen it turned off video responses back in 2013.The company claimed the feature was unused in terms of clicks, but the backlash from fans indicated there was interest in creating these replies, even if they werent heavily viewed. (Fans still regularly respond to videos on YouTube today, we should note, but theres no longer a proper video reply structure built into the site or its API.)Vessels video repliescould potentially pull bothcreators and fans time and energy away from YouTube  or at least, thats the hope.To take advantage of the new feature, Vessel says that fans can use the Vessel app on either iOS or Android to respond with their own videos. The feature is currently enabled for a handful of creators videos, but more will be added as Threads rolls out. Its also available on the free tier, which could attract a larger audience to Vessel thatmay convert to subscribers in the future.
