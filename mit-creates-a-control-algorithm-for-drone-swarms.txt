Swarms of drones flying in terrifyingly perfect formation could be one step closer, thanks to a control algorithm being developed at MIT.The complexitiesinvolved in controlling teams of moving robots so they dont crash into each other, or indeed wipe outother objects/entities that cross their path, is a hard problem that continues to keep roboticists busy.But theteam of researchers at MIT reckonthey have made a breakthroughthat could make perfect complex drone formations easier to pull off.They say theirdecentralized planning algorithmcan handleboth stationary andmoving obstacles, and doso with reduced computational overheads.Why are decentralized control algorithms better than centralized control algorithms? The basic answer is they are more resilient, given a centralized algorithm has a single point of failure if its central controllergoes offline.The researchers also assertthat decentralized algorithms have the advantage of handling erratic communication better than centralized algorithms. And whats more potentially erratic than a swarm of flying robots? But, on the flip side, theyare also harder to design, given thatall the moving pieces have to be involved in doinga bit of the thinking.In a centralized algorithm a single entity has all the information and finds a solution.In a decentralized algorithm each entity (robot) has only partial information of the environment and the other robots (for example, it can only see a few neighbors). The robots need to communicate to pass information and coordinate, explains, Javier Alonso-Mora, one of theresearchers involved in developing the algorithm.Up til now,most research on decentralized control algorithms has focused on making collective decision-making more reliable, according to the group deferring the (hard) problem of avoiding obstacles which they haverather chosen to drive straightat.The closest applications [for the algorithm] would be drone swarms navigating in formation, for example for surveillance of an area, mapping of an environment, addsAlonso-Mora, discussing potential futureapplications for robot teams. And mobile manipulators collaboratively carrying objects on the factory floor.Last year the team demoed a centralized version of the algorithm using a pair of wheeled robots tasked with carrying an object together. You can see a video of that project on YouTube here.Their decentralized algorithm requires what they say is significantly lower communicationsbandwidth, as well as lowercomputation cost, thanks to the distributed wayit makesrobots share intel on obstacle-free regionsin their immediate vicinity.How does this work? Insteadof eachrobot broadcasting to every other robot acomplete map of safe space around it, the decentralized algorithm has robotsonly share maps with their immediate neighbors and also has each calculate where neighbors mapsintersect with their own  sharing only relevant intersected data on to the next neighbor.So the idea is that, collectively, the team of robots maintains a comprehensive map of safeterrainwhile reducing thecomms data neededto keep the swarm moving.The robots do not communicate the position of all the obstacles they see.Instead, they communicate the region (set of linear constraints/convex region). So, they all get an overview of the free space without a need to know where all the obstacles are.This scales well in scenarios with many obstacles, adds Alonso-Mora.As well as mapping 3D space, the algorithm also includes a fourth dimension  time  to allow swarming bots to predict the trajectory of moving obstacles and re-route their own formationaccordingly.This process does involve some guestimation, with the researchers noting that it works in a mathematically compact manner by assuming that moving obstacles have a constant velocity.Obviously that assumption is not always true, but given that each robot updates its map several times per second they reckon its a short enough time span/margin of error to handle most accelerating objects, given that most moving obstacles will not dramatically change velocity at very high speeds.So far the researchers have tested their algorithm withsimulated drones and say it came up withthe same flight planstheyd expect a centralized control algorithm to.This resulted insquadrons of virtualmini helicoptersgenerally maintainingan approximation of their preferred formation (a square at a fixed altitude),but with the square sometimes rotating toaccommodate obstacles and/or the distances between drones contracting.Occasionally the drones would also fly single file or assume a formation in which pairs flew at different altitudes, they add.They have also tested the decentralized algorithm on physical (wheeled) robots, and suggestsuch a scenario could be useful to further use-cases where teams of robots are expected towork in environments also containing humans.We are working on a demonstrator with real vehicles as well as similar applications, saysAlonso-Mora.He adds that they may also experimentwith actual drones at a later stage, too. (Presumably theres rather higher costs involved with testing the robustness of control algorithms ifyour control robots are flying around mid-air )The researchers will be presenting their paper at the International Conference on Robotics and Automationnext month. Expect to wait rather longer to see a perfect formation of drones buzzing over your city.At this stage it is research,stressesAlonso-Mora, going on to note that manybig challenges remain when it comes to creating robust algorithms forcontrolling robot teams.Accounting for the robot dynamics. Long term guarantees in dynamic environments with many moving obstacles. Communication/networking issues in real systems. Perception of the environment. Just to name a few.
