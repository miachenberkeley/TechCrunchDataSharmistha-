Hong Kong is to be the location for a startup accelerator-style center of innovation from famed tech-focused U.S.universityMIT.TheMassachusetts Institute of Technology (better know as MIT) announced today that it will open its first ever Innovation Node in the Asian city-state next summer. The center will be a startup incubator of sorts which MIT said will [combine]resources and talentto help students learn how to move ideas more rapidly from lab to market.Thats much like an incubator program but, beyond that,it will provide researchopportunities with Hong Kong universities, a platform for events and community activity, and internships. There are also plans to open a makerspace for prototyping and testing new hardware and technology,which would be closely aligneda similar facilitythat MIT is currently building inthe U.S..Its no coincidence that MIT has picked Hong Kong. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the organizations president  Rafael Reif  cited the citys status as afinancial hub and its proximity to centers of innovation as key reasons.Universities in Hong Kong are very strong and the city has significant business expertise, Reifsaid. In addition to that, you also have manufacturing infrastructure in Shenzhen that can handle small volume manufacturing.Shenzhen, the South China city increasingly known as the worlds manufacturing hub,is a key part of the focus.The idea is to facilitate a way for MIT and Hong Kong students to collaborate physically or virtually to drive ideas toward commercialization. For instance, medical devices, sensors, or robotics could be prototyped on the MIT campus or at the node, tested in the Boston or Hong Kong regions, and have small quantities manufactured in Shenzhen, MIT explainedin a blog post.Japan, Chile and Singapore are the locations for MITs international centers, but the upcoming base in Hong Kong is the first that is dedicated to innovation and based outside of the U.S..A collectionof MIT alumni based in Hong Kong will advise the center and help coordinate programs. Some alumni are also among a group thatprovided initial financing for the project.
