MixRadio, the radio music service that was transferred from Nokia to Microsoft and thenbought by messaging app company Line last year, is finally available for iOS and Android. The service, which began life in 1999 when British artist Peter Gabriel founded it as OD2, wasonlybeen available for Microsoft (ne Nokia) Lumia handsets until now.Since Microsofts Windows Phone is a distant third in the mobile platform war  Kantar estimates itaccounts for less than five percent of phones sold in the U.S.  many people will be unfamiliar with MixRadio, so lets take a step back for a second.The service is an internet radio, similar in style to Pandora. Its free to use, and itmonetizes with advertising, which appears in an ad unit at the bottom of the tab  thats a lot more subtle than Pandora, but it is early days for MixRadio.The UK-baed serviceboasts a 35 million track catalog and comes with over 10,00 pre-made playlists,that includes your regular genre-based compilations and hand-crafted track lists from a range of artists, including Lana Del Rey, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. Pandora is limited to the U.S., Australia and New Zealand I have to summon my VPN to use it in Thailand, which is tricky on mobile butMixRadio is far more global with users in 31 countries.Like its illustrious competitor, MixRadio doesnt you to rewindsongs/playlists, while it alsolimits the number of skips you can make per playlist per hour. Interestingly though, MixRadio allows users to store parts of their playlist offline for playback without an internet connection. There is also an option to get more details on each artist, and you can buy tracks outright from third-parties stores (iTunes on iOS) too.MixRadioclaims to have millions of monthly active users through its distribution via Lumia devices  it didnt provide a figure for its total registered userbase  but launching on iOS and Android brings the potential to vastly increase that figure, even if it is fairly late to the scene and only a radio service.Ivesaid consistently that for a music service to be relevant, it must be on all major platforms, MixRadio CEO Jyrki Rosenberg told TechCrunch in an interview. We still consider Windows Phoneto be an important platform  particularly given our deal to pre-load the app on Lumia devices.Theres already Pandora and Apples iTunes Radio,competitors like Spotify, Deezer offer limited versions of their services for free, and Tidal, Rdio and others offering users a monthly subscription service  is there really a need for Yet Another Music Service?While it may mirror in some ways Pandora,Rosenberg said he believes that MixRadiodiffers from the competition with itsfocus on personalization and mobile. (For now, there is no desktop or web app.)The music industry is transitioning from physical to digital sales, and from downloading to streaming, he said. But we are focused on people, they want simplicity of use and a high level of personalization.[When] webegan to develop [it was] for mobile, whereas other competitors started from the computer screen, Rosenberg added.Rosenberg argued that internet radio remains a massive opportunity for the sheer simplicity that it offers.Many services are very focused on enthusiast users, he explained. Everyone loves music but everyone has a different taste  we believemost users would love a service that plays music that they like, but how many people have time [to create and develop their own playlists].The MixRadio CEO is bullish on the possibilities that analysing data and algorithms can service users up music that theyll appreciate based on their music history, and a few selections that the app prompts you to make when you open it for the first.I have a pretty weird eclectictaste, live in one of the many countries not supported by Pandora, and find that Spotify, Deezer and Rdio work well when I know what I want to listen to, but struggle to surface new music. For those reasons,the past few days of testing MixRadio for iOS has given me something different, but at times mixing together a bunch of different tunes hasnt been ideal.The fact thatmany of its rival serviceare not available across all countries gives MixRadiosome advantage. Though it remains to be seenwhat proportion of people in markets like India will pay for legitimate services, as I pointed out last week.Asia is an area where MixRadios alliance with Line could be interesting, although for now there is no integration between the music app and chat service with 205million monthly active users.Weve been part of a global company, Rosenberg said, And now we have a parent with a strong footprint in Asia. Weexpect [this launch will give us] growth in Asia in addition to Western markets.Rosenberg was light on specific details of how Line will useMixRadio, but with the Japanese company testing its own TV service in Southeast Asiaand a paid-for streaming service for kids in Japan, it is clear that it is looking to introduce entertainment services as part of itspush to turn itsmessaging app into a platform.Were not announcing integrations [with Line], but we are talking a lot with them on future innovative, he said.Moreimmediately though, MixRadio appears to have evolution plans of its own. Though he wouldnt be drawn into revealing specific details, Rosenberg coyly said that iOS and Android apps arevery interesting starting point for us.Were not announcing any other tiers, he said, when asked on plans to introduce free play options toMixRadio. But everything is possible.One partnership that MixRadio can talk about is with HTC. It is working with the smartphone maker to power the music component of itsBlinkFeedservice.You can find MixRadio for iOS here, and MixRadio for Android here.
