Baseball legend Ivan Pudge Rodriguez, who is now up for nomination for the 2017 Baseball Hall of Fame, is joining a venture capital fund.Pudge is joiningz9 Capital, a $25M fund based out of South Florida that focuses on making seed investments between $250k  $4M. He will be taking a VP spot, and focus on both looking for new investments, as well as using things he learned during hispost-baseball business career to actively advice and help grow current portfolio companies.While z9 considers itself a traditional VC fund, the group only invests in companies that will benefit from its active investingphilosophy. In fact, the group even provides its portfolio companies with in-house financial guidance, marketing advice and customer service.The fund alsorequires companies to begenerating about$500,000 in annual revenue before they invest. Essentially, z9 wants to find serial founders who have been successful enough to establish their business,but now need help taking it to the next level.Arequirement like this iscommon in cities like Miami, where the venture capitalscene is not yet large enough to support companies that arent focused on generating revenue. Chris Uhrig, VP of z9, explained that thisforces companies in the area to do whatever it takes to generate revenue and survive, which benefits them in the long run.These restrictions mean that the fund generally focuses on B2B and SAAS companies.That being said, they are still open to investing in companies that could benefit from Pudgeand the connections he could provide on the world of professional athletes.Uhrig explained that if it was a fit, z9 could help portfolio companies leverage Pudges likeness and access to accelerate their brand.That being said, Pudge was adamant that this isnt just a case of fund using his name. Since leaving baseball he has been active in the business world, investing and guiding companies in various industries.But is Pudge even interested in tech and startups? While he cautioned that his business experience isnt necessarily technology focused, you have to focus on technology now to be successful in business. Its the future.
