The days of Square clones popping up,everywhere you lookedandcapitalizing on Squares conservative approach to global expansion, are long gone. But those startups are not. And today, one of them is announcing a Series D round.Payleven, a mobile payments startup originally incubated in 2012 at Berlins Rocket Internet, says it has raised a $10 million growth round from a selection of existing investors  Holtzbrinck Ventures, ru-Net, B Cinque, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and MePay  as well as new backer Seventure Partners.Todays round brings the total raised to date by Payleven to $51 million, with no valuation being disclosed.This total and the growth round itself may sound like small amounts of money  not least foran e-commerce startup whose margins are thin and based on economies of scale. As a point of comparison, another European rival, iZettle, has raised nearly $245 million; Square before it went public disclosed nearly $600 million in funding.There is definitely an argument  especially these days when you consider Squares financial situationfor a startup holding down spend, fundraising and valuations, and instead trying to grow slowly and maybe moresensibly. But in any case, a Payleven spokespersonhints there may beanother round getting announced soon.Payleven is not getting very specific about how it plans to use the funds, except to note that it will go towards expansion into new products and the acceleration of customer acquisition. A spokespersonclaims that Payleven isalready profitable in certainmarkets and will be tipping into the black globally soon.To date, the company has built its business around point-of-sale hardware that works with iOS or Android smartphones and tablets (with two hardware options coveringcontactless andchip-and-pin at 59 and 79 in the UK and equivalent currencies elsewhere), with some accounting software around the transaction data  all of which it targets primarily at small retailers that may have previously found card-charging options too expensive to adopt.As with other providers of POS solutions, Payleven charges a flat 2.75% transaction fee that reduces down to 1.5% depending on volumes. (Amex transactions are always at 2.75%.) Payleven claims that the cost of setting up is returned back to retailers within six months of using the devices.Unlike Square, Payleven has from the start tried to build itself out as an international business, and currently, its live in 11 markets in Europe as well as Brazil. Part of Paylevensearly expansion was by way of Rockets own footprint, where Payleven usedsome of the infrastructure of Rockets other operations to grow its business.But down the line that strategy may take a different turn: in 2015, Payleven was rolled into a joint venture with the Philippines Long Distance Telephone company to create mobile payments services for emerging markets  although no new operations have been announced since then.There is another interesting piece of business development that could push Paylevens growth. It seems that the company quietly became the point-of-sale provider for customers of Adyen just this month, with Adyen  itself a payment processing powerhouse valued at $2.3 billion  apparently shuttering its own Shuttle mobilepoint of salesystemfor small businessesand referringcustomers over to Payleven.Adyen has decided to no-longer support their mPOS SME product, and hence have offered their existing and potential new customers the opportunity to work with us, a spokesperson from Payleven said.Its for these reasons, it seems, that Payleven has raised more money and may be attracting more.We are very excited about Paylevens growth. They have demonstrated to be on a clear path to profitability having a positive bottom line in some markets already today, said Wolfgang Krause, Seventure Partners, in a statement. Payleven shows that fintech companies can reach scale, highly attractive unit economics and ultimately profitability.Seventures portfolio also includes Parrot, Vistaprint (now called Cimpress) and Calendra (acquired by BMC).We are delighted to have won Seventure Partners support and look forward to further grow the business together with them, saidKonstantin Wolff, MDof Payleven, in a statement. Wolff, along with CTO Rafael Otero, is also a co-founder of the company.Payleven has an outstanding track record of differentiating in payments through changing the customer experience, offering great technology and tackling an underserved segment. This has enabled them to achieve customer payback periods of less than six months, something unheard of in financial services, saidSven Achter, general partnerat Holtzbrinck Ventures and chairman of the Payleven board.
