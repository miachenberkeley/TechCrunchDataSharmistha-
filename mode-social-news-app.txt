The digital media company formerly known as Glam is launching a new product today for finding curated stories in topics like entertainment, food and fashion.The website (namely, Mode.com) and the mobile app (called Mode Stories) will allow users to follow more than 10,000 editors, critics journalists, video producers and experts. Based on the topics and users you follow, as well as other activity in the app, Mode will give you a personalized feed of content.If that sounds like, well, a lot of other news apps, CEO Samir Arora noted that Mode isnt starting from zero  there are already 100,000 pieces of content in the system. He also said the existing Mode websites including Glam will now become channels under the Mode.com site  Mode Glam, Mode Brash, Mode Bliss and Mode Trend.The North Pole for us is, as a consumer, content is not getting easier, Arora said. We all have this problem  its harder and harder to differentiate good recommendations from someones first time at a sushi restaurant.  The people who know the most about these things are either the journalists, authors or editors.The company is also announcing a revamped streaming video service with original programming called Mode Video. (Mode announced its moves into video and content curation last year.)
