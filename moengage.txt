Along with earlier seed funding, MoEngages new round brings its total raised so far to over $5 million.MoEngages platform focuses on helping mobile apps figure out how to personalize push notifications, in-app notifications, and email campaigns, and deliver them at the right time to boost user engagement. The company plans to use its new capital to continue work on the next iteration of its mobile marketing automation platform for B2C companies and recently launched three new features.The first tracks which users have uninstalled apps, analyzes why with its prediction engine, and lets developers know if they should try to lure them back with email campaigns or network ads. The second adds geo-fencing so marketers can tailor push notifications to location, while the third helps companies create more refined email campaigns.Founded in July 2014, MoEngage claims that its mobile marketing automation platform is already the largest in India, profiling 20 percent of smartphone users in India. The company, which was created by Ravitja Dodda and Yashwanth Kumar to solve some of the problems they encountered at their last company, mobile developer Pipal Tech Ventures, now counts Snapdeal, TaxiForSure, Gaana, and Redbus among its clients.MoEngage competes against a roster of other automated mobile marketing and analytics companies, including Localytics, Appboy, Kahuna, and Urban Airship, but Dodda, its chief executive officer, claims it differentiates with the most advanced user-level personalization and real-time segmentation capabilities when compared to all other players in our space. Some of MoEngages unique features include smart behavioral triggers, highly customizable native in-apps, and uninstall tracking, he adds.In addition to the U.S. and India, Dodda says Southeast Asia is another important growth market for MoEngage.
