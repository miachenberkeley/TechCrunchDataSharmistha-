There are hundreds upon hundreds of Twitter-related plug-ins for WordPress. Seriously, go look.And yet, in its nine years since launch, Twitter has never released an official plug-in to make WordPress and Twitter play friendly. Until today.I figure anyone reading TechCrunch knows what the words WordPress and Twitter mean, so I wont be awful and explain what those two things are.Heres what the new Twitter WordPress plug-in does out of the box:If youre already happy with your third-party Twitter plug-in or custom-built Twitter solutions, this new plug-in  might not do very much in terms of new stuff for you. Hell, your current plug-in may even do more.One thing its lacking, at least at first glance: the ability to embed your Twitter feed, or at least your last few tweets, in your WordPress layout. Itll do individual tweets, but theres no mention of feed embedding  and thats a pretty popular use case for third-party Twitter plug-ins.But this plug-in wraps up a lot of the basics in an easy-to-deploy package and makes it a bit less necessary to hunt through the forest of unofficial plug-ins just to find one that both currently works and is probably going to keep working in the future.You can find the official plug-in right here.[Note: This post originally mentioned that WordPress was reporting crazy high download numbers for the plug-in. WordPress now says this was a bug that has been fixed.]
