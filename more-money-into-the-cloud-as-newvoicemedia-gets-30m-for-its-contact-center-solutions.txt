While NewVoiceMedia may not have a flashbrand and profile, its growing at a very steady and successful pace. At BGF Ventures we look to back UK companies that have the ambition and potential to be global technology leaders; we believe NewVoiceMedia will be one of the most successful software companies to emerge from Europe this decade, said new investor Rory Stirling fromBGF Ventures in a statement.For a whilenow, there has been a lot of talk right about the impending funding bubble about to burst: while its relatively easy currentlyfor a startup with a smart idea to pick up some funding to see if it can grow, the beliefis that this may not hold out forever. NewVoiceMedias CEO Jonathan Gale describes this latest investment as strategic capital, to continue doing what it has been for the last couple of years  expanding internationally and adding more talent to the organization to build the business.The climate has certainly cooled down, although there is still capital available, he said. The money isgravitating back to businesses with strong growth and capitalefficiency with a clear path toprofitability.The focus has moved away from growth at any cost and back tostrong financialmanagement,core businessfundamentals and well structured and executed business plans.Everyone knows the market is coolingand that it is likely to cool off more over the coming months. The days of vanity valuations based on irrational multiples are over, although we never played that game anyway.Gale says that since replicating its cloud platform in North America and Asia after earlier launching in London and Europe, the business has grown massively in those markets in particular. The company now works with some 500 enterprises, with an annual revenue run rate of $50 million. While today the balance between Europe and these markets is more in favor of NewVoiceMedias legacy business, Gale said heexpects that going forward the U.S. is likely to become its center of gravity in terms of future customers. International business in the last year grew 528%, he said.However, that is not the full story. Oneof the reasons why Salesforce has been interested in the startup is because it has helped Salesforce gain a better foothold in Europe specifically.Salesforce Ventures is committed to investing in technology that extends our offerings and makes our customers even more successful, said John Somorjai, EVP of Corporate Development and Salesforce Ventures, Salesforce, in a statement. NewVoiceMedia is a great example of the amazing innovation and commitment to customer success that were seeing across Europe.Gale says that thiswas fundamentally a strategic round to facilitate Salesforcemakinga larger investment in NewVoiceMedia, the largest investment that Salesforce has made in any non-U.S. headquartered company to date. Timing was not the motivator for us in this round, he said.The opportunity for NVM is pretty huge: businesses spend about $20 billion annually on telephony bills for customer care and sales calls  with a large part of that today still sitting in legacy systems. But as businesses look to cut costs, update software and leverage the power of new networked services to integrate more functionality, this gives an opening to the likes of NewVoiceMedia to win new business.NewVoiceMedia estimates that todays contact center market numbers about20 million seats and thatby 2020, it will see30% cloud penetration.Its not alone in trying to nab that opportunity, of course: in the area of cloud-based customer contact solutions, for example, NewVoiceMediacompetes against the likes of InsideSales and Five9but also  as you would expect in a disruptive industry  a fair amount of what Gale refers to as fledgling call center applications.
