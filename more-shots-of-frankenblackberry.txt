We got a glimpse of BlackBerrys rumoredAndroid-poweredsmartphone last month, in the form a render sharedon Twitterby notorious leaker Evan Blass. Nowphotos of the Android BlackBerryhave apparentlyleaked too  published byTaiwanese website Tinhte(spotted earlier byTechTimes).The latestphotosappear to confirm the rendered form factor we saw in last months leak, with atrademark BlackBerry physical Qwerty tucked under a sliding full size touchscreen  for a cake and eat it approach to mobile computing. The keys are not flat either, but rather look to havethe classic slopedshaping so beloved offormer CrackBerry addicts.As youd expect for a smartphone that has to pack in both full size touchscreen and (bumpy) physical keys, the most obvious trade-off is a fairly chunky form factor, albeit with curved sides  making it a little reminiscent of first wave Nokia Lumia Windows Phones.It also doesnt look like the battery will be removable, but hey you cant have everything  even if you want touchscreen-plus-Qwerty-plus-BlackBerry-hardware-plus-Android softwareOn the rear, theres a textured pattern which looks similar to the carbon-fiber scratch-proof backingMotorola used to clad certain of its more ruggedized devices with.Other features of note: a speaker grill that extends right across the bottom of the handset, a Micro SD card slot on the top of the device, and what is apparently an 18MP rear camera.Amusingly the phone has the WhatsApp messenger app at the top corner of the stock Android homescreen. Theres no sign ofBlackBerrys own BBM messenger.BlackBerry still hasnt confirmed its plans vis-a-vis Android, so the FrankenBlackBerry could be something its still toying with at this stage, rather than definitely releasing  although the noises coming out of the company have been increasingly skewing in Googlesdirection of late.Earlier this summer Reuters cited sources slating a fall launch for an Android slider BlackBerry. While CEO John Chen has also said he is not against the idea of building an Android phone if it can be done in a secure way. If I can find a way to secure the Android phone, I will also build that, he said back in June.Other mobile makers are alreadydoing just that of course  such as Silent Circles Blackphone, which runs a hardened version of Android and targets the enterprise segment where BlackBerry also plays  so reallyBlackBerrys hand is being pushed towards this slider launch.As it stands BlackBerrys marketshare in smartphones has collapsed to almosttotal irrelevance  with analyst IDC recently recording a share of 0.8 per cent for all other smartphone OSes, outside the dominant platforms: Android (81.1 per cent) and iOS (15.6 per cent), and third placed Windows Phone (2.6 per cent).
