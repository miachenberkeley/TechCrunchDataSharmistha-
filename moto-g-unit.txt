So much for pomp and circumstance. A day ahead of Google I/Os official kick off, Morotola/Lenovo has spilled the beans about three new versions of the companys warmly received Moto G line of budget handsets. With a naming scheme that will surely bring a wave of nostalgia to early-00s gaming fans and Power Mac owners alike, all three phones carry some iteration of the G4 naming scheme.The plain old G4 brings an upgraded 1080p 5.5-inch inch display to the table, along with a 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon processor, a quick-charging 3000 mAh battery, 2GB of RAM and either 16- or 32GB of storage, expandable via microSD. Theres also a 13-megapixel camera on the rear, coupled with a suite of different photography features.The Plus is, as the name implies, a souped up version of the basic G4. The specs are largely similar, but the rear-facing camera gets a bump up to 16-megapixels, which, along with the addition of extra focusing technologies, promises photo quality among the top smartphone cameras, ahead of iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, according to the company. The Plus also gets an fingerprint reader for waking it out of sleep and buying stuff from Google Play.The Play, meanwhile, has the lowest specs of the bunch and, likely, a price to match. Motorolas clearly not banking on blowing anyone away with the hardware, but you can probably expect the company to make a big push in developing markets. The handset offers a quad-core Snapdragon, 720p 5-inch display, 16GB of storage and a 2800 mAh battery.The Moto G and G Plus are both available today in Brazil (with the latter also available now in India) and will be coming soon to other global markets including North America. The G Play, meanwhile is arriving at some point this summer.
