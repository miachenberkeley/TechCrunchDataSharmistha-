Lenovo re-introduced Motorola smartphones to China in January, and now it has launched the Moto Maker customization service there too.For those not aware, Moto Maker allows customers to personalize their phone in a range of ways. They can select the colors, back cover, build materials and memory capacity of the device. Motorola claims there are thousands of possible combinations, and it believes that the uniqueness of the offering helps its smartphone stand above other devices, which are far more standardizedin design and require external cases or other accessories for the same level of personalization.China has more smartphones than any other country on Earth. We think it would be great if people there could choose phones that stand out from the crowd, Lenovo said in a statement.The Moto Maker launch isnt the only smartphone news from Motorola today.

The company saidChina accounted for 59 percent ofits smartphone shipments in 2014, and it will be interesting to see how Motorola performs in the country, particularly since thesmartphone industry is contracting for the first time in six years.Its been a busy day for Lenovo, which made a slew of announcements  including the reveal ofits own media streaming puck at its first company summit in China.
