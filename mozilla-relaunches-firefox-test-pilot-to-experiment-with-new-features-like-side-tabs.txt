Mozilla is bringing back its Test Pilot program for Firefox. The idea behind Test Pilot is to allow users  and Mozillas engineers  to test experimental browser features long before they arrive in the browser.A first version of Test Pilot first launched all the way back in 2009, but its focus was on studying how users interacted with their browser and not on testing new features.Mozilla, which is now working in a very different competitive landscape compared to a few years ago, is relaunching it to test what the organization calls rough concepts.With Test Pilot, Mozilla is combining prototyping and user research to quickly evaluate these concepts  something that the organization surely hopes will allow it to better compete with Google Chrome and Microsofts Edge browser.The relaunch currently features three experiments: a new take onputting tabs on the left side of the browser instead of the top of the window; an activity stream with a timeline of your browsing historyand recently bookmarked sites; and animproved Awesome Bar (Firefoxs universal search/URL bar).Some of these, like putting tabs on the side, already exist as third-party plug-ins, but none of these give Mozilla any telemetrics for how they are being used.The team is already working on bringing more experiments to Test Pilot, too.Mozilla believes that its Test Pilot guinea pigs will be the kind of users who consciously choose to use Firefox, arent afraid to try something new and want to be part of a unique community.Given that its hard for a browser developer with millions of users  even on its early release channels  to try experimental features, this projectallows Mozilla to try new things without upsetting its users, and it gives its hardcore fans an opportunity to have a voice in building these new features, too.
