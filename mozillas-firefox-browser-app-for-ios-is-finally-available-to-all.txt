Mozilla has been testing an iOS version of its popular web browser since September, and now Firefox for iOS is available publicly to anyone in possession ofan iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.Mozilla software is always released iteratively using test phases, so its no surprise that the availability of the companys inauguraliOS browser has slowly been enlarged overa long period with emphasis placed on getting user feedback and making changes.Last December, we reported that the nonprofit browser maker, which is focused on keeping the Internet open,would reverse its long-held stance against developing software for the App Store. Not long after, an early versionof Firefox for iOS rolled out to a limited number of testersin May. A first public beta then landed in September and, fast forward to today, thefinal version is live.Theres plenty of competition in this space already.Apples own Safari comes pre-installed on iOS devices  and isthe default for most apps  while Google Chrome, the webs most popular browser, is a top choice.Then there are other strong contenders like Opera  popular in emerging markets for its data compression technology  and a range of ad-block specialists, like Adblock Plus, that burst on the scene wheniOS 9 launched with an ad-block feature.So what does Mozilla have to shout about with its app?Well, itis primarily aimed at Mozilla users with support for Firefox accounts, which enables existing Mozilla loyalists to bring their saved bookmarks, browsing history, tabs and passwords to mobile. However, Mozilla is hoping that features like search prediction, its visual tab management system, and incognito browsing will lureothers, too.I played around with Firefox for iOS and found it to bepretty speed and nifty, but ultimately theres very little difference in terms of features acrossmost browsers. The choice often comes down to design, small tweaks orconvenience.On that note, as someone who is already heavily invested inChrome, with personalized bookmarks, extensions and more, it would be tough for me to switch over to Firefox when theres little difference in terms ofperformance.Making the appa success iscertainly a tall order, especially since itis entering the App Store at such a late time, but Mozilla has at least finally filled a gapingvoid on mobile with this release.If your Apple device is runningiOS 8.2 or newer,you can download Firefox for iOS here.
