At first glance, mParticle might seem to be focused on a pretty specific niche  helping mobile app-makersconsolidate their data. But the New York City startup counts companies like Airbnb, SeatGeek, Soulcycle and Spotifyamong its customers, and it recently raised a $15 million Series A.The fundingwas first revealed in a regulatory filing last month and officially announced yesterdayon the company blog. Social Capital (formerly known as The Social+Capital Partnership) led the round, with the firms partner Ted Maidenberg joining mParticles board of directors.I wrote about mParticle back in 2014, but co-founder and CEO Michael Katz said the real turning point was early last year, thanks to broader growth in mobile marketing.There were a couple of high profile exits, which kind of spawned more and more investment into the space, more innovation, he said. And people think about things differently  theres no notion ofset it and forget it when itcomes to applying your data to running your business.In other words, its becoming more and more important to experiment with mobile marketing and analytics services, and mParticleallows publishersto collect the necessary datawithout integrating a bunch of different SDKs  which is not just a pain, but can also cause issues with app performance. As Katz put it, mParticlehelps publishersembrace this data opportunity, separate from the tools that consume that data.The startup is opening a San Francisco office and will continue to invest in product development. Katz said healso sees a big opportunity in bringing similar tools to apps on other Internet-connected devices, whether its wearables or Internet-connected cars.Everybody in this day and age understands that their data is probably the single most valuable asset they have in their organization, that and their employees, headded.Existing investors Bowery Capital, Eniac Ventures and Golden Ventures also participated in the new funding.
