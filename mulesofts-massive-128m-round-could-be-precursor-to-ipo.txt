Todays investment brings the total to a whopping $258.5M raised. A raise this big could also be a signal that an IPO isnt far off.We did decide and take investment from some public company institutions because we wanted to develop those relationships and get the motion of working with public market investors, MuleSoft CEO Greg Schott told TechCrunch.He also indicated, while they are at the scale to go public, and this could be construed as a step in that direction, he obviously couldnt say when that would happen. In Q1, we hit $100M annual run rate in new bookings. We are growing fast and we are at the scale to be a public company. We intendfor that to happen and its just a question of timing. For now, he said the companyfelt it was a good time to raise the private round to continue growing the business.MuleSoftoffersa platform that connects applications, data and devices. Thats a pretty good place to be right now, and it could explain why this wide variety of investors were interested in seeing the company continue to develop.Schott said that 20or 30 years ago, companies built monolithic applications, and their jobs were to manage all of that complexity. All of that has changed now, and everything is broken into pieces. Now the job is to glue all the pieces together from SaaSproviders, applicationsor connected devices, hesaid.He says the reason his company is growing so quickly is there is this enormous need to connect things in rapid fashion and MuleSofts platform enables customers to do that quickly. Instead of manually writing code to make these connections, MuleSoft is doing the heavy lifting and making it much easier.Thats one of the reasons that ServiceNow and Salesforce.com were so interested in investing in MuleSoft because as SaaS companies, they see how important it is for customers to stitch together various services. Its not enough to have an openAPI, there needs to be something in the middle like MuleSoft to help pull it all together when multiple services are involved.We expose those APIs and connect to them instead of hand-writing code, which reduces cost and expense and speeds up the [development] process, he said.
