Munchery, the on-demand meal delivery startup with over $117 million in funding, has lost Pascal Rigo, who came on board to Munchery as chief customer experience officer just five months ago. Rigo had formerly spent three years at Starbucks as SVP of food, after the coffee giant bought La Boulange, the bakery chain Rigo founded in 1996. Rigo resigned because he didnt share Muncherys strategy for growth and vision for the future anymore, Rigo told Eater SF.When Rigo joined Munchery in October, he told me his goal was to make Muncherys delivery bags as iconic as the Starbucks cup. Ultimately, as Muncherys first-ever chief customer experience officer, hewas in charge of every aspect of Munchery that had a touch point with the customer  from working with chefs to make sure the food was good to developing new programs.Under Rigos leadership, Munchery launchedready-to-cook meals, which are designed to serve two people and takes just 15 minutes to cook.Whats next for Rigo? Well, he plans to focus on his family and La Boulangerie, the group of sixbakeries in the San Francisco Bay Area he opened last year, according to Eater SF. Rigos departure happened at an interesting time, given that Muncherys competitor SpoonRocket shut down yesterday, and its other competitor, UberEATS, just launched a standalone delivery app in the U.S.The entire Munchery team thanks Pascal for his many contributions to the company, a Munchery spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. Under his leadership and direction, we have elevated our menu offerings  most notably through the launch of our Ready-to-Cook line of meal kits  brought on new chef partners and laid the foundation for exciting projects, soon to be announced. La Boulangerie will continue as a key supplier of Muncherys breakfast and dessert options, with Pascal remaining an important business partner to the Munchery team.
