The value proposition of apps which allow you to share music though messaging, like PingTune or MusicMessenger is, largely, to chat about music. Meanwhile, apps like TunePics, Mindie and Flipagram are more about sharing music in a public, Twitter-like, feed. While Music Messenger, PingTune, Mindie and Flipagram have raised VC funding, TunePics has not, being rather the product of an agency.However, what I like about the app Musicyou, is that its a fast way to share music privately way, as it does not have a public feed. This is going to appeal to people who, most of the time, cant be bothered to share the music they listen to in public, such as on Spotify, but would share it with people who share their tastes in a private way with friends. You can add music easily to your content such as texts and pictures.The startup has now secured a seed round of 300,000 euros from two strategic investors: lead investor Smart Equity, a privately owned business angel investment vehicle, and Brains2Market, the business partner and Angel organisation.Its also landed an exclusive deal with PT Portugal, Portugals largest telecommunications service provider, to be an exclusive promotional partner for the music festival MEO SW, taking place 5-9 August.You can share any moment  text, photos or videos  with music across any messenger app, social network or social media. You choose a song from iTunes and add it to your content.As founder Rui Lopes says, Musicyou does not have the intention to be better than other music players. We are just bringing a new music experience focused on the private sharing of music.Lopes worked at mobicomp, acquired by Microsoft, and Cloud9 is his second company. And co-founder Goncalo Fernandes was responsible at T.I.M.we  a mobile content company.
