Muere la revolucin. Spanish smartphone makerGeeksphone has confirmed its stepping out of the mobile making game almostsix years after founding a startup business tobuild handsets for anenthusiast community of geekslooking for something a little different to mainstream smartphones.In a notepostedto its user forum, spotted earlier by Tech.eu, Geeksphonewrites that the mobile ecosystem has moved on and its foundingconceptof serving a niche geek communityis no longer a viable way to differentiate a mobile handset business.The reality of the company today is very different from what it was in the beginning, since the concept of innovation based on a passionate geek community, talented and creative, has now much less sense and it is a differentiation, which currently generates little interest in the mobile environment in relation to the 2009 date of our creation, it writes.Its unclear how many handsets Geeksphone has sold over its five+ years of operation. It released six handsets in all, and refers only to sellingseveral thousand terminals. Itstarted out building Android based smartphonesbut also branched into Firefox OS, and a multi-OS handset where users could choose to between Android or FFOS post-purchase.Its fair to say thatFFOS has failed to gain traction in the market, despite significant carrier backing at launch. Whilecompeting as an Android OEMhas only got tougher and more competitive since 2009, even ashandsetchoice has proliferated for buyers, quality has gone up and price-tags have been squeezed, shrinking the appeal of Geeksphones proposition.By far the startupsmost high profilesuccess was forming an alliance, at the start of 2014, with secure communications provider Silent Circle to build a security hardened Android handset, called Blackphone ridinga wave of pro-privacy feelingin the wake of the Snowden revelations.Silent Circle has since bought out its erstwhile hardware partner, and acquiredall itsengineeringstaff, along with co-founder Javier Aguera. So Geeksphones legacy lives on there. The Blackphone makers aretargeting the gap in the market left by the collapse of Blackberrys business, shifting from theoriginal prosumer propositiontowards a BYOD enterprise mobile security sales pitch.MeanwhileGeeksphones other co-founder, Rodrigo Silva-Ramos, is moving on to focus on the geeks!me wearables brand, announced back in February.Itsfirstproduct  an activity tracker that will also let users monitortheir sex lives  is due tolaunch inthe upcoming months.What happens to Geeksphones code? It says it is open sourcing all the tools that we are legally able to spread so its users can continue development of its software if they wish, although it notes it also has licensing agreements with third parties which mean that some software cannot be madepublic.Existing Geeksphone users will continue to be offered technical support  honoring existing terms of warranty and support of any buyers.In related mobile startup news this week, Finlands Jolla, which makes both itsown handset hardware and its own mobile OS (called Sailfish), has also stepped back from buildingphones. Its dividing into two businesses, with the lions shareofexistingresources going to the new Jolla Ltd which is fully focused on mobile OS development and licensing.Asecond business will apparently be formed to make smart devices later this summer,although it will be much smaller.
