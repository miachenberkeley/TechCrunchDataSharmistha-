Babies are glorious miraculous blessings, but parents trying to get through a good nights sleep with a newborn in the next room may have a tough time remembering that. The NapTime is a new baby monitor that employs Bluetooth-connected, vibrating bracelets to rotate through parental night time duties.When its hubbys turn to change the diaper and soothe the little one back to sleep, his bracelet vibrates to wake him without bothering mommy dearest. And vice versa.The baby can be monitored through a smartphone left in the room, equipped with the NapTime app or a connected Wi-Fi camera. The app can detect the baby crying and send out an alert to wake the appropriate parent. The system can also tell whether or not the bracelets are actually being worn, and will alert the other parent if one isnt wearing the bracelet. In the worst-case scenario, the app will start to call the parents phones (if for some reason both fell asleep without wearing their NapTime bracelets).Obviously, this helps parents trade on and off during the four different trips to the babys room during the night, but also measures the way that your baby is sleeping through the night, giving parents a better idea of when theyll need to get up.The NapTime monitor is up for pre-order TKTKand you can learn more here.
