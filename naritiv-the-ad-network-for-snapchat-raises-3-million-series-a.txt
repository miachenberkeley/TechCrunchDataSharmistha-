Naritiv, the platform that connects brands and advertisers with influencers on Snapchat, has today announced the close of a $3 million Series A led by Third Wave Digital.Investors in the round include Disney, Luminari Capital, Deluxe Entertainment, Wavemaker Partners, and Matthew Anderson (CMO of Roku). Naritiv launched out of the Disney Accelerator, powered by TechStars, in 2014.Naritiv works like this:The company has amassed a network of more than 300 Snapchat stars and influencers  collectively seeing over 1 billion branded views on the platform  who know how to make compelling content on the Snapchat network. They then connect those influencers with brands like ABC Family, Coca-Cola, Redken, and Fox, which are looking to set up campaigns on Snapchat, where the younger demographic is hanging out.Alongside these campaigns, Naritiv also allows these brands to get metrics back on their marketing investment on Snapchat.It sounds relatively simple, but the Naritiv system is far from it. To start, finding Snapchat stars is difficult, as information about them is usually spread via word of mouth. There is no Popular or Trending page on Snapchat, so Naritiv has to work hard to find the biggest influencers on the platform.From there, Snapchat only lets you see views for a story for a single day. Naritiv technology mines all the data from the campaign so that brands can see how their marketing efforts are faring over a long period of time.Naritiv previously raised $1.2 million in seed, bringing total funding to $4.32 million to date, according to Crunchbase.You can learn more about Naritiv here.
