It might not be a planet anymore, but Pluto is fascinating.NASA is just scratching the surface after its Pluto fly-by on July 14th. It says that its retrieved just 5% of the data on the spacecraft, but has already learned new things and snapped some shots unlike anything weve seen before.Heres an amazing farewell shot taken of Pluto, highlighting a newly-discovered haze layer (were essentially seeing its weather for the first time ever):Michael Summers, a part of the New Horizons team said:The hazes detected in this image are a key element in creating the complex hydrocarbon compounds that give Plutos surface its reddish hue.NASA says it has to start from scratch on how it thinks of Plutos atmosphere and weather:Scientists had previously calculated that temperatures would be too warm for hazes to form at altitudes higher than 20 miles (30 kilometers) above Plutos surface. With New Horizons detecting hazes at up to 80 miles (130 kilometers), Were going to need some new ideas to figure out whats going on, said Summers.Heres a true-color image of the surface of Pluto:If you have some time today, jump in and watch the live disclosure of findings:HERE WE GO!
