The natural language query feature takes advantage of HANAs native text analysis ability, which can analyze the words in aquestion and come up with the right answer (at least thats thetheory).This is an extension of the work the twohavebeen doing on the NBA Stats site for the last severalyears. The Stats site actually came online at the All Star game in Houston in 2013.We formed a partnership with SAP in 2012 and have worked in conjunction with them on the development of NBA.com/Stats, an NBA spokesperson told TechCrunch by email.Courtesy of The NBAFans can typequestions like Whos the leading scorer in the NBA this year (StephenCurry) and How many all-star appearances has Dwayne Wade had (12).Sports fans love statistics. They can argue for hours over whos better Curry or LeBron and pull out the numbers to prove it. In fact, the NBA website is chock full of stats, but actually finding what yourelooking for often involves searching for information in a number of ways such as typing keywords in a search box, scanning alphabetical listings or changing the sort order of a chart.Often it requires drilling down through results orscanning chartsfor your answer. This new type of search should help users pinpoint the information theyre looking for.Todays announcementis considered just a starting point. The plan is to continue to develop the natural language features, while leaving other ways to explore stats such as video box scores, player tracking information with SportVU and postgame infographicsin place.Courtesy of The NBAThe natural language search function will continue to evolve. It is important to note that this feature is simply another way for fans to search our official statistics on the site. Fans can still search through the various charts, content and statistical sections we have featured on the site, the NBA spokesperson said.Adding natural language queries should help improve the experience for visitors, and help locate the answers to specific questions, assuming it works as described. We were unable to test the site prior to publishing this report.
