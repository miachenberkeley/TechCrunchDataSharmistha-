The move to live stream the Super Bowlcontinued afterwards, even when other networks like CBSand FOX scored rights to air the game over the past couple ofyears.This years stream event is notable, too, because it marks the first time that NBC has gained the rights to live stream the Super Bowl halftime show, which is set to include performances by Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz.In addition, says Variety, the live stream will include advertisements sold exclusively for digital viewers, combined with some that are airing in the linear TV feed.
