NBCUniversal just announced that it has invested $200 million in Vox Media, which owns sites like Eater, SB Nation and the eponymous Vox.com, as well as tech news publications Re/code and The Verge.Vox Media has a great portfolio of premium digital brands that deeply engage broad audiences, NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke said in the funding release. Vox Media has strong leadership, top editorial talent and a unique technology platform. We are excited to be making this investment and building a collaborative partnership involving editorial content, advertising and technology.The Wall Street Journal and Re/code (which was acquired by Voxearlier this year) both said that the deal values Vox at $1 billion, post-money. An NBCUniversal spokesperson declined to comment on the valuation, and on whether its also investing in BuzzFeed, as Re/code reports.NBCUniversal-owner Comcast previously backed both Vox and Re/code through its Comcast Ventures arm.I suppose the idea of Comcast/NBCUniversal owning a big chunk of two high-profile online media companiesmight seem weirder if I hadnt become a Verizon employee a couple of months ago.
