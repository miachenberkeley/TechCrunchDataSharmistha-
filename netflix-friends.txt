Christmas was about a week ago, but that doesnt mean that the morning of January 1, 2015 doesnt have an awesome surprise in store for you. Starting today, every. single. episode. of Friends is available to stream on Netflix. Go ahead! Celebrate for a minute!Friends is one of those mythical shows that has long been locked out of the new (streaming) world. But that hasnt stopped the sitcom, which is now more than ten years off of the air, from being one of the most beloved and popular shows ever.Cheers to twenty FRIENDS teen. All 10 seasons of #Friends are #NowOnNetflix
