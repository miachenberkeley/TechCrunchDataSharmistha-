Netflix went global earlier this month, and now the U.S. company has said it willcrackdown on customers who use VPN software to access content that is not available or licensed intheir country.Some members use proxies or unblockers to access titles available outside their territory, Netflix said in a statement.In coming weeks, those members using proxies and unblockers will only be able to access the service in the country where they currently are.Many Netflix users  yours truly included  have long paid for the service and accessed it via VPNs fromcountries that werent supported prior to thehuge international expansion. Netflix launching worldwide  in every market but China, Syria, North Korea and the Crimea  opened the serviceto new audiences, buttheres still a good reason to use a VPN: to gain access to thefull Netflix international library rather than limited local selections, as I explained last week.Netflix has traditionally been sympathetic to VPN users, but, now that the stakes are global,it has little option but to push back in order to appease content producers and the licensing agreements it holds with them. That said, policing VPNs is a whack-a-mole game. Content services and VPN software providers are both continually evolving  to use Netflixs term  their technology, so there will almost certainlycontinue to be ways to VPN into global Netflix content, it just wont be as easy as it is right now.Ultimately, Netflix wants to remove the need to ever use a VPN by offering a universal catalog to all users worldwide, regardless of their location. But it admitted that it has a ways to go before we can offer people the same films and TV series everywhere.So, to recap this week  using a VPNto watch Netflixis not ok, but sharing thepassword to a Netflix account is.
