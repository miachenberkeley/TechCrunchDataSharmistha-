Netflix shareholders seem to be in a good mood today  no doubt thanks to the company saying it will launch in 130 new countries.Shares of Netflix spiked immediately after CEO Reed Hastings made the surprise announcement at CES 2016 today, and have continued to climb. Shares ended the day up 9% after climbing throughout the day, clearly showing a lot of confidence in the company now that its setting itself upforwhole new wavefor potential subscribers.The spike represents a little bit of a recovery for the company, which saw its shares crash more than 10 percent after its last earnings announcement. While the company showed strong international growth, it missed expectations fordomestic growth and for the financial performance that investors were seeking.What still remains to be seen is just how much content will be available in those countries. The content thats available differs from country to country, and one of Netflixs biggest strengths is the shows that it produces.In the companys latest earnings report, Netflix said it added 3.62 million new subscribers, with most of those (around 2.74 million) coming from outside the United States. If those numbers are any indicator, the company clearly has a lot of growth potential internationally  making its launch today a big moment for the company.
