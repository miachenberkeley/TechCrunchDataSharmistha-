In the midst of a quest to become an international video streaming success, Netflix has been drawing criticism from core, U.S. customers who say its film and TV library  beyond original series and films  isnt robust enough to whet their viewing appetites.Today, Netflix made an announcement seemingly tailored for these restless U.S. customers, touting a pay TV partnership with Disney, along withforthcoming titles that it will stream first or exclusively throughout the summer.Thepartnership with Disney allows Netflix, as of September, to offer Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm movies during the same window when cable networks like HBO would be allowed to air them, but after Blu-ray and DVD releases.In its video blog post attributed to Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, the company presented a montage of customers complaint-tweets begging Netflix for more scary, Korean, Mickey Mouse, gay, Nicholas Sparks and other movies as well as new TV shows.Sarandos and Netflix thenhighlightednewer and classic films that will be available in itscatalog this summer, including: The Big Short, Hotel Transylvania 2, Spotlight, Goosebumps, the Back to the Future trilogy, the Lethal Weapon franchise, Sixteen Candles and The Wedding Planner.Netflix also reminded users of a spate of forthcoming originals that had already been announced, including a Brad Pitt-starrer, War Machine,and Christopher Guest-directed Mascots.The company isnt just appealing to its existing customer base ahead of the Memorial Day weekend, when viewership on Netflix spikes. It is also telling a story of an improved content offering to institutional investors.The strategy seems to be working for now.
