If youve watched the trailers for the soon-to-be-releasedmovie Steve Jobs, you might remember hearing snatches of a heated conversation between Steve Wozniak and Jobs.Now Universal Pictures has released a clip showing the full exchange, as Wozniak (played by Seth Rogen) demands to know what Jobs (Michael Fassbender) has done to earn his reputation as a genius.I liked the movie, and its been getting largely positive reviews, but if youre on the fence,the scene should give you a good sense of what its actually like. It captures a big part of how Steve Jobs portrays Steve Jobs, with anemphasis on dramatic confrontations and grand speeches.Also, for obvious reasons, I figure this is the scene thats going to get quoted by folks in Silicon Valley. So for easy reference, heres the key bit:Jobs: I play the orchestra. And youre a good musician, you sit right there, youre the best in your row.Steve Jobs opens in limited release on Friday.
