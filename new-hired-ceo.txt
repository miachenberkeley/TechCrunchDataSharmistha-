Theres been a bit of a leadership shuffle at Hired: President Mehul Patel has been promoted to CEO, while the previous CEO, founder Matt Mickiewicz, has become chief product officer.Patel (who has also worked at Lyft, Oracle, CNET and Kaggle, and who joined Hired two years ago), told me this isnt as big a deal as you might think. In fact, he said there was a longtime transition plan in place, and even before the official switch, hed been taking on more and more business responsibilities.Its not a dramatic change, he said. So why make the changenow?All the signs were this model is working and we have product market fit. The growth rate of the business is increasing, so it seemed like a good time to have the CEO transition.Patel actually became CEO back in July, but the company has been relatively quiet about it(though I guess the promotion was apparent to anyone who looked at his LinkedIn page).The company recently hired its first CMO, too  Juney Ham, co-founder and investment advisor of startup Upside.On the growth front, Patel said Hireds revenue has been tripling year-over-year since it was founded in 2012 and is projected to reach a $100 million annualized run rate next year. The serviceisfully launchedin nine cities and in beta testing in another four. And the company it just signed a lease on a 25,000 square foot office in San Franciscos Mid-Market neighborhood.Companies that have used Hired include Facebook, Twitch and Uber. Plus, naturally, Hired itself  Patel estimated that about 95 percent of the engineering team came in through the Hired service.Hired says it screens job candidates through a rigorous process combining algorithms and human curation, so employers dont need to sift through a giant pile of rsums. Candidates are then wooed by the companies with reverse cover letters, they get transparency into compensation and they receive a $2,000 bonus from Hired if they accept a job.The service was initially focused on tech roles, but it has since expanded to sales jobs. Ultimately, Patel said Hired couldbe used for marketers, for human resources, for accounts for architects  all knowledge workers should be able to find a job this way.
