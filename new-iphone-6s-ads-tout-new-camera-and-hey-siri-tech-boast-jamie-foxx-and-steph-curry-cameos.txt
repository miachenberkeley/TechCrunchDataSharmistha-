Apple just unveiled three new ads showing off a fewof the new features on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.Unlike past ads focusing exclusively on the aggressively hipster everyman, these ads feature some major star power.The first ad focuses entirely on the new iPhone 6s camera, as well as the 4k video recording and live photos feature. The ad highlights how the new camera and accompanying apps change how the user is able to take a photo, find a photo, share a photo and more.Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry makes a cameo in this ad as well, showing off both his jump shot and the new slow-motion HD video recordingtech on the 6s.In addition to the camera ad, Apple showed off a couple quick 15-seconds clips of Jamie Foxx demonstrating the Hey Siri functionality of the new iPhones.These ads are definitely lookingto be super cutesy and dont really attempt to show off any real world use cases. Theyre more about getting users used to talking with Siri hands-free, now possible thanks to the new iPhonesM9 motion coprocessor technology that allows Siri to always be ready to chat without ever significantlydraining your battery life.The first one, titled Crush, is a bitweird, though I must say Jamie Foxx and Siri in a Her sequel would make my 2015.The second one, called Flip a coin, is pretty funny, withFoxx asking Siri to flip a coin as he struggles to choose which script to go with.Apples latest iPhones went on sale late last month and beat expectations selling over 13 million devices in theirfirst weekend of sales.
