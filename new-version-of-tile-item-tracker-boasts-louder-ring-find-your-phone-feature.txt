A new version of the bluetooth tracker tagTile just dropped on Amazon, Tiles website and a host of T-Mobile stores. The updated item tracker nowboasts a ring thats three times louder and has added a super dandy new feature called Find Your Phone.I am notorious for losing things amongst my friends, so when Tile launched its successful 2013 Selfstarter campaign (which went on to raise $2.6 million)for its lost item bluetooth tracker, I was quick tocheck outthe device. I wasnt really convinced then based on its limitedfunctionality, but after trying out this new version Ive been won over.The killer feature that was just announced is the Find Your Phone tool. Its basically a hardware shortcut to the apps own version of iOSs Find My iPhone feature. But here, you just double tap the e on yourTile and if your phone is within bluetooth range of the tag(around 100 feet), itll start ringing.In short, now Tile really is the perfect keychain companion.My phone is probably my most frequentlymisplaced itemand going through the hassle of findingit with Find My iPhone when I know that its somewhere in my apartment has been a littlefrustrating, especially when Im rushing out the door. The two-way communication now offered by Tile, basically gives you a way to find two devices with one tag, given that you havent lost both of them that is.Another issue with the original Tile was that its alert ring was just too quiet, especially when the keys I was searching for were stuck muffled by couch cushions. The new Tile has heightened its ring volume to 90 decibels, which makes the item the tag is affixed to much easier to find.The Tile still feels a little bulky. I wish that in its second version it had reduced its footprint a bit to make it easier to, say, put in the credit card slot of a wallet, butits justnot all that comfortableof afit right now.The second iteration of Tile offers some key improvements over its predecessor and while I probably cant attach a Tileto everything in my life, Im a little more confident that I wont be losing my keys and phone quite as much thanks to it.
