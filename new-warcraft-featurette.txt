The Warcraft movie, a fantasy action film based on the popular video game franchise, is coming out next week. To whet your appetite, heres a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal Pictures.The video focuses on Easter eggs on the set for Stormwind Market, suggesting that if youre a regular World of Warcraft player, youll see lots of familiar elements from the game (or at least glimpse them in the corner of the screen).I suppose I should mention that the initial reviews for the film have not been kind. I actually got to watch an early screening and interview Jones, so Ill be writing a bit more about my reaction when I post the interview this weekend. For now Ill just say that Warcraft has its problems, but I liked it a lot more than the reviewers did.The film will go into wide release in the United States on June 10.
