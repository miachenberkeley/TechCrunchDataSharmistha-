Microsoft isnt waiting for next weeks E3 show to start showing off new things  the company revealed a new version of its Xbox One console today, with a matte black paint job and a larger 1TB hard drive built in. This revamped console also allows you to plug in an external USB 3.0 hard drive for even more local storage for games and media content.The new iteration of the Xbox One begins shipping on June 16 in the US, and will arrive in more international markets starting later in the month. Its going to cost $399 when it lands stateside, with 500GB original Xbox One models now permanently selling for $349. An extra $50 for double the storage certainly then looks like an attractive prospect.The new Xbox One also ships with Halo: The Master Chief Collection for a limited time, and includes Microsofts redesigned Xbox One controller, the new default for Xbox systems, including the 500GB versions. It will include a standard 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening over wireless via your existing headphones. Audio can also be louder, and is of higher quality according to Microsoft.Both the new controller and existing ones will also work with the new Wireless adapter for PC systems that works with Xbox One controllers, letting PC gamers cut the cord. That ships this fall, and will retail for $25 on its own, or $75 bundles with one of the new controllers.If Microsoft is pre-announcing this stuff ahead of E3, itll probably have a lot to show off at its keynote next Monday, so stay tuned.
