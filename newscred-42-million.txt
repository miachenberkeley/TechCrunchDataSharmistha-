NewsCred is announcing that it has raised $42 million in additional equity funding.Founded in 2008, the company started out as a system for readers to rate the credibility of every online publication and story. It shifted focus a couple oftimesbefore settling on helping brands find content for their marketing efforts, first by licensing articlesfrom big-name publications, then by connecting those brandswith freelance writers.Customers now include Barclays, Cisco, NASDAQ, Pepsi, ToyotaandVisa. The company says its annualized revenue run rate has tripled in the past year, while the pieces of content created on the platform haveincreased by 182 percent.CEO Shafqat Islam (pictured above with his co-founders Asif Rahman and Iraj Islam) said that a big driver of growth has been NewsCreds software. He described the companys approach as SaaS platform plus marketplace, where the different parts of its business complement each other  brands can use the software to plan and manage their content marketing campaigns, and use the marketplace to actually find the content they need.And yes, content marketing has become a broadly used buzzword (basically, it means promoting your company by creating content thats actually interesting to consumers, rather than just promoting your brand), but Islam said the industry become a much more mature, with chief marketing officers more willing to spend significant money on it.Id say the types of content arechanging, Islamadded. There are some obvious changes like more imagery,more visual content, but I think whats more interesting is the proliferationof channels where content can go.The next step is to continue to expanding the software, so thatbecomes the tool for planning all of a brands marketing efforts, even TV advertising: Youre not going to be able to buy TVads through us any time soon, or ever, but you shouldbe able to do the planning and orchestrating through our system.Our unique edge is that everymarketing channel requires content as its fuel, Islam said.NewsCred has now raised nearly $90 million in funding.
