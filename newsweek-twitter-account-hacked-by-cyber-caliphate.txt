It appears that Newsweeks Twitter account was hacked today by a group calling itself Cyber Caliphate.Around 20 minutes ago, the Newsweek Twitter account began tweeting out images of alleged leaked documents from the DCITA, or the Defense Cyber Investigations Training Academy. Other tweets contained threats against Michelle Obama and her family on Valentines Day.Cyber Caliphate is a relatively unknown hacker group that claims to have a relationship to ISIS, and calls themselves the CyberJihad. The main message, tweeted out as an image of text, says:While the US and its satellites are killing our brothers in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, we are destroying your national cybersecurity system from inside.The message goes on to say that the Islamic State is already here and that ISIS is much closer than you think.Newsweek seems to have taken back control of the account for now.The Cyber Caliphate group also claimed responsibility for the hacking of the Malaysia Airlines website in late January.This comes fresh on the heels of news that President Obama is forming a new agency developed specifically to improve our cyber security defenses and intelligence.[IMG via BuzzFeed News Twitter]Additional reporting by Sarah Perez
