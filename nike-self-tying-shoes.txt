Ive spent a lot of time over the past few days with the folks at Nike, who were showing off a whole bunch of new and upcoming products at their Innovation for Everybody event.The big attention-getter was the HyperAdapt 1.0  namely, self-tying shoes. Nike had already toyed with the idea of emulating Back To The Future Part II by announcing limited edition, self-lacing Nike Mags with star Michael J. Fox. HyperAdapt, however, is set to be the first mass-production shoe with these capabilities, and its scheduled for release during this coming holiday season.Nike also showed off a new Nike+ app thats meant serve as your main entry point to the Nike world  Nikes Nikki Neuburger described it as the all-access point to unlock your potential.
