Nintendo just announced that its bringingNintendo 64 and Nintendo DS consoles to the Wii Us Virtual Console, its app that lets you play older games through software emulation.Nintendo 64 titles have been surprisingly absent from the Wii Us Virtual Console, given that 21 of them were available on the consoles predecessor. Wii U owners could still access those original titles by launching their console into a separate Wii interface, but the experience was far from ideal.The addition of Nintendo DS titles is also long-awaited. When the Wii U launched with a giant touchscreen and stylus in its main controller, most assumed DS Virtual Console support was right around the corner. Now Nintendo says its going to support several layouts to emulate the dual-screen interface, letting you send the top screen to your TV while you use the controller as the bottom half of the DSor keeping everything on the Wii U remote, like so:Nintendo DS and Nintendo 64 Virtual Console is finally here.
