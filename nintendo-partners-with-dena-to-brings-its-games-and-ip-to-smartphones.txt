Nintendo is finally bringing its games and characters to mobile after the company surprised the tech world withan alliance with Japanese mobile gaming firm DeNA.The duo announceda collaboration that will see themjointly develop games for smart devices. Secondly,a service that lets users play games across a variety of devices, including mobile devices, PCs and Nintendos own consoles like the 3DS and Wii U is slated to launch in the fall of 2015.Nintendo said that it will create new titles from the ground up, rather than porting existing games from its consoles so as to ensure the quality of game experience that consumers expect from the coming together.In what may be music to Nintendo fans  like this one  the companies said thatall Nintendo IP will be eligible for development and exploration by the alliance.That said, the duo will not flood the market with vast numbers of games, the approach appears to be qualitative rather than quantitative.At a joint-press conference, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata revealed that talks began as early as the summer of 2010, but became more concrete last year. Iwata admitted that Nintendo wasnt able to transition to its handheld consolesas smoothly as expected. He denied that the growth of mobilemeans that the business of dedicated games consoles is deadbut said it would be a waste to not look at opportunities with smartphones.We have come to hold a stronger passion and vision for the video games console with this decision, Iwata said. Essentially,he believes that compelling mobile games can act as a bridge thatpushesmore consumers to buy dedicated Nintendo games consoles.The alliance will see both sides make 22 billion yen ($181 million investments) in each other. That corresponds to around 10 percent of DeNA stock for Nintendo, while DeNA is picking up1.24 percent of Nintendo.Founded in 1999,DeNA may be less known outside of Asia, but it is a multi-billion dollar mobile games firmin its own right. It initially emerged with the growth of web-based mobile games in Japan and its Mobage service, but over the past few years it has transitioned into apps making acquisitions along the way, including the $400 million purchase of Ngmoco, and social games maker Punch.That transition hasnt been easy for the company, particularly with competition from thegrowth of new, dedicated mobile gaming firms that have focused on apps from day one. DeNAs most recent financials saw revenue dip 17 percent year-on-year to$287 million. Operating profit was down 55 percent to $43 million, so its fair to say that this tie-in with Nintendo couldbe a very important turning point.
