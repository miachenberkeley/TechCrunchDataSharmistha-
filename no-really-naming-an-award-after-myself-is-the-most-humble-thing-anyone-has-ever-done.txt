Merry Christmas! 2015 was a truly great year in technology, bringing us self-driving electric cars, reusable orbital rockets, the rise of precision gene editing and some lesser achievements. Since nothing of interest will happen in the next four days, I have decided to jump the gun; today I announce my annual dubious achievement awards, named, in a fit of awe-inspiring humility, after myself.And so, with little further ado, heavily inspired by The Sids, I give you the eleventh thirteenth eighty-seventh first annual Jon Awards for Dubious Technical Achievement! Not yet as prestigious as The Crunchies, true. But give em time.THE FOOT-IN-MOUTH-AND-KNIFE-IN-HAND AWARD FOR MALAPROPIC ONTOLOGYTo Sean Rad of Tinder, for saying sodomy when he meant sapiosexual, and then, in the very same interview, personally attacking a journalist rather than her work.Tinder CEO Sean Rad is looking for intellectualism or sodomy, not sure which. https://t.co/hBxHveVKTP pic.twitter.com/UXUaznm0zu Gawker (@Gawker) November 18, 2015Tinder CEO insults @nancyjosales for doing journalism. theres some stuff about her as an individual"

All recipients shall receive a bobblehead of myself made up as a Blue Man, as per the image on this post,1 which will doubtless become coveted and increasingly valuable collectibles. And, of course, all winners shall be remembered by posterity forevermore.1Bobbleheads shall only be distributed if and when available and convenient. The eventual existence of said bobbleheads is not guaranteed or indeed even particularly likely. Not valid on days named after Norse or Roman gods.
