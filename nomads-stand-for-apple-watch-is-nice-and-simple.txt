The Apple Watchs charging puck is, in itself, pretty versatile and fool-proof when it comes to connecting your smartwatch to power over night. But theres always room for improvement, and the Nomad Stand offers that, with a minimal approach thats optimal for bedside or desktop use.Nomads approach to a charging accessory for Apple Watch is beautifullybasic, consisting of a single piece of aircraft-grade aluminum. The aluminum is machined to have a looping curve, with a hole cut out to hold the stock Apple Watch charging puck, and a channel around the back edge of the device through which to feed the cable. The only additional parts on the Stand are a rubber footpad to prevent it sliding all over your table surface, and a copper plate hidden beneath that to provide ballast to make it even more shift-proof.The Stand comes in either standard aluminum or space gray, which makes it a good match for either of the Sport versions of the Apple Watch. It works with both the 1 and 2 meter flavors of the Apple Watch charging stand, and is compatible with both 38 and 42mm case sizes of Apple Watch.While the Stand isnt alone in its approach to providing a support surface for Apple Watch charging (a simple Google search will reveal a litany of devices that uses a similar channel + existing cable model), nor is it the cheapest, it does appear to be one of the better-designed accessories available in this category. The continuous curve used by Nomad is both subtle and striking, meaning its actually additive to home decor when placed atop a night stand, instead of looking like yet another piece of techie gadget creep.The Nomad Stand is available now for $59.95, with an anticipated ship date of May 29th.
