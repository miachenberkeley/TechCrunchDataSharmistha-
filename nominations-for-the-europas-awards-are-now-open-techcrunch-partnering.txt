If you are not a startup founder, then you need to purchase a ticket in the investor/service provider category.The Judges for this years awards will be announced soon.(This year we are using AngelList to manage the application process for the startups, as many will already have profiles on the site, thus saving them lots of time over the old process. We hope this will also help create more visibility for startups amongst investors, should they need that. Please note that The Europas is an awards event and conference, not an investor).The Europas will be accompanied by a parallel track called PathFounders, the exclusive event for startup Founders, in particular those at an early stage and/or fund-raising. Also invitation-only, PathFounders will bring together Founders and Investors in a series of exclusive networking experiences, on the day before The Europas. This will see around 100 of Europes hottest early-stage Founders, come together with Europes best VCs and Angel Investors in a relaxed environment, with amazing hospitality. Tickets to PathFounders will open up at a later stage and will be an upgrade ticket for existing Europas attendees.Once invited to attend, all tickets must be paid-for by invitees. The entire event is hand-curated to create the right mix of awesome founders, investors, media and eco-system players.Contacts:
