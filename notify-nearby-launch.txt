At this point, weve probably all heard (or experienced!) the scenario where youre walking past a store and your phone buzzes to alert you about nearby deals. The challenge, though, is sending amessage thats actually interesting, useful and maybe even exciting, rather than annoying.Nevin Jethmalani, co-founder and CEO of Notify Nearby, said hes had that experience himself  he was driving to a friends house and, thanks to Shopkick, Some random company sent me a push notification.I thought, This is just terrible, this is a reason I would uninstall this app,' Jethmalani said.So hes trying to deliver a better experience with the Notify Nearby iPhone app, which launched earlier this week. (The Android app is coming soon.)Like pretty much every location-based marketing startup, Notify Nearby uses beacon technology and location data to show you nearby deals, but the key here is that youre following the brands that you choose  companies currently in the app include Tory Burch, Saks Fifth Avenue and Levis.Once youve opted in, you should be able to follow all the fashion brands that interest you. Some of those brands are actively posting, while in others have given Notify Nearby permission to post content that theyve shared elsewhere.Asked what kind of content will succeed, Jethmalani acknowledged, Of course, because of the way human nature is, promotions will do the best. But strong pieces of content [can include] product launches, new collaborations, exclusives. If someone posts a product launch to our app, thats something people are going to find really appealing.The beacon functionality may be the cool new thing, but the apps beacon integrations are mostly in New York for now. (We cant just saturate the country with beacons.)But even without those features, everyoneelse can still use Notify Nearbyto follow brands and see their latest content.
