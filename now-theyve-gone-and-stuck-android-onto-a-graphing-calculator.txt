Today in our ongoing series of people putting one thing into another thing, we present Android running on a Texas Instruments TI-Nspire CX, a robust graphing calculator popular with the pre-calc set.The calculator has about 100MB of storage and 64MB of RAM but has enough power to run Android 1.6 aka Donut. Obviously youre not going to make very many calls using your graphing calculator but the creator, Josh Max, has added Wi-Fi functionality and keyboard support.Now Max just has to strap on an Apple Watch running Mac OS 7.5.5 and maybe run an Atari 2600 emulator on his laptop and he can be the king of outmoded technologies.via AndroidPolice
