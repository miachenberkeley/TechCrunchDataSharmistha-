If youre a WhatsApp user  and the chances are high since more than one billion people open the app each month  you might be interested to know that the chat app just added some neat new formatting options. Now you can use bold, italics and strikethrough in your messages with friends and family.These tricks, a rare update that might actually (slightly) change how people use WhatsApp, are pretty easyto master:These new stylings can also be entered in the WhatsApp web client  which launched last year  but the formatting will only show up in the app-based version of chats.WhatsApp hasnt introduced too many new features since its launch, aside from voice calls, with the team preferring to keep things simple. Thats quite unlike other messaging apps, which have added payments, bots, games, official accounts, stickers and many more features to provide increased functionality.But we might be about to see the first move to turn the WhatsApp messaging app into a platform. Facebook, which acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion two years ago, recently revealed plans to enable business accounts inside the app, thereby allowing users to connect with companies with which they want to communicate via the service. That hasnt happened yet, but it could become a realityvery soon  perhaps at Facebooks upcoming F8 conference.Either way,messaging is sure to be a big part of F8, with Facebook likely to unveil its bot initiative for Messenger, the other blockbuster app that the social network giant owns. At this point though, it looks like WhatsApp will continue to remain the more basic chat app, with Messenger likely to become a more sophisticated and feature-rich service in a similar way topopularmessaging apps in Asia like Chinas WeChator Line in Japan.Thanks Dan
