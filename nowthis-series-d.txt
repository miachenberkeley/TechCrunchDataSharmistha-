PreviousbackersOak Investments, NBC News Group and Softbank also participated.We are increasing our share in a promising journalistic start-up that is focusing on the attractive future market of mobile and social video consumption, said Jens Mffelmann, CEO of Axel Springer Digital Ventures, in the funding release.The essence of NowThis strategy is illustrated by visiting the startups homepage. Instead of featuring news videos, it simply declares, Homepage. Even the world sounds old. and links to NowThis accounts on services like YouTube and Facebook. The company takes the distributed media model exemplified by BuzzFeed to an extreme, posting short news videos that are optimized foreach platform, and not worrying about driving traffic back to its own website. (The BuzzFeed similarity is probably no coincidence  Kenneth Lerer is chairman of both companies.)While we have seen phenomenal growth on Facebook over the past year, we are also seeing significant growth among many of the other social platforms, Stephanopoulos said. This funding will allow us to both aggressively lean in on opportunities around video on Facebook, while expanding our content offering on other platforms.The company said it crossed 200 million total views in May, and its sped past that milestone, now reaching 700 million monthly views. Sixty-eight percent of thataudience is between the ages of 18 and 34. Its also expanding by launching more focused channels, like NowThis Entertainment, NowThis Future and NowThis Weed.
