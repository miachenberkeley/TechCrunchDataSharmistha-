Youget to choose the name of Googles next Android release.Traditionally, every Android release is named after something sweet: Marshmallow, Lollipop, KitKat, Jelly Bean, etc.Previews are always named afterthe next letter in the alphabet at first (N, in the case of the latest release); Google then announces the fullname shortly before the final release.This time, the rumor mill suggested that Android N would stand for Nutella. Maybe it still will, but just as Google surprised everybody with its early release of Android N, its also switching up the naming process.Instead of the usual top-down approach, Googletoday announcedit will run a contest to name the next version of Android.When I told Google VP of Engineering Dave Burke that this sounded like a bad idea, given the whole Boaty McBoatface issue a few weeks ago, he noted that the company still reservesthe right to pick the final name.Google already ran an Android N naming poll a few months ago, too. At the time, the suggested names included Napoleon, Nougat and Nori.I, for one, cant wait to see what terrible name the Internet decides on, only for Google to then dismiss it.
