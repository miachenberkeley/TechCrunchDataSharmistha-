At a post-GDC keynote at the Nob Hill Masonic Center, Nvidia co-founder and CEOJen-Hsun Huang just took to the stage for a series of big announcements. The video processing technology company today unveiled its plan to further its push into user hardware with a $199Shield, a set-top box running Android TV that will launch in May.The new game console isnt too far of a stretch for Nvidia  the company already makes an Android-based gaming handheld as well as a high-end tablet. In fact, TechCrunchs Darrell Etherington speculated that tonights announcement could include a console based solely on hints of the invitation to come and our discussion on the DroidCast podcast.At the beginning of the announcement, it seemed that Nvidia was going to announce a TV and a game console  instead, the new Shield looks more like Razers Forge TV.Several minutes into the unveiling, the company focusedon the non-gaming media aspects of the device. Most of the demo thus far has shown navigating the Android interface using a remote that looks like what you get with a Roku or Amazon Fire TV, with built-invoice input, with an occasional pause to gawk at the 4K footage being shown on the main stages display.When it finally started talking about how the Shield would be used by the companys gamer audience, the keynotefocused on the power of the of the Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, which Nvidia unveiled at CES in January. As a simple point of comparison, Huang noted that the X1s GPU has more than twice the processing power of the Xbox 360 while consuming between 1/20th and one-fifth as much electricity as the last-gen console.Most Android games arent going to push that kind of silicon very hard, so Nvidia also showed off the Shield Store, a collection of high-end games brought over to the platform, including previous Shield games like Half-Life 2 as well as more recent, demanding games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.We were also briefly shown Borderlands, The Talos Principle, a version of Doom 3, and Crysis 3 multiplayer performing with surprising quality and smoothness on stage. Huang says the Shield will support with more than 50 native titles and facilitate access to Nvidias GRID service when it launches later this year.
