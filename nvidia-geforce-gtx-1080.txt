While you were out enjoying your Friday night, NVIDIA kicked off the weekend with a surprise unveil at the DreamHack gaming event in Austin to debut its latest gaming GPUs.CEO Jen-Hsun Huang took to the stage at the citys Emos music venue to showcase the GeForce GTX 1080, the companys first Pascal-based GPU, which promises double the performance and three times the power efficiency of its current top dog, the Titan X.Oh, and its about $400 less expensive than that $1,000 card.Huang called the new card insane, adding that the performance was almost irresponsible, perhaps referring, in part, to the several billion dollar, two-year research and development process he says went into the project.Due May 27, the GTX 1080 packs nine teraflops of computational power and 8GB of GDDR5X memory. According to NVIDIAs numbers, the cards Boost clock is capable of over 1700MHz, but an Unreal Engine 4 demo at the event pushed it over 2000MHz.The system is designed to meet the increasing needs of multi-monitor ultra high-def gaming and virtual reality systems, boosting the power while dropping the entry price.Speaking of which, the company also made mention of the even more affordable GTX 1070 which is set to run $379 when it arrives on June 10. That cheaper unit still outpaces the Titan, with 6.5 teraflops and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM.
