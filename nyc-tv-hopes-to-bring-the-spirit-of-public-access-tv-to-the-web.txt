Hey, remember public access? Those local, non-commercial channels where youd find weird stuff (and, sure, city council meetings) thatmade you think, Wait, how is this even on TV?Well, public access hasnt gone away (heck, its become Stephen Colberts temporary home), but Kareem Ahmed, co-founder and CEO of a new video startup called NYC.TV argued that theres no real equivalent on the web.Ahmed previously worked as director of audience development and growth strategy editor at The New York Times, while his co-founders Alexandra Serio and Max Nelson worked at Vice and Vox, respectively  so theyve got experience with the world of online media and video. What they want to do here, Ahmedsaid, is bring back the spirit of public access: We saw an opportunity for an independent media platform that not only funded and distributed media, but also fostered a sense of community.But, uh, what about YouTube? The video supersitecertainly has the anyone can broadcast ethos of public access, resulting in unique content that would (probably?) never make it onto traditional TV.The challenge, however, is actually getting people to watch. Ahmed said that from a viewers perspective, theres simply too much video to sift through, while from a creators perspective, it can be frustrating to put a lot of time and energy into something and only get a few hundred views.You cant just throw it on YouTube  thats not how it works anymore, he said.The team is hoping to fund its efforts through a $50,000 Kickstarter campaign. While NYC.TV is a for-profit company, Ahmed said the money will go to support the creators  70 percent will pay for content, 20 percent will go to distribution and promotion, and the final 10 percent is marked for backend development  though even there, the company says, This will actually probably end up going to marketing.As I write this, the campaign is still more than $10,000 a way from its goal, with about 48 hours left to go.
