President Obama has just released the list of appointees to the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity  and its more or less what youd expect: higher-ups from the big players in tech, plus some academics and the former director of the NSA. Wait, what?Yes, General Keith Alexander (Retired), who headed the NSA during the enormous expansion of its surveillance apparatus  pointed, of course, at you  is the first listed member of the commission. On the one hand, better the devil you know, and what a resum. On the other, wow.The rest of the members are as follows, with their primary or most recent affiliation listed:So what does this commission do, exactly? Its part of Obamas larger overhaul of government tech policy, the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, announced earlier this year. In fact, its the first highlight on the administrations summary of CNAP.Ironically, the members were announced on the same day a bill was proposed that, if this commission is worth its salt, will be the subject of their very first recommendation. That is to say, to bury that bill so deep that theyll need ultrasonic locators like they used at the beginning of Jurassic Park to find it again. Actually, that probably wont be necessary (the bill is a dud), but it sure would be nice to watch.The specific details on exactly what the commission will be doing are here. If all goes according to plan, a final report will be due to the president by December 1 of this year, leaving him just enough time to not implement it. I kid, but really, no sweeping reforms were likely at any time during this acrimonious election season, so this gives them time to do real research and, probably, establish their own sub-commissions.Periodic public meetings are also part of the plan, so keep an eye out for those  you wouldnt want to miss a chance to make your voice heard, would you?
