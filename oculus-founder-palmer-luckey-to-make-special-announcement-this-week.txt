At this weeks Game Awards in Los Angeles, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is scheduled to attend and make an announcement of some sort, its host announced today on Twitter:Don't miss @thegameawards for a special announcement from @oculus founder @PalmerLuckey https://t.co/Ui4UR1nhVR Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) November 30, 2015Itll be interesting to see what Luckey has to say and announce, and if I had to guess, it would have something to do with general availability of the Oculus Rift, the flagship virtual reality device that is set to arrive sometime in early January next year. Some hardcore gamers are holding out for the next step up from the Oculus DK2 instead of grabbing the Samsung Gear VR, which Ive described as Oculus light.Maybe a ship date? Features and functionality? Launch titles? Any or all would be lovely.If you want to watch from home, The Game Awards are on this Thursday and will be streamed on YouTube and Twitch.Have the scoop? Drop us an anonymous tip forthwithly.UPDATE: Palmer Luckey took to Twitter to hush rumors. Apparently the announcement wont be about pre-orders for the Rift. Darn.Really cool announcement happening at The Game Awards!  (Not preorders opening) Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) November 30, 2015
