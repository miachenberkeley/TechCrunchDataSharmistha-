Freak out, everyone, Microsoft intends to update its software. That it said it would update. That it said it wouldupdate on a continuous basis. Because its trying to build and release Windows 10 as a service. So its going to push new code.LOSE YOUR SHIT.Kidding. But really, Im slightly confused. I had to spend the morning on trains to meet an unelected political official, so Im late to this, but I couldnt make the following up if I tried:New terms in Windows 10, as the aforelinked post notes, include the following:The Software periodically checks for system and app updates, and downloads and installs them for you.You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorised sources, and Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with those updates.By accepting this agreement, you agree to receive these types of automatic updates without any additional notice.This should surprise absolutely no one. Microsoft cannot push updates to enterprise-level customers, as they are tetchy bastards who wish Windows XP still worked. Microsoft can and will push updates to consumers to ensure that their operating system is secure, and full of the latest doodads that it hopes will grow the userbase of its services.When the company dropped the most recent build of Windows 10, it said the following:This is going to be an exciting couple of weeks, but it is also only the beginning.Windows as a service means that well continue to keep Windows up to date with improvements and features, and our Windows Insider Program will continue so you can get early builds and share your feedback with us.So, theres that.And I dont think that we have to be too worried about Big Windows taking down our PCs with updates, since weve seen how the company has comported itself thus far in the Windows 10 saga. Have the new versions ofWindows 10 been horrific debacles, fraught with bugs and generally lessening code quality?Not really.Keep in mind that this is not iTunes that we are talking about.
