This year is shaping up to be an interesting one for tech media in Asia. Singapore-based E27 is the latest technology-focused blog from the region to raise funding, after it closed a $650,000 bridge round ahead of a planned larger raisebefore the end of2015.Founded in 2006, E27 runs a site that reportstech and startup news fromAsiaand a complementary events business which includes its flagship two-dayEchelon conference this year sponsored by Braintree. TechCrunch understands from multiple sources that this fresh capital, which comes fromexisting investors, was raised with the aim of closing a larger round  in the region of $3 million before the year is out.E27 co-founder and CEO Mohan Belani confirmed the new fundingto TechCrunch, but declined to provide specific details about it andhowit will be spent.Were hunkering down and focused on what we believe is right for the ecosystem, Belani said in an interview. The entire media industry is going through an interesting evolution, were learning what works best for our ecosystem.E27 previously raised a $615,000 funding round in 2013, and counts a bevy of VC firms in Southeast Asia among its investors, including8capita Partners,Ardent Capital,B Dash Ventures, andPinehurst Advisors.The timing of this funding  and the targeted later round  comes afterE27s closest rival,Tech In Asia, which graduatedY-Combinator this year,raised $4 million to develop its site into a community hub for Asias tech industry. That focus seesTech In Asia shift froma straight-up tech news blog  in the style of E27, and us here at TechCrunch  to a website that includes user-generated content (UGC) and materials for the community prominently on its homepage.While that has included some interesting content  particularly the Ask Me Anything features  and TechCrunch understands that it hasprovided a notableboost intraffic, it hasnt come without teething problems. Weveheard many high-profile figuresin Asias tech ecosystem voiceconcernthat the general quality of content on the site has dropped following theintroductionof UGC. That could be a problem if it is an opinion held widely within the very industry that Tech In Asia seeks to serve.That change in focus could also leave the door open for E27 to capitalize and invest inits reporting chops todifferentiate itself from Tech In Asia as a source of news. Indeed, that differentiation could help E27 increase its circulation numbers, which sources close to the company told TechCrunch are significantly below the 2.4 million monthly pageviews that Tech In Asiarecently claimed it receives across its websites. (E27 declined to provide these details when asked by TechCrunch.)At this point though, we will have to waitto seewhether the proposed $3 million round will arrive for E27 and, if and when it does, which investors will be involved, as that is likely toshape how the money is spent.Tech In Asia and E27 arent the only tech-focused blogs duking it out in Asia, beyond us at TechCrunch, of course. Digital News Asia, a site founded by old school print journalists, raised $300,000 last year, while Deal Street Asia has invested in growing its reporting team to cover stories across the region beyond merely those in tech. (That includesa recent reportthat E27 is up to for sale  however that is something that multiple sources close to E27 toldus is untrue.)Slightly further geographically afield, News Corp acquired VC Circle, an India-based media company running a tech news site and events business, in March.Ironically, the fact that a close rival was able to raise $4 million may help convince investors that E27 is a good investment and that media businesses in Asia have plenty of room to grow, not to mention that there is exit potential.Either way, Belani isnt saying anything more for now.At this moment, Im pretty focused on running the company and working with our users to help them better connect with Asias tech ecosystem, he told us.
