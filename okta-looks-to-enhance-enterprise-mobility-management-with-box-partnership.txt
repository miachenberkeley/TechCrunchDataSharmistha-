Okta, a companymostly known for cloud identity management, made a forayinto enterprise mobility management(EMM)at the end of 2014. Today, it announced a partnership with Box to supportdevice-level security for the Box mobile app.The company is hoping this is the start of a seriesof partnerships with enterprise mobile app vendors that will enable them toapply a set of policies on the device, such as requiring a device PIN before you can use any of the managed apps.Oktas EMMsolution also includes integrated identity across participating apps with Single Sign-On (SSO) along withunified provisioning across all devices, according to the company.Okta and Box have a long history together but this expands the friendship, Okta CEO Todd McKinnon told TechCrunch.The thing that is significant is that its a technology partnership around mobility and mobility management, which is an extension of our long businesspartnership, he said.While Box has always handled security at the application level, this separates the security from the app, McKinnon said. Were going from security on an app to security and identity being applied consistently on all apps, he explained.Without this approach, each app has to handle security and identity separately instead of in a federated way. Of course, it ultimately requires that more than Box sign up, but Box CEO Aaron Levie says that he believesthat will happen.Im very confident that they will get the support they need to make this successful, he said, adding hes very comfortable being an early adopter for these new capabilities.All of those controls [are designed to] ensure secure access in a mobile world. Its an evenmore profound shift from cloud to mobile than from client-server to cloud, and its even more important to control access and what apps can run on different [mobile] platforms, Levie said.As we move from a world of a few vertical stacks to one of multiple cloud vendors, many running on mobile devices, Levie believes having that federated security and identity is increasingly critical.Box works with a number of vendors in this space including Okta.Okta is currently in discussion with other enterprise mobile appvendors to expand this program, McKinnon said.Okta has raised almost $230 million including $75 million last summer. It also scoreda unicorn valuation of over $1 billion with that money,and its still listed on the CrunchBase Unicorn Leaderboard.
