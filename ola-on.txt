Last year saw Indias taxi-hailing app war heat up after Uber landed in the countryandSoftBank invested intop domestic player Ola. With the competition set toonly increase this year, Ola has come out of the blocks quickly in 2015 after it announced that it is now present in 50 cities, with plans to reach 200 by the end of this year.To give that expansion some context, Ola was present in 19 cities back in October when SoftBank led a$210 million funding round which valued the startup at $1 billion. All in all, it has expanded to 40 new locations  predominantly tier-two and three cities  in the past five months.Ola originally projected that it would reach 75cities in India by March, and it is now rewriting other targets it had set.We had planned to be in 100 cities by 2016, but that looks very achievable now so we should probably look at doing a lot more  maybe 200,Anand Subramanian, Olas head of communications, told TechCrunch in an interview.To further illustrate the impact of the SoftBank-led round, Olas CEO was shooting for 25 cities by the end of 2015, when I talked to him last July.Another point of reference: Uber is inover 140 cities in the U.S., and just over 250 worldwide. So 200 in India alone is a lot.Banglore remains Olas largest city based on customer demand, but, with its reach now extended into more rural parts of the country, Ola is pushing itself the first pan-India taxi-on-demand service.Were seeing a tremendous response to our expansion, Anand Subramanian, Olas head of communications, told TechCrunch in an interview. Our growth in smaller cities has been insane.Four-year-old Ola and other domestic rivals got a massive headstart on Uber, which came to India in June 2014 and is in 13 cities at the time of writing. ButSubramanian claimedthat local firms have a different, more local approach than theirinternational competitors.Beyond offering a hotline and other ways to book a ride for those without smartphones,he points to Olas success in converting its drivers into entrepreneurs  thats industry speak for thosewho own their vehicle outright.Ola began offering financing plans  which give drivers better rates and packages to purchase cars outright  nearly one year ago, and it claimsthat 70 percent of the 60,000 drivers on its platform have used it. Uber introduced its own version in India in November, with the countrybecoming thefirst expansion of the program outsideof the U.S..Olaclaimed it is adding1,000 new cars to its platform each day, but it is cagier on raw customer numbers.Subramanian declined to reveal the number of downloads of its apps or its registered user number, but he did say itis serving200,000 rides on its platform per day.Olahas also been bulking up its staff numbers too, and it has close to 2,500 employees right now. There has been plenty of ink spilt ontaxi app companies spreading themselves too thinly in a bid to grow their businesses quickly in India  thats certainly one factor that may have contributed to the tragic rape of an Uber passenger in New Delhi last year.That incident was a wake-up call for all of Indias transportation on-demand companies, not just Uber.Subramanian explained that Ola has taken a number steps to solidifythe security and safety measures within its service, including the addition of a second layer of GPS covering all drivers.He added thatOlas presence in each city is matched by at least 10-15 staff (or more than 100 busiermarkets), while each driver has a dedicated account manager to liaise with.In terms of background checks, he said the company is working with authorities and police to ensure all drivers are verified, and other agencies for full life cycle checks.Uber similarly pledged to introduce additional safety features and work more closely with authorities, following a ban on unlicensed taxi-app services in New Delhi last month.Another new addition coming soon to Ola is a dedicated service for female passengers, staffed byfemale drivers.Subramanian said Ola Pink, which is currently in a limited betain Bangalore, is not a direct response to the Uber rape incident, but rather a different choice for female customers. The service is likely to launch in more cities soon, but for now Ola isnt saying too much more about it.Beyond expanding the scope and range of its service, Ola is looking to generate wider awareness of what it does. It is putting its new funding round to use with its first paid media push.TheChalo Niklo campaign which roughly means get me out of here  featuresnational TV ad spots (including the clip below) and covers radio, print and outdoor media.Subramanian said it is designed to highlightthe spontaneity that a customer demands for transport as a service  and it is interesting to see thatOla is the latest tech company  following messaging app Hike, among others  to use offline, national channels to growawareness beyond early adopters and tech fans.As for working with SoftBank,Subramanian hinted that there is plenty more to come although he declined to reveal specifics.SoftBank brings phenomenal insight for emerging markets, support and network. We look forward to a lot of collaboration on their side, he commented.With Uber putting the$2.5 billion-odd that it raised rom investors last year to took with aggressive pricing and promotions, regional players like Ola will certainly need all the tactical and financial help they can get.Uber has focused on serving a premium audience in India to date, and to that end its service is present in Indias largest cities. Ola has responded to its rivals aggressive pricing in India, but it appears to be accelerating its expansion as quickly as possible  backed by itsrecent funding to get first mover advantage in Indias smaller cities.Thats all well and good for now, since Uber doesnt have anything like that reach, but it is inevitable that the U.S. firm will spread itself further in India as time goes by.While it is currently dealing with the repercussions of the New Delhi rape  including a delicate relationship with authorities, who were quick to issue a knee jerk ban of its service  Uber has serious plans for Asia, andIndia appears to be its primaryfocus in the region.Its most recent $1.2 billion funding round was earmarked for Asia Pacific growth, and it is prepared to go beyond just serving high-end consumers. Thats evidenced by the recent launch of Uber Go, a chauffeured hatchback service thatcompetes with Indias ubiquitous fleets of cheapauto rickshaws, and the (albeit forced) introduction of a payment wallet that lets customers pay with cash and other methods beyond just credit cards.The diversity of its service and support for different payment types were two points Ola previously stressed as competitive advantages, but the U.S. company has caught up  and thats what it will keep doing.Ola may be ahead on overall geographical coverage of India right now, but this race is amarathon  albeit a marathonthat is being run at the pace ofa sprint.Image of Rickshaws via Shutterstock
