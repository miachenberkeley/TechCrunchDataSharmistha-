Ola, the SoftBank-backed competitorto Uber, hasdished out $200 million to buysmaller rivalTaxiForSure in what looks like being the first of a number of consolidation moves inIndias taxi-hailing space.The deal  which has been speculated for months, and is based oncash and equity  should significantly increase Olas position as the widest-reaching taxi app service in India, although bothservices will operate under their own brands.Ola currently claims to offer 100,000 vehicles across 67 cities in the country, and to that number it will add TaxiForSures 15,000 vehicles across 47 cities. In contrast, Uber serves 11 cities in India, offering mainly higher-priced, premium-marketed rides  although it does havea budget Go service.There had been rumorsabout the future of TaxiForSures founders, and the companies confirmed today that co-foundersAprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G will contribute in an advisory role for a certain period. Their tenure may well be brief, but TaxiForSures 1,700 staff will stay with the company, which will be helmed by Arvind Singh who is stepping up from COO to CEO.Theres a lot of complementary value in the strategy TaxiForSure has followed. Im very excited to welcome the TaxiForSure team onboard and look forward to working with them towards realising our common vision, said Ola CEOBhavish Aggarwal in a statement.This isnt the first deal of this kind in India. Last month, Chinas top two taxi-hailing companies  Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache  announced a merger. They too willoperate as separate entities.Interestingly, these two deals have an investor in common: SoftBank. We noted earlier this year that the Japanese telecom gianthas fast become Ubers chief competitor across Asia with a series of investment deals. Beyond Ola, and Kuaidi Dache, SoftBank is also a major stakeholder in GrabTaxi, which rivals Uber in Southeast Asia, viaa $250 million funding deal.
