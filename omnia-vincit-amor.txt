In her book Lean In, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg implores young women to make [their] partner a real partner or, to make your spouse someone with a vested interest in your success.Sandberg called picking the right significant other the most important career choice you could make, and she was right: After all it is much easier to rebound from a stressful work day when someone has picked up some of the slack, for starters.Sandbergs husband, SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg, was this kind of real partner. Through Lean In, he inspired eventhose who never knew him directly to make better partner choices  because he lived his life in full support of Sandberg. Sadly, he passed away this past May, after an accident in Mexico.That has not kept Sandberg from doubling down on his memory and continued success. Today she announced that she is joining the board of SurveyMonkey along with her former Facebook colleague David Ebersman, guiding the company Goldberg helmed as it nudges towards IPO. Along with Sandberg and Ebersman, the SurveyMonkey board now has seven members, two of them women.While spouses serving on the same board is not uncommon, its rarer when those spouses are not co-founders of the same company, like in the case of Houzz or Eventbrite. (Check outthis special situation.)One could also argue that significant others are always on each others board: Which means that Sandberg leads once again in making that official.I've never felt emotional about a board appointment before but there you go. https://t.co/HyIvh6KSnA Ashley Mayer (@ashleymayer) July 7, 2015
