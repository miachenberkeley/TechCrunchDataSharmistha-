Cleanly, the YC-backed on-demand company focused on handling your laundry (and dry-cleaning) as soon as you need it done, has today announced the close of a $2.3 million seed round. Investors include Ludlow Ventures, Initialized Capital, Paul Buchheit, Semil Shah from Haystack, Joe Montana, 500 Startups, Funders Club, Soma Capital, Altair Capital and Chloe Sladden from #Angels. Cleanly, currently operating exclusively in New York, offers an app that lets users order laundry pick-up and drop-off as quickly as thirty minutes from the time of ordering, with options to schedule further in advance, as well. The company taps large-scale laundromats to handle the actual washing, drying and folding of clothes, and contracts workers to make the pick-ups and deliveries. These Cleanly delivery people have a back-end version of the app that lets them choose which shifts they want to work, receiving an hourly rate as well as a bonus for making more stops. Cleanlys team has a background in logistics and delivery, and has built the Cleanly service in a way that collects data about parking, the type of building, the floor you live on and more so that drivers can be as efficient as possible. Cleanly founder and CEO Tom Harari said that the company is seeing 25 percent weekly growth since launching out of YC in February.
