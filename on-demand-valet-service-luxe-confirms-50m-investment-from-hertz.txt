As reported by TechCrunch in February, valet service Luxe has now confirmed that it has raised $50 million in Series B funding from car rental company Hertz. Redpoint Ventures and Venrock will also be participating in the round.Luxe also announced that Hertz Global Holdings CEO John Tague will be joining Luxes board.Our investment will support Luxes ability to scale its successful service to other major urban centers, while offering our customers enhanced convenience and value with regard to their urban parking needs, Tague said today in a canned statement. Building on an expanded Luxe footprint and capability, we will partner together to develop new innovative and integrated services that will enhance the relevancy of our core products in urban markets.Luxe pays to have valets stationed throughout major cities, ready to park a car on a moments notice, so this strategic investment will provide the on-demand company with the capital needed to run this high-cost business.Luxe says it plans to use the capital to invest in valet, operations, product and engineering teams.The company says it will also introduce new services that complement its current parking and car services.Tim Young, general partner at Eniac Ventures and investor in Luxe says that this additional capital and partnership with Hertz will pave the way to further expansion and product evolution, allowing CEO Curtis Lee and his team to fix the parking in many U.S. cities.Luxe is currently offered in six major cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Austin, Chicago and New York.Previously, Luxe raised at least $25 million in capital from Venrock, Foundation Capital, Google Ventures and others.
