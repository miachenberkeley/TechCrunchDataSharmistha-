Last year, AOL launched One, a broader platform for its variousprogrammatic ad technologies. Today its doing the same thing for its publisher tools, with the announcementof One by AOL: Publishers.The company (which owns TechCrunch and is in turn owned by Verizon) is also makinga last-minute addition to the lineup with the acquisition of AlephD, a Paris-based startup that helps publishers automaticallyidentifythe best price for each ad impression.With the big launch, AOL is takingthe individual publisher technologies that its acquired, such as Gravity and Millennial Media, and rebranding them under the One by AOL umbrella. Tim Mahlman, AOLs president of publisher platforms, said this reflects the fact that with last falls acquisition of Millennial, AOL now offers a true end-to-end stack for online publishers looking to manage their ad inventory.Mahlman joined AOL through the acquisition of Vidible.He said that until now, AOL has largely taken an approach of letting individual acquisitions run independently, but he suggested that in order for the products to become interesting at the scale AOL wanted, its time to bring them together.To be clear, publishers should still be able to buy individual pieces of the One by AOL platform, and to connect themto other products of their choosing. However, customersalso have the option of buying a single suite of products to manage their advertising needs, therefore avoiding the technology taxof using multiple partners and as a result giving away more of their revenue.2016 is the year of the publisher, where we are really going to make full court press, he added.The financial terms of the AlephD acquisition were not disclosed. The startup had raised $2 million in funding from A Plus Finance, CapDecisif and Partech Ventures, according to CrunchBase.
