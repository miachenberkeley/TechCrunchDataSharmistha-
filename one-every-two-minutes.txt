U.K. civil rights group Big Brother Watch has obtained data revealing the extent of domestic police forces access toweb users communications data.In a report published todaythe organisation saysU.K. police forces made more than 733,000 requests for comms data over a three year period (between 2012 and 2014)  which is says is the equivalent of onerequest being madeevery twominutes.On average, 96 per cent of requests wereinternally approved  so just four per cent of all requests were declined. Thereport is based on data Big Brother Watchobtained by makingFreedom of Information requests to U.K. police forces.The type of comms data police forces areaccessing typically refers to metadata such as sender and recipient details fortext messages, emails, phone calls. However Big Brother Watch says it can also includea personslocation, via theGPS on their mobile phone or IP address of their home computer; websites visited; web searches undertaken; and the method of communications used.The organization notes wider criticisms that the expansive umbrella of metadata has itself become deeply intrusive even before the new U.K. governments push to expand state surveillance capabilities,via a forthcomingInvestigatory Powers Bill that aims to sanction capturing the content of communications too, is taken into account.A key argument being made by the government to justify new legislation is a so-called capability gap for digital data capture. But Big Brother Watch says its report shows the vast majority of requests made by police forces are approved  potentially giving law enforcement access toa vast amount of information  which it arguescasts doubton Home Office claims of a lack of data being the problem.Itargues greater transparency is needed to ensure an informed debate ahead of any new state surveillance powers, noting:Currently, if the public want to know about how their communications can be accessed bylaw enforcement, their only source of information is from the transparency reportspublished by a handful of technology companies. It is unacceptable that law enforcementagencies that access and use our personal data are so lacking in transparency and are soreluctant to express the purpose and process of this element of policing.A statistical analysis of how often these powers are requested, how often they are refusedand how effective they are when used, would assist in increasing public understanding ofwhy Communications Data plays a crucial role in 21st century policing.As well as supporting calls fornew definitions of comms data, to better reflect differinglevels of intrusiveness, the organizationargues thatjudicial approval should be arequired last step in any request for comms data:Currently the system culminates with the sign-off from an internal Single Point of Contact(SPoC). Whilst law enforcement have worked hard at promoting the benefit of the internalSPoC system, based on the findings of our report and the sheer volume of communicationsdata requests approved, we believe that a further independent level of approval isnecessary to ensure that a standardised procedure exists across all police forces.This system would ensure an independent assessment of the necessity and proportionalityof the request. It would act as an extra safeguard. Should a problem occur during aninvestigation external approval will be of benefit in ensuring that independence wasmaintained whenever a request for personal data was made.Other changes it is calling for are a requirement that police forces publish transparency reports detailing how requests are approved, the number of individuals affected and the type of crime comms data is used for.It also wantsto see a clear, standardised procedure for access to comms data, and proof that data thats more than six months old is regularly used in order to establish aproportionate approach to data retention.Only one U.K. police force, Humberside, provided Big Brother Watch with a breakdown (below) of the offense categories attached to itscomms datarequests.The crimecategory generating the most requests between 2009 and 2012 for this police force was drugs. Categories generating the least requests includeauto crime, criminal damage and rape.
