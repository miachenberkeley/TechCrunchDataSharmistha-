Heya, this is the web, welcome. There is a lot of room here for activities. So much room, in fact, that you couldwrite as many words as you want and it would literally never fill up all of the space inside.* You couldwrite a 50,000 word review of an operating system. You couldwrite a zero-word commentary piece on an acquisitionor a currency. And you couldeven write something about how angry you are someone else wrote something long. Heck, you couldeven scrawlone long rambling paragraph about how policing length on the web (in either direction) is silly as heck. The web is a conduit to the world that enables a nerd fromnowhere to become the editor of TechCrunch or another to create not one but three majorpublishing platforms. Its an enabling tool, let it be that.Anyhow, the best thing for everyone is to remember that anything longer than about a tweet is only going to capture a small percentage of the mostinterestedreaders anyway and those readers are the ones youre likely writing for. So keep on keepin on.
