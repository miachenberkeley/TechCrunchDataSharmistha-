OneGo promises to give subscribers unlimited flights for a monthly fee.I first wrote about the company in June  at the time, its offerings were limited to a West Coast flights. More recently, its added plans covering the different regions of the United States, as well as a nationwide plan for $2,950 per month.Founder Paulius Grigas pitches OneGo as a way for businesses to consolidate their travel expenses and make their costs controllable and predictable. Customers will get unlimited direct flights on major airlines, as well as perks like Gogo WiFi membership and enrollment in expedited security screening program TSA Pre. (Update: OneGo says its no longer offering perks because they overlap with benefits that many frequent fliers already receive.)Under the basic plans, you must book flights at least seven days ahead of time and cant have more than four open reservations, but you can pay extra for additional flexibility.To be clear, people arent actually flying with OneGo yet, so this is basically a preview of what the companywill be offering. Its currently accepting sign-ups for its Founding Flyers and expects to putsits first subscribersin the air inNovember.OneGo is also developing an app that will allow users to make bookings from their phone.
