One board. One wheel. Zero falls.If youre wondering about my favorite thing at CES, look no further. The OneWheel is a self-balancing skateboard that uses one, big wheel to deal with obstacles, bumps, etc. with no problem at all. Oh, and if it wasnt clear already, this thing is electric and drives itself based on the way youre leaning.Weve gone into exhaustive detail on the OneWheel over the last year, which you can check out here, but given that the company has improved the aesthetic and functionality of the OneWheel, we wanted to go hands-on once again to show you what this little guy is capable of.Enjoy.
