David Low is head of developer advocacy at Skyscanner.The founder of all that we survey on the web, Tim Berners-Lee, said on this site a few years ago that, Data is the New Links.He argued that with the ever-expanding world of data-driven products, and the explosion of graphs and social media, the benefits would only be realized by a positive attitude to sharing the data in an accessible way, without expecting too much in return.Ive often been reminded of a quote from the filmThreads, which sums up the topic extremely well:In a modern society, everything connects. Each persons needs are fed by the skills of many others. Our lives are woven together in a fabric but the connections that make society strong, also make it vulnerable.Wind forward seven years from the Berners-Lee interview. We now live in an advanced Internet economy where developers are strongly encouraged to participate in the hackathon scene such as the excellentDisrupt series and adopt APIs offered by many and varied companies, bringing their 48-hour products to life.This modern Internet trend depends on the principle of linking and sharing, but further to that, large-scale API providers  either part of the Four Horsemenor aspiring to that level are now guardians of a fast-growing economy entirely dependent on safe, continued delivery.Just as the world has feared the oncoming of peak oil and tried to defend itself against the day society and machinery grind to a halt  or wars over dwindling resources we must defend ourselves against a notion of peak data, where the data powering millions of aspiring companies is so valuable it has to be kept inside walled gardens.Im reminded of a talk by Parse last year that referred back to aMark Zuckerberg F8 U-turnaboutFacebooksattitude toward rapid growth and service provision.After initially adopting the move fast and break things mantra a behaviour encouraged, and well described in a Ben Horowitz article about Programming Your Culture  it was quickly apparent that this would no longer be tolerated when the platform grew to underpin more than 500,000 developers, from fledglings to established businesses.They are now working under the banner move fast with stable infra[structure]. Whilst its not as sexy as the old method, its a sign of the times and a very positive step many would do well to follow.The Internet economy is littered with examples of bad citizenship  from APIsthat are staggeringly hard to understand to the land of mobile apps, where SDKs that ship as closed-source often mask problems that cause build problems, crashes and user instability. These are especiallydifficult to recover from in the land of the snap-judgement 1-star review.If an organization provides access to data, but closes off the means of understanding and processing that data  such as good documentation suite, self-service tools and SDKs  the value of the original access is lost.It would be understandable if there was some IP in how the data was collected or aggregated, but that shouldnt be exposed via an API or SDK anyway. Without a good understanding of what, why and how to use data, theres not going to be much faith in its supplier.Jeff Bezos once sent a memo to Amazon developers that all service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. But its something you can positively choose rather than being railroaded into doing.Companies such asStripeandLayerhave taken this principle and really worked hard to make themselves both extensible and available. They might not be amongst the Four Horsemen of the Internet just yet, but their expansion depends on adoption, so clearly they understand how to get there.Its all about getting the basics right  understandable but highly functional APIs, reusable quick-start UI components and an effective support portal. Elsewhere, app analytics provider AdJust set out with an open-source SDK  not as a reaction, but as a positive step toward trusted adoption.I wasdelighted whenParseextended its principle of stable infrastructure byopen-sourcing all its SDKs. Removing the mystery of what somethings doing inside your own product, and the added benefit of half-a-million people making the product better, proves that Sir Tims goal of sharing and trust is still possible in a fragmented age.I would encourage all data publishers to go down this road; drive adoption of their products through trust and community in the end, everyone wins.
