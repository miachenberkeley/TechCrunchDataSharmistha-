Mobile signal mapperOpenSignalhas launched a new app that maps Wi-Fi hotspots to help device usersin need of a connectivity fix  expanding its network of crowdsourced intel into another, albeit related area. (OpenSignal also launched a crowdsourced cell phone data weather-mapping app back in 2013.)The new app, called WifiMapper, launches today on iOS, with an Android app due in about a month, according to co-founder and CEO Brendan Gill.The app is free, and initially draws on a database of Wi-Fi hotspots generated by OpenSignals existing network of existing app users.Weve been crowdsourcing data on mobile network originally, and wi-fi networks, for about four years. And weve had getting towards 15 million downloads of that application, notes Gill, adding: We think weve assembled one of the biggest databases of Wi-Fi networks out there.There arealready scores of Wi-Fi hotspot mapping apps vying for attention on the App Store. But firstly its the aforementionedscale which Gill says makes OpenSignals WifiMapper stand out.Compared to most Wi-Fi apps the scale of the data weve got is really much larger, he claims.The OpenSignal app active user-base now stands at 1.5 million globally, and its those users apps which are feeding data back to this new Wi-Fi hotspot mapping app  its claiming itsdatabase contains some 500 million hotspots.The other big differentiator Gillpoints to is WifiMappers ability to distinguish between free Wi-Fi vs paid hotspots. Theres also some related context the app isshading in  so you can tell whether a free Wi-Fi hotspot is in a cafe or a bar, for instance. OpenSignal is meshing its data with Foursquares location review data to provide that added context, according toGill.Weve built intelligent algorithms to try and actually classify this Wi-Fi. Although we say weve got 500 million hotspots in our database most of those arent actually useful for users. The trick is actually figuring out which ones of those are free, he tells TechCrunch.Wevegone a lot further, and provide a lot more data to users, so weve figured out what actual place database this Wi-Fi point is attached to so you can see the actual place, the location, the name, the type of venue it is  is it a cafe, is it a bar  and also comments about the venue as well. Weve cross-referenced it with the Foursquare place database.OpenSignals Wi-Fi hotspot is also measuring the quality of the Wi-Fi  another differentiating factorinGills view.Our app has continually been tracking the speed of the Wi-Fi, the latency and other actual performance indicators. So the goal, long term, is not just to be the most definitive Wi-Fi database but find the best free, comfortable, fast, non-congested Wi-Fi hotspots out there. And I think thats something that none of the other apps are really doing, he adds.Figuring out whether a Wi-Fi hotspot is free (or not) is done viaclustering algorithms and by parsing a host of signals (no pun intended), such as the location itself  if its a bar or cafe vs an office or residential property then it might be more likely to be free, for instance. Its also taking the name of the Wi-Fi network into consideration. And OpenSignal detects whether theres a re-direct post login, which Gill notes can be an indicator of a payment gateway.And while its tried to do a lot of this automatically, post-launch it will also be engaging its users in crowdsourcing more Wi-Fi intel.The crowd can curate on top of our automatic algorithm what they think. Then we believe long term its the combination of this machine learning algorithm weve built up and then this engaged set of users tweaking the database a bit is going to give us the cleanest and best free Wi-Fi database ever, he adds.At launch, WiFiMapper users will not be pushed to using OpenSignals cellular data trackingapp  which is where its drawing its revenue from at the moment (selling anonymized network quality intel back to telcos and others). But Gill says thats something it wants to move towards long term  albeit it would likely offer WiFiMapper users the option tooptout from contributing cellulardata.I think the line will get blurred because when it comes to Wi-Fi and mobile network signal its quite similar, so we think theres going to be a good overlap there. And the kind of people that would like to curate Wi-Fi would also like to submit data about mobile network signal strength as well but ideally long term we would like to unite those communities, and to do it in a very transparent way, giving users granular control over what data they contribute, he adds.While WiFiMapper is a free download, Gill adds thatOpenSignal may look to monetize itdirectlyin future via offering in-app purchases for additional features  such as offline access to the hotspot maps, which could be useful for travelers wanting to locate connectivity without having to enable cellular roaming.Beyond that, theres a grander vision around boosting contextual app awareness which OpenSignal is working on here.Part of the vision were working towards is understanding sensory data and trying to be really intelligent with it, so actually we see the potential of this data as being  as area were really getting into is contextual awareness, and recognizing where a user is based on a wi-fi hotspot we think is interesting data, and could be used to make more intelligent applications that understand if youre in this wi-fi hotspot  if youre in a cafe or youre in a cinema  its just providing additional intelligence to what an app knows and can actually do based on that context, says Gill.We see this data as being valuable and we would like to build intelligent products using this data, he adds. If we can keep things free of ads we would like to do that.OpenSignal raised a $4 million funding round last August to expand its team and push into tracking additional areas. Gill says its not currently looking for any more funding.
