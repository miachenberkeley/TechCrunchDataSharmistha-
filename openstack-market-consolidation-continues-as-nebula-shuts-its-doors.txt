Nebula, makers of an OpenStack appliance designed to simplify the complexities of installing an OpenStack instance, shut its doors yesterday.The company announced it was shutting down with a statement that appears on its website with a date of April 1, 2015. It does not appear that this is a prank.It is with an extremely heavy heart that we announce that today, April 1, 2015, Nebula is ceasing operations.This is a difficult announcement for us to make and we want to assure our customers, shareholders, and employees that we have worked hard to explore alternatives and exhausted all potential options.The company had tons of promise, raising $38.5M in venture funds with the most recent funding being 3.5 Million debt financing on April 13, 2014. The company was co-founded by ex-NASA CTOChris Kemp, who left the company in 2013, and now sits on the OpenStack Foundation board of directors.Ken Rugg, CEO at Tesora, a database used in the OpenStack ecosystem says this announcement ispart of the ongoing trend towards consolidation in OpenStack.Metacloud and CloudScaling were both already acquired. The big fish have entered the pond making it harder for the remaining smaller OpenStack generalists to compete. Red Hat, HP, IBM, Oracle EMC and VMware are all investing huge dollars into their distributions so its hard to see how a company like Nebula can compete, Rugg explained.Rugg also believes that Nebulawas too early to market and OpenStack hadnt reached the maturity level where customers werelooking for the easier installation offered by an appliance approach in sufficient numbers. Early adopters dont mind getting their hands dirty withthe technology, but as the market matures, and the second wave of users comes along, they tend to want a simpler approach. The appliance provides a much cleaner way to get going with OpenStackI believe that delivering a software solution as an appliance works better once a market is more mature and there is already a large demand for the software and people using it. I think it tends to be a better sale to late majority who dont have the technology chops to set things up themselves and want a plug and play approach. When Netezza came out, people already knew that they needed a data warehouse and were looking to get a top of the line one in an easily consumable form factor. OpenStack is still in the early adopter phase, he explained.Mirantis CMO and co-founder BorisRenskicalled Nebulas demise unfortunate because it contributed a great deal to OpenStack, but also sawit as part of OpenStacks natural evolution where some succeedand some dont.Ultimately, however, this is a natural and unavoidable process of market maturation. OpenStack is graduating from being a cool thing for hackers to a real and mature market and as a byproduct, some of the earlier players wont make it, Renski said.PerhapsNebula paid a price for getting to the market too early. Regardless of the reason, another one bites the dust and it could be a sign for other small players that they need to figure out how to survive in a shifting marketplace.Disclosure: I used to be a paid blogger for Tesora.
