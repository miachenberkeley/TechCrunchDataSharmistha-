Opera today announced that its built-in ad blocker, which was previously only available in the experimental developer release channel, is now coming to all of its desktop users. In addition, it is now also bringing this same feature to mobile, starting with Opera Mini for Android.While ad blocking isnt exactly without controversy, there can be little doubt that it makes for a faster browsing experience  especially on mobile.Opera argues that its built-in ad blocker is also faster than using Chrome or another browser with a third-party ad-blockingadd-on. Indeed, the company argues that its solution is about 45 percent faster than using Chrome with AdBlock Plus.On mobile, Opera says Opera Mini for Android with this new feature enabled loads sites about 40 percent faster than without it (and can save quite a bit of download data, too).In addition, Opera argues that its solution also uses significantly less memory than comparable tools.On Android, Opera offers both its regular fully featured Opera browser andOpera Mini. For now, Mini which unlike its slightly more full-sized brethren featuresan always-on compression service  is the onlymobile browser in the companys lineup that offers the built-in ad blocker, but I would be surprised if the company didnt bring this tool to the non-Mini version soon, too. Opera Max, the companys system-widecompression proxy, is also a likely candidate for integrating ad blocking.All of this activity around Operas browsers comes at a time of uncertainty for Opera, given that its proposed $1.2 billion acquisition by a consortium of Chinese companies (many of which are in the advertising business) still hasnt closed. At MWC, Opera CEO Lars Boilesen told methis acquisition wasnt really his decisionandthat the company would be just fine if the deal never closed.Its hard not to look at the companys current decisions, which also include building a VPN right into its browser, without thinking that they are almost meant to provoke the companys potential acquirers (and maybe sabotage this deal).Update: Opera sent me a statement about it relationship with the Chinese consortium that is in the process of acquiring the company. Opera tells me that it is actually very positive about the acquisition and the possibility of potentially becoming part of a bigger ecosystem in a very ambitious and fast growing company. In addition, a spokesperson told me that the company is in close sync with the Chinese consortium and they are supportive of our latest product development.
