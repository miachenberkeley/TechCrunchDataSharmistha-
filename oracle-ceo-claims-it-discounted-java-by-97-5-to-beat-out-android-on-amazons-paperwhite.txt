Oracle andGoogle continue to fight it out in a retrial over $9 billion that Oracleclaims Google owes it for using its Java code in its popular Android mobile platform. And in the process, were also hearingdetails about other companies that may not have been known before. Today it was the turn of Amazon, which Oracle today said ranJava in itsKindle Paperwhite, but only after Oracle agreed to license it to Amazon at a 97.5% discount to beat out Android.The details were laid outbyOracles co-CEO Safra Catz, who gave testimony today to illustrate whatkind of competition Google had injected into the market with Android: a race to zero, it seems. The testimony predates the release of Amazons Kindle Paperwhite e-reader in 2012.Amazon had used Java to create [the Kindle] reader for many years, she said. Then they had another product called the Kindle Fire and that one they used Android. They didnt license Java at that time.The way we look at different discounts and handle them with customers comes through an approval process that comes through me. I was made aware through that process that Amazon was going to [develop] the Kindle Fire with Android.They were now considering a new product called the Paperwhite and they were considering whether to use Java for that or Android.In order to compete with [Google], we ended up giving a 97.5 percent discount for the Paperwhite. Instead of what we would have historically offered them, because our competition was free, we had to offer them a cents on the dollar price.What doesnt really get explainedhere is what role Google actively played in whatever negotiationsOracle was having with Amazon (if any); or whether we should be questioning ifCatzstestimony implies that there wasa Java stranglehold on the Kindle before the Kindle Fire tablet came along, or even if what she says is correct. But if accurate, the testimony also underscores one of the bigger issuesabout Android forrivals: its free price tag.In court, Google also didntcounter-question Catz about the details of her Amazon-related testimony.Yesterday, Catz also gave testimonyin response to the oft-repeated claim that Oracle only bought Sun (where Java was first created) in order to use it to sue Google.Not true, she said in answerto a question put by her sides lawyers: it was in order to keep Sun out of the hands of a competitor like IBM, since Oracle itself had already built a considerable part of its own business on Suns technology.Updated with (non) response from Google.
