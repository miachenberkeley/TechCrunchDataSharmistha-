After years of ridiculing the cloud,Oracle has been taking ita lot more seriously recently, and it quietlypurchased StackEngine last Friday as part of aneffort to boost its Platform as a Service offerings.StackEngine, which is based in Austin, Texashad a very brief announcement on its website linking toOracle.com. It simply stated thatthe database giant had purchased the startupand all of StackEnginesemployees willbe joining Oracle under the terms of the agreement.StackEngine was founded just last year by a couple of industry veterans. In fact, it emerged from stealth in October, 2014 with a plan to operationalize Docker, the open source container system. While Docker has been a hot commodity for the last several years, StackEnginerecognized thatit lacked an administrativelayer for IT prosto manage their containers.Althoughit was possible to create this kind of administrative oversightwith Chef or Puppet usingscripts, StackEngine was hoping toprovide a properadministrative console for Docker users that had been missing up to that point. The company had received $4.5 million overa couple of rounds of investment prior tothe purchase.On its face, this seems like a strange purchase for Oracle, but its likely part of a bigger public cloud game plan. While it has made big strides in its transition to the cloud this year, this purchase is directly related to Docker containers and could signal that Oracle wants to be a player in the container market moving forward.This purchase might have actually made sense for Docker, but Docker bought Tutum, a competing productearlier this yearindicating perhaps that other container management startups could be out of luck. Docker made a management layer choice and it was Tutum.Its worth noting that in a separate announcement, Oracle announced it was building a new cloud campus in Austin, which just happens to be where StackEngine is located. The company alsoindicated it was buying housing nearby where Oracles cloud employees could live as further indication of its commitment to the project and to draw talent to the new campus.In its most recent earnings report(.pdf) earlier this month, Oracle announced total cloud revenue was up 26 percent to $649 million. It reported Platform as a Servicerevenue of$484 million for the quarter, up 34% in U.S. dollars, according to the report. On-prem revenue was actually down 7 percent, perhaps indicatingthat growth moving forward for the database giant could bein the cloud.This move gaveStackEngine a great exit path and it givesOracle another tool in its PaaSarsenal. Perhaps with that big campus in Austin under construction, you might see Oracle making other moves in 2016 as it tries to bringin more of its talent and expand its product offerings through acquisition.
