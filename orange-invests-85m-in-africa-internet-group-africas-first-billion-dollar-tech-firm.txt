Theres more money forAfrica Internet Group (AIG), the Rocket Internet-backed company that became Africas first tech unicorn last month when it landed a$326 million investmentat a valuation of more than $1 billion.AIG today revealed that it has taken an additional 75 million (around $85 million) in additional cash from new investor mobile giant Orange. Beyond the new capital, the deal marks a strategic partnership between the two that will help AIG push and promote its many businesses  which include online sales site Jumia,Uber rival Easy Taxi, Hellofood and travel booking site Jovago  across the 12 countries in Africa where Orange and AIG sharea mutual presence.Rocket Internet CEO Oliver Samwer said in a statement that there willbesignificant synergies in the future, which suggests that AIG will tap into Oranges multiple operators in some capacity. AIG already has partnerships with mobile operators Milicom and MTN, which arealso stakeholders in the business, but its collaboration with Orange will cover countries where MTN is not present. (MTN Group Chief Digital Officer Herman Singh pointed that out with a statement, presumably added to clarify that thetelcos will not step on each others toes.)While the exact scope of the partnership may not be clear right now,Orange CEO and chairmanStphane Richard did addfurther colorand explainthat AIG and Orange have inked several important partnership agreements:This investment will enable us to significantly develop our ability to market products and services developed by Orange Middle East & Africa over the Internet.
