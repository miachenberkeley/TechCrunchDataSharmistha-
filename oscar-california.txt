Oscar, the New York-basedstartup thats trying to shake uphealth insurance, is eyeing a debuton the West Coast by next year.The company is in the process of applying to operate inCalifornia for the 2016 individual exchange.We havent been approved yet, said Josh Kushner, the companys co-founder. Butwere hopeful that we will be, because we believe we meet the bar.The company will find out over the spring orsummer if they can expand to the countrys most populous state. If they do, people who want to enrollcould do so by the fall.Oscar is trying to be a more personal and immediate healthinsurance provider, with marketing, product design and customer service practices that are more in tune withthe millennialgeneration. They do telemedicine for free and let customers speak to doctors 24 hours a day and seven days a week with a goal of10 minute wait time or less.They were the first new health insurance provider to launch in the state of New York in more than a decade. Initially, there were some bumps with poor reviews within the first few months, but Kushner saidthe company has stepped up customer service since.Every interaction we have with the customer has to be productized, he said. Every time we get feedback, we just implement it.Oscar saw about 15,000 members enroll last year,and theyve doubled that number to 30,000 in this year with one month of enrollment left to go.With typical insurance customers spending anaverage of$4,500 to 5,000 per year, thats about $150 million in annual revenue.
