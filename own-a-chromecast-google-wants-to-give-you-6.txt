The Chromecast is already a damned great little device. Pretty much the only thing* that would make it better is if Google randomly gave you free money for owning one.(*except for 5ghz WiFi support, thatd be good too.)What do you know! Thats what theyre doing today.As noted by Android Authority, Google is giving out $6 in Google Play credits to Chromecast owners. One catch: it seems to be U.S.-only as far as I can tell.The idea is that youll use the $6 to rent some ooey-gooey romance movie over Valentines weekend but youre also free to use it to beef up your Clash Of Clans village, if thats more your thing.Redeeming the offer is super straightforward:You can also do this from your laptop at this link right here.Some folks who own multiple Chromecasts report being able to redeem the offer once for each of their devices while using the mobile app.
