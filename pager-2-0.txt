Pager isnt just a doctor-on-demand service anymore.Weve mentioned the New York City-based companyas part of a broader group of startups aiming to bring doctors to patients homes, and to be clear, youll still be able use the app to set up medicalhouse calls. Now, however, thats just one part of a broader experience.In the new version of Pager, everything gets managed through an interface where you chat with Pagers on-staff nurses. Once they have a sense of what you need, they can identify the medical provider and level of service thatmakes the sense for you, whether its a remote telemedicine session with a doctor, a house call or a visit to the hospital.As part of the shift, Pager is shutting down in San Francisco, at least temporarily, so that it can focus on refining the model in New York.Walter Jin, founding partner at healthcare firm Three Fields Capital, recently joined Pager as chairman. He said the company has the potential to address the cost inefficiency that exists in the healthcare system today by doing a better job of matching patients with the appropriate level of healthcare.Jin noted that in the current system, many people go to the emergency room regardless of whats wrong with them, which is the most expensive form of care available. With Pager, nurses can help you figure out the specific level of care you need  you shouldntend up visiting an expensive specialist unless its really necessary.Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Oscar Salazar added that Pager decided to focus on chat, because that was already one of the main ways users wanted to connect with medical providers in the previous version of the app.This is probably a good time to mention that Pager is focused on urgent care. The termsounds, um, urgent (sorry), but itsused in a medical context to distinguish from real emergencies. Put another way: If you think youre having a heart attack, dont use Pager,dial 911.The standard pricing for Pager includes free chats, $25 for a tele-consultation and $200 for an in-person visit. (The servicecurrently counts as an out-of-network provider for insurance purposes.) Pager is also working with businesses to provide theservice to their employees, and it will be expanding its reach through a partnership with Envision Healthcare.Pager raised a $14 million Series A fromNew Enterprise Associates and Ashton Kutchers Sound Ventures last year.
