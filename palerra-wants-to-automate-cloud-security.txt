Palerra, a cloud security startup, announced $17M in funding today as it continues to build its cloud security automation business.The round was led by new investors August Capital with current investors Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), Wing Venture Capital and Engineering Capital also participating. Todays moneybrings the total investment to $25M.The cloud service was founded in 2013 and focuses specifically on cloud security automation, according to Palerra CEO Rohit Gupta.You may wonder why companies would need a third-party cloud security product, but Palerra doesnt just provide security for a single service, it works as data moves across services and it offersseveral layers of protection across infrastructure and software services.Specifically, it looks at breach discovery, compliance, insider threat detection and incident response.Guptasays his company partners with many cloud services to provide security where the services security layer ends.When you look at where security stops, we are extending that horizontally and adding richness to it, Gupta says.Looking at inside threat detection, a company may have triedmanually monitoring their Salesforce.com data to make sure nobody is taking sales information with them prior to leaving the company. When you automate this kind of monitoring, you put a system in place that looks for suspicious behavior and sends a warning to a security official or takes an automatic corrective action.That way, if the system identifiesbehaviors that indicate an employee might be pilfering important customer data, Palerra can put a temporary hold on a user account to allow a manager to have a conversation about it. If it turns out to be a mistake, you simply reinstatethe users account privileges.If the action seems particularly heinous, you may want to permanently revoke auserscredentials.Given that no software is infallible, customers can configure the system so that an action such asrevoking user rights forever would require the approval of a security officer.In an infrastructure examplesuch as Amazon Web Services, the system can look for issues such as an open backdoor in a virtual machine or unencrypted information. Much as with SaaS monitoring, the system can take action automatically to fix asituation, or it can send a warning to a security official inside the companyWhen companies are monitoring multipleVMs, it becomes nearly impossible to track issues across so many instances, especially when they are often changing constantly.In a large enterprise with tens or hundreds of workloads running on Amazon, a service doing security monitoring becomes something thats attractive. It can reduce risk and maintain[the customers] compliance posture, Gupta explained.Palerra is based in Santa Clara and has close to 60 employees today. Gupta says he hopes to nearly double that by the end of the year using the money he gets from todays investment.He understands that growing that quickly presents some unique challenges to a young organization. He says there are two aspects to this: strategic and financial.The first requires ensuringall new employees are well trained and on the same page about the company goals, products and directionto present a united front to customers. The second requires a plan to grow and scale in a disciplined fashionwith these goals in mind.One wayit does this is using off shore development resources, which helps keep costs down. We have the abilityto take advantage of cost benefits that off shore engineering brings us,and we continue to leverage that.Thats how we maintain financial discipline, he said.
