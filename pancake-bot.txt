 Two years after buildingaDIY LEGO Pancake Bot, which involved a ketchup bottle and a built-in griddle to sizzle dispensed batter,Miguel Valenzuela,the Norway-based U.S. maker behind the earlier homebrewproject,is back crowdfunding a smarter batter dispenser that 3D prints sketchesin pancake batter andcooks them in the order you drew the lines resulting inedible pancake art.The new batter botis currently in prototype form, with Valenzuela raising money on Kickstarter toget the machine to market. Theres no LEGO in the planned commercialdesign. Hehad moved on to an acrylic design, in any case, and has also now partnered with New York based product development companyStoreBound to  in his words bring a refined version of the product to market by mid 2015.Hes hoping to ship to backers by July.This version of the Pancake Bot will include Mac and Windows software that lets users loaddesigns into the bot, via SD card,afterretracing lines in the order they want them printed. The first lines that get laid down by the bot will spend longer on the griddle and thus come up darker in the design. The machine users a combination of compressed air and a vacuum to control the batters descent.3D printing food remains a niche and mostlynovelty area, although various makers and companies have been dabbling with robotically prepared foodstuffs  such as making machines that can spin elaborate sugar concoctions, or this German company 3D printing safer food for elderly people who are at risk of choking on the real deal.No one is going to be replacing their microwave oven with a paste extruding all-in-one 3D-printer-cooker justyet but the nutritional slurry of the future looks like it will at least be cunningly concealed within fancy-lookingshapes.Valenzuelas PancakeBot has already pushed past hisoriginal $50,000 funding target, with a month left of his campaign to run. Batter-loving Kickstarter backers can bag one for $179 at this point  which isstilla fair bit less than the planned retail price of $300.
