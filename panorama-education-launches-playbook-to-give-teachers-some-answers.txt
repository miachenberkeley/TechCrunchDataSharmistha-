After two years in operation, Panorama Education, a startup that surveys students, teachers and parents to provide feedback to schools, realized it had a problem on its hands.The Boston-based startups survey tools were working;teachers and principals were measuring student sentiment around education, safety and stress; and its analytics platform was helping thousands of schools evaluate and promotewhatstandardized testing cant quantify.Yet onceeducatorsidentified a problem, they were leftempty-handedto solve it. Your 7th grade pre-algebra class isnt engaged? Okay, well now what?So earlier this year, Panorama started building a suggestion platformcalled Playbook to provide teachers and school administrators with some answers.We spend $22 billion per year in the U.S. on personal development for teachers, and the status quo today is paying a substitute to cover the class while the teacher goes to a workshop for a day, says Panorama co-founder Aaron Feuer. Thats not a particularly effective model.Playbook, thealternative that Panorama is releasing today, operates on the premise that teacher training needs to be highly personalized, and theres nobody better to instruct teachers than their peers.Once a problem is identified, Playbookpulls in data about the teacher, the class and the school to suggest approaches that teachers in similar situations have deemed effective. It aggregates national resources, as well as district-specific resources (that it helps schools digitize, if necessary) to provide teachers with a guide of vetted techniques that they can choose from.A second-year high school English teacher in South Central Los Angeles, for instance, would benefit from a much different recommendation than an experienced, private school English teacher in Beverley Hills  even if thematerial theyre teachingisnearly identical.As teachers rate the suggested techniquesand report on their progress, Playbooks prediction engine becomes more accurateover time.Over the past seven months, abetagroup of 7,000 teachers across 300 schools hasbeen testingPlaybook.Feuer reports that the majority of these early adopters are in low-income, inner-city schools, andthat the per-school fee Panorama charges is affordable even for the poorest school districts.Its totally mind blowing how much money we spend trying to help teachers and principals get better, and they really want to get better, but its not working very well, says Feuer. Two years from now, if we can be the central place where all the good ideas live, it will be really revolutionary.
