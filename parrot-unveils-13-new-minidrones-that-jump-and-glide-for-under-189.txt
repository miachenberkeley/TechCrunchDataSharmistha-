Parrot unveiled13 newminidrones this week, all for under $189.Theterrestrial Jumping drone got a major upgrade, with LED lights for nighttime driving, an internal 4GB memory to record video, and a boost mode that brings its top speed to 8mph.The new Airborne quadcopter now hasLED lights as well, in addition to an optional LEGOattachment platformfor kids. Mike Perez, VP of Sales for Parrot, tells me that Parrot haspartnered with childrens coding platforms Tynker and Tickleso that teachers can incorporate the minidrones into their STEM curriculum.The Hydrofoil is a flying drone, attached to a hydrofoil platform, that glides across the water at up to 6mph. Admittedly, we had quite a hard time controlling this one, and spent most of ourtime running into oneside of the pool.Check out the video above to see the minidronesin action.
