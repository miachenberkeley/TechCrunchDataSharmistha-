You never know what youre going to get when you sit down with Parrot CEO Henri Seydoux. The executive is every bit as unpredictable as the company he runs  and just like Parrots products, he always puts on a good show.Seydouxs panel at Disrupt NY today was largely focused on the companys drone business. But it took some interesting zigs and zags along the way, particularly toward the end when he let the audience in on some of his more interesting plans for the future, including a rethink of one of the most ubiquitous articles of clothing out there.I am working on a T-shirt, Seydoux told the audience. Ive been working on it for two years. The executive added that he hoped to be showcasing the product at this event a few years from now.Seydoux didnt offer much in the way of specifics,most likely because of the projects relative infancy, but added confidently, Im working on a T-shirt that youve never seen before. The exec confirmed the product backstage  we mostly just wanted to make sure we were hearing things right, given Parrots previous focus on drones, audio accessoriesand, you know, things that arent T-shirts.If nothing else, the product conforms to Seydouxs vision of setting the companys sights on fun projects to engage consumers before branching out into other spacesas ithas done with its agricultural drones.You start to do things for consumers because its easy, he explained. With this you can exist. [And then] you have the possibility to divert yourself into very difficult areas.
