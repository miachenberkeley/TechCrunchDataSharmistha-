Patreon co-founder Jack Conte had a feeling thathis company might someday join forces with Subbable,which is another subscription-based funding site for artists. Thats exactly what happened today. Subabble co-founders and YouTube sensations Hank and John Green joined the Patreon family, along with 24 creators that use Subbables platform.Subbable was founded by the Green brothers in 2013, just a few monthsafterPatreon went live. Both had the same goal of funding podcasters, YouTube stars and other types of content creators.Conte and theGreen brothers have beenopen supporters of each others goals since the beginning. Hank was even on the Patreon advisory board and there had been talk about joining forces before. But talk was just that until Amazon announced its Flexible Payments Service, the payments platform Subbable used, would be shutting down at the beginning of June.This change meant Subbable would have to go through a major overhaul and ask each one of their contributors to run throughthe payments process on the site all over again. Subabble worried thataskwould meanlosing a lot of subscribers.While those subscribers, viewers and attendees wont necessarily translateinto paying customers for Patreon, Conte said he believes the Green brothers add an intrinsic value to his company.I also have a huge creator crush on the Vlogbrothers, so I couldnt be happier today, Conte added.John will join his brother Hank on the Patreon board of advisors and Patreon will on-board the brothers two most popular shows, SciShow and CrashCourse onto the Patreon platform.The amount of the acquisition was not shared. However, Conte did say that the bulk of acquisition money will go into a 40 day matching program for the Subabble creators. This means that Patreon will match the contributions of any of the old Subabble subscriberswhopledge to the Subbable creators that are now on Patreon, up to $100,000.
