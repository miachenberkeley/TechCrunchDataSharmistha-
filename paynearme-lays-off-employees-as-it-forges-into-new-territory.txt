PayNearMe is a financial services startup thathasmanaged to fly under the radar of the tech-savvy. Thats largely because the six-year-old company is focused on the roughly 25 percent of people in the U.S. who dont have bank accounts to pay for things like rent and utilities and online purchases. In fact, its customers largely interface with PayNearMes brand when theyre at a 7-Eleven or Family Dollar or Ace Cash Express store, all of which have partnered with PayNearMe to transform customers cash into payments.Its a big market, but its also highly challenging and fragmented, and the road, apparently, has been bumpy.For one thing, Family Dollar stores, which first partnered with PayNearMe in early 2014, recently stopped accepting rent payments in its roughly 8,000 stores across the U.S.A landlord source says the decision was made out of safety concerns overcustomers who were walking in with large piles of cash. (Family Dollar did not respond to a recent request for comment about what drove its decision.)Given that PayNearMe sees a cut from every transaction and that rental payments is howit produces much of its revenue, the decision has to sting.PayNearMealso failed to secure a major new round of funding, says an outsider who is close to the company andwhosays that earlier this year, employees were told that PayNearMe was looking to raise between $50 million and $80 million in newfunding before later settlingfor a $14 million round from earlier investors. (PayNearMe has so far raised $71 million altogether, including from True Ventures, Khosla Ventures, and August Capital.)In fact, according to this source,PayNearMe abruptly laid off roughly one-third of its employees several weeks ago, forced by investors to scale back on costlyefforts to cultivate relationships with third partiesand to focus more instead on its business-to-consumer efforts. The cuts apparently came insales, marketing and business development.Founder and CEO Danny Shader declined to comment for this story except to say that he has never been more bullish about PayNearMesprospects and that his investors are super enthusiastic about its future, as well.Asource inside the company adds that our external sources claims about layoffs and fundings are simply not true. While there werelayoffs,they represented far less than a third of the now 50-person company, says this person, who declined to answerhow many people were let go.Thesource inside the company also says PayNearMe was not in the market for a new round of funding  that instead its embarking on some new initiatives that could meaningfully enhance thevaluation of the company. PayNearMe is waiting on those to take hold before talking again with investors, according to this person.Certainly, PayNearMe appears to havesomethings up its sleeve. Shader hinted at themseveral weeks ago in an interviewwith this reporter for StrictlyVC. Said Shader at the time, I can say that we now have a complete set of money transmitting licenses in the U.S. and Puerto Rico that we spent the last three years and millions of dollars [to obtain]. The licenses allow us to act as an agent of a consumer, taking their money and delivering it to some other location. It lets us enter adjacent markets. [But thats all I can say.]Put another way, in the not-too-distant future,PayNearMe might not beneeding so many third-party relationships after all.Still, one suspects that for Shader  a well-liked Silicon Valley veteran who has variously been the CEO of Good Technology, an EIR at both Benchmark and Kleiner Perkins, and who co-founded a company that sold to Amazon in 1999  not all has gone exactly as planned of late.For example, we were told of one employee who recentlymoved across the country to work at PayNearMe. In an account that our internal source confirms, the employee was laid off along with everyone else who was cutin thefirms recent, broader restructuring. It was his third day there.Update: After this articles publication, Shader reached out to us to say that, We actually grow more in one month than the revenue hit from Family Dollar due to rent . . .weabsolutely will be expanding our retail relationships, not shrinking them, and noRIFd employee ever moved across the country  or even across a state  to work for us.
