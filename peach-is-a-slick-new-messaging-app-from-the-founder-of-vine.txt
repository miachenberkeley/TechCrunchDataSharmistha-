Chat chat chat, talk talk talk. We love it, you love it. Messaging apps are hot for 2016 (again) and theres seemingly a niche platform for all of us. There are also big platforms for the rest of the world like Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, Snapchat and Hangouts (and tons more).One new app, Peach, is pretty interesting. Peach was created by the founder of Vine, Dom Hofmann. Whats different about it, though? Well, the onboarding is pretty slick and the engagement experience is kind of like using Slack commands, if youre familiar with that. The onboarding also feels a lot like Slackbot, too.We just signed up to  and their on-boarding is magical  https://t.co/wzPeljRLcN

Peach calls them magic words.Others:* Use the magic word shout to write a few words (+ emoji) in BIG letters on a background color.
* Use draw to post a doodle or sketch.
* Use song to share whatevers playing right now. Friends can tap on the song to open it in Apple Music or Spotify.
* The magic word rate lets you give anythinganything! a 1-5 star rating.
* Other magic words: gif, here, goodmorning, goodnight, battery, weather, move, meetings, safari, dice, time, date, movie, tv, and game. With more on the way.You can also be prompted with interesting questions to answer if youre not sure of what to post. All of it goes to your home, which serves as a Facebook Wall of sorts where people can like your stuff and comment on it. No direct messaging here, all out in the open like Twitter. So yeah, messaging, communications, social network, AIM status messages, etc.Naturally, theres even a wave feature thats like a Facebook Poke (or Cake or other actions). It sends a push notification (yes, like Yo) and fun is had.Its also cool to watch your friends update their status in realtime from one screen:Is there room for YAMA (Yet Another Messaging App)? I say yes, especially when people like Hofmanns Byte team is thinking outside of the box. One thing to note, it looks like its just for iOS now. However, its definitely catching fire quickly. In fact, Ive seen something similar to it before, but thats a story for another time.Peach reminds me of Twitter in the early days (share "what's happening").
