We wanted to make the experience as delightful and safe for the broadcaster as possible, and one way to do that was to make the content more ephemeral. Weve moved past that world in a short amount of time and our community has told us they want the option to save their broadcasts. Were doing it in a way that feels very true to Periscope, and puts the control in the hands of the broadcaster.This is a bigstep towards a truly livesocial network, where everything seen through phones on the ground, or the drones in the air, can be shared with an audience who mightinteract.
