Its been increasinglyevidentfor years: smartphone users are diggingbigger phones as they do more on screens, and spend less time talking on the phone. And theres no sign of theappetite for super-sizing mobile handsetsabating  not according to a new report from Yahoo-owned mobile analytics firm Flurry.The firm has looked at a top slice of data taken from the1.6 billion devices it tracks every month  focusing on the top 875 devices it says accounted for 87 percent of sessions in March 2015 to exploreglobal active device usage by screen size. Flurryfound that phablets have more than tripled their share of usage since last year.In January 2014, Flurry recordedjust 6 percent of active users were on phablets versus 68 percent usingmedium phones (devices with a screen size between 3.5 inches and 4.9 inches). But by March this yearphablet usage had swelled to a fifth (20 percent), with medium phones squeezed downto 59 percent.Full-sized tablets are alsobeingcannibalized  or capped  by phablets, with a shrinking overall share of active users:Apples first phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus, went on sale last fall  finally affordingiOS users who wantto remain on Apples platform the option of using an i-Phablet. That pent up demand hasevidently contributed to driving phablet usage.That said, Android remains the dominantforce in phablets  which is not surprising,given how many more large-screened Android smartphones there are to choose from versus just the one iPhone. Flurry found that around one-third (36 percent) of Android users areusing phablets versus just 4 percent of iOS users. So iOS developers are still mostly going to be focused on building smaller phone experiences  and on iPad apps (full-sized tablet usage accounts for a fifth of iOS usage).By contrast,Android usage on full size tablets is very weak (just 3percent)  underlining what we knew already: that Android tablets have flopped, but also thatthere hasbeen less impetus and demand for full-sized Android slatesbecause Android phones have had larger screens for longer.Flurry hasalso charted the growth in Android device makers offering phablets  noting that Android phablets only made up 10 percent of overall Android phones back in 2013. But, two years on, phablets account for close to a third (27 percent) of all Android devices. So really the Android phablet is the Android tablet.
