Last night a single tweet on everyones favoritenews platformwasheard round the world. No, Im not talking about the tweet that cost an NFL draft prospect $14 million dollars. Or Drakes tweet dropping his new album, Views.Im talking about Apple marketing boss Phil Schiller taking to Twitter to finally answerthe age-old question of how to correctly refer to multiple iPhones, eriPhone devices.Itall started when Benedict Evans posted a podcast with acaption referring to iPads Pro, pluralizing the device like one would pluralize Attorneys General. After a brief back and forth, someone summoned Schiller to end the debate once and for all.@Gartenberg @BenedictEvans @stevesi @macintux One need never pluralize Apple product names. Ex: Mr. Evans used two iPad Pro devices. Philip Schiller (@pschiller) April 28, 2016Hmm. So according to Schiller (and by association, Apple), its wrong to say something like I have two iPhones. Instead, we should say I have two iPhone, or I have two iPhone devices.@parks @Gartenberg @BenedictEvans @stevesi @reneritchie 2. It would be proper to say "I have 3 Macintosh" or "I have 3 Macintosh computers" Philip Schiller (@pschiller) April 29, 2016But this sounds so awkward! Unfortunately,like most things Apple, the company seems to be set in their ways, andwill always say something like iPhone devices in their press releases.In all seriousness though, its great to seeSchiller interacting with Apple fans and developers via his Twitter. Not only is it a useful source of information, but shows customers a more personal side of Apples executives that is usually reserved only for keynotes.
