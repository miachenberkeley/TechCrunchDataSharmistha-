Piazza, a Palo Alto, Ca.-based class discussion platform, has more than 30,000 educators, 1 million students and 1,200 universities in 70 countries using its platform.Thats not too shabby for a six-year-old company. But Piazza is now rolling out a new tool that it hopes will supercharge greater adoption with recruiters, too, and generatemore revenue in the process.Called the Reverse Engineer Your Top Hire tool, the idea is for recruiting and hiring managers (who Piazza began courting in early 2014) to input the names of their most successful collegiate hires and, based on those former students backgrounds, find current students who could be similarly successful in their careers.The information is all at Piazzas fingertips, says company COO Jessica Gilmartin, who says that Piazza knows a whole lot about the technical students using its platform, including where they go to school, what classes they take, who their professors are, and what types of questions theyaskon the platform.Students can opt out of the companys recruiting product. But those whoare interested in career opportunitiescan be targeted by recruiters on more granular level than ever, Gilmartin says.Piazzasnew tool, for example, can showwho has been a teaching assistant a strong signal to recruiters that someone knows their stuff.It can also turn up who has won hackathons, who has taken more security courses (a strong area of interest for many employers), and who has focused more on Java versus other application frameworks like AngularJS or Node.js. (Big companies are more interested in the former, says Gilmartin,while startups tend to look for recruits whove spent more time learning the latter.)Piazzas new tool isnt its first attempt to raise its profile with companies, 350 of which now pay the company between $2,000 and six figures annually depending on their size and needs.Earlier this year, for example, Piazza also began surveying its student users about where theyd want to work, feedback that it breaks down for recruitersin a variety of ways.Asked if the company could possibly be gearing up to raise its next funding round  Piazza has raised $15.5 million from investors to date, including Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Felicis Ventures, and Sequoia Capital  Gilmartin acknowledges that a Series C round probably isnt far off. Piazza,which sealed up its last round 18 months ago, will likely turn to investors again next year, she tells us.In the meantime, the25-person companyisjust focused on growing the business, she adds.
