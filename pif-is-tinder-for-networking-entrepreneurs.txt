Launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, PIF(Pay It Forward) isan appthat is taking a literal approachto social networking.Essentially a Tinder for networking, the app is designed to introduce people from within a specific industry (starting with the start-up community) who may not have otherwise had a chance to meet.Each user has a profile with a photo and brief description of themselves. Users can then view other users profiles, and decide whether or not they want to be matched up, a la Tinder. This aspect of the apps matching algorithmis pretty straightforward: Once two people swipe right on each others profile, they are automatically placed into a conversation.However, what makes the app interesting is a second algorithm which allows users to be placed in a private chat with someone they wish to meet, without a mutual request from the other person.While this sounds potentially intrusive, the algorithm is based on a pay it forward system, where users are allowed to start oneunsolicited chat with someone in the startup community for every unsolicited chat request they accept.While highly valuable to someone trying to gain contacts inside an industry, its not as clear what the benefit of PIF would be to someone already well connected in an industry.This is a similar problem faced by LinkedIn: There are a small number of influencer that a large number of people want to connect with.However, the companys point of view is that all of ushave other people whom we want (or will want) to connect with, but currently we dont even know they exist.This perspective makes sense, especially in the startup world where talent discovery and deal flow are major parts of an investors workflow.IfPIF canhelp a high-profile VC make an investment in a disruptive startup they wouldnt have otherwise come across,it would quickly showentrepreneurs, investors, and other players in the startup ecosystem the benefits of unsolicited connections.PIF is available now and can be downloaded from the iOS App Store or Google Play.
