Pitching your startup, with all its nuance and potential, can be a difficult task. So, as lovers of the new new entrepreneur, John and I have decided to make it more difficult. Enter, the TC Radio Pitch-Off. Each week, John and I go live from the Sirius XM Studios on Insight 121 to discuss the latest in tech news. And then we head straight into our TC Radio Pitch-Off, where five pre-selected companies have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product live on the radio to a panel of judges. Just like Disrupt Battlefield or the TC Pitch-Off + Meetups, judges hold a quick Q&A and deliberate live on the air to determine a winner. But in order to be in the TC Radio Pitch-Off, you must first apply. If this sounds like your jam, follow the instructions below:Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!
