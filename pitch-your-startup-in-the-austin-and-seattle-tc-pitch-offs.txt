Hot on the heels of Disrupt, were (re)packing our bags to come to two of our favorite cities in the world, Austin and Seattle.Well be hitting Austin on June 23, where well get a little weird, and then well head up to Seattle on June 25 for our third-annual Seattle Pitch-Off. These will be nights to remember, but prep starts now.The first priority is going through applications for the Pitch-Offs, which offer ten startups from each city the opportunity to hop on stage and pitch their product to the audience and a panel of local VC judges.They have just sixty seconds to make their presentation, followed by a short Q&A, and the winner goes home with two tickets to TechCrunch Disrupt SF and a table at Startup Alley.If any of that is enticing to you, head over here to fill out an application.If not, thats okay! We have lots in store for everyone, whether youre simply too early- or late-stage to participate in the pitch-off or you just want to hang with cool people in tech scene. Tickets costs $10 and include a drink ticket (which means this is a 21+ event).Buy tickets to Austin here. Buy tickets to Seattle here.We hope to see you there!Our sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
