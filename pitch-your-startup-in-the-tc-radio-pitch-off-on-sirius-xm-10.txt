Im often told I have a face for radio, which works out well given that TechCrunch has its own radio show on Sirius XM each week.On Tuesdays, John Biggs and I head to midtown to host TechCrunch Radio on Sirius XM Insight 121, which includes the patented TC Radio Pitch-Off. Five companies get exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to a panel of judges, followed by a short Q&A.For any early-stage startup, its an excellent opportunity to get feedback on your product and build awareness.Sound like something youre into?Follow the instructions below to apply to be in the pitch-off.Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
