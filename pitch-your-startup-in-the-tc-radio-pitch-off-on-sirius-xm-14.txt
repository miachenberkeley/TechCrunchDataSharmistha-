Happy Thursday, dear readers. Once again I come to you with news about TechCrunch Radio, our weekly radio show on Sirius XM where John Biggs and I discuss everything new in the world of tech. But thats not all!Each week on the show, we hold a TC Radio Pitch-off, where five companies get exactly 60 seconds to pitch their startup to a panel of judges, including a guest VC. After a brief Q&A with each company, judges deliberate live on the air to choose a winner. Its always a great time, and we hope you listen/call in on Tuesdays at 6pm ET on Sirius XM 121 Insight. If youd like to participate in the TC Radio Pitch-off, follow application instructions below. Rules:
