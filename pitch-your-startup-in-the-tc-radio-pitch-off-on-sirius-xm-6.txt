The best part of every TechCrunch Radio show (and trust me, there are tons of good parts) is the TC Radio Pitch-Off. For the last half-hour of each show, John Biggs and I bring on five of the coolest new startups we can find to pitch their product live on the radio. They each have exactly sixty seconds to share their story, at which point theyll answer a few questions from a panel of judges, usually including a cool VC. After all the pitches, we deliberate on a winner live on the radio. Its always great fun, but in order to make it happen, we need cool startups to apply. Sound like you? If so, follow instructions below. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Sirius XM Insight 121, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
