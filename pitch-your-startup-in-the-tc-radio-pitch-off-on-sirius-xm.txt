There are a few ways to get a chance to pitch your startup to TC editors, investors, and a breath-caught audience all at the same time.You could apply to be in the Startup Battlefield at the world-famous TC Disrupt conference, held three times a year. You could apply to be in one of our regional TC pitch-offs (check out our upcoming Pitch-Offs in Atlanta and Boston on February 24 and February 26 respectively).Or you could apply to be featured in the TC Radio pitch-off, which goes down once a week, every week, without fail. Plus, startups participating in the TC Radio Pitch-off only have to call in, rather than fly into a specific city and haul your busy body to an event.Seems kind of like a no-brainer, right?The TC Radio Pitch-Off goes down on every episode of TechCrunch Radio on Sirius XM. Startups have 60 seconds to present their wares with a two-minute followup Q&A from the judges.Its always a great time, and we hope to chat with you on the show.Here are the deets:Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
