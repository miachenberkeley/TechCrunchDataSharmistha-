Though some adults still feel awkward about having conversations with their smartphones mobile assistant, like Siri, kids today seem to have no qualms aboutchattering withourvirtual helpers. My daughter, for example, thinks of Siri as just another one of iPads toys. She also regularly instructsme to ask Google for the answer, and hits up our smart speaker Amazon Echo for new jokes,courtesy ofits assistant Alexa.San Francisco-based kids entertainment startupToyTalk, founded by former Pixar execs, has been tapping into this trend ofkids having conversations with virtual entities through a suite of mobile apps featuring animated characters they can talk to. Now the company is debuting the first product to result from its partnership with toy company Mattel, with an app that lets kids chat with one of Mattels better-known characters,Thomas the Tank Engine.The iOS app, which arrives in time forThomas the Tank Engines 70th anniversary, allows children to have two-way conversations with both him and his friends,Percy, Emily, James, Gordon, Toby and Sir Topham Hatt, on eight journeys through the Island of Sodor.The first story in the app is free, then each of the five additional episodes are available as in-app purchases of $0.99 apiece or $3.99 for the bundle. There are also two bonus episodes that are unlocked after kids complete the first six, bringing the total to eight.In the stories, kids are presented with activities that encourage conversations, while also learning shapes, playing memory games, singing, telling stories, solving mysteries, making silly noises and more.The Thomas & Friends Talk To You app works similarly to those ToyTalk has already produced, which so far have served to be more representative of what the companys technology is capable of, rather than becoming a large kids entertainment business in and of themselves. Those apps, like SpeakaZoo, The Winston Show andSpeakaLegend, for example, are not household names, but offerclever stories where kids talk to fantastical characters who both initiate conversations and respond to questions.To make this possible, ToyTalk has developed interesting conversational technology thatsspecifically designed foruse with littler kids. This is no small feat.The company was founded byformer Pixar CTO Oren Jacob, who worked on films like Toy Story (1 & 2), A Bugs Life, and Finding Nemo, along withMartin Reddy, previously of Siris birthplace, SRI as well as Pixar. In order for the characters to respond, ToyTalksappshave to use a combination of speech recognition technology, natural language processing, and a little AI to make things work.This can be challenging, as childrens voices are more difficult to understand than adults. Not to mention, they tend to go off-script and say some pretty crazy things. To be fair, Ive seen ToyTalks apps stumble when my kid threw them for a loop with unexpected responses. They are programmed to understand positive and negative answers, and then replyaccordingly, but they dont know quite what to do when the kid veers off in an unforeseen directionas kids do.That being said, my childstill regularly played with the apps and was very forgiving of their mistakes. After all, they were much more fun than Siri, as it turned out.However, because of consumers heightened fears over technologys invasiveness, ToyTalk recently faced apetitionfroma consumer protection agencywho misunderstood the fine line between voice recognition and eavesdropping. A group called the Coalition for a Commercial Free Childhood askedtoymaker Mattel to halt production on its upcoming doll, Hello Barbie, that will be powered by ToyTalk technology.Itsnot surprising that consumers would assume the worst of ToyTalk  weve already had our social media networks compromised, our data sold, our accounts hacked. Weve been spied on by our own government, and now even our smart TVs are listening to our private conversations. Plus, ToyTalks privacy policy wording at the time seemed to violate COPPA (the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act), as it implied that the voice recordings would be filed and used for advertising purposes.The company responded that its apps were not eavesdropping  in fact, kids had to push a button, as if on a walkie-talkie, to engage inthe conversations. And it said the data it collected was not being used for advertising or marketing, but rather R&D purposes.Today, with the release of itsThomas & Friends Talk To You app, the company states that it is COPPA-compliant and kidSAFE-certified in order to further downplay those fears.The new app is actually the first of several products that will be put out jointly by Mattel and ToyTalk, including the forthcoming Hello Barbie which is still due to arrive in a couple of weeks.The app will be live on iTunes today and will launch on Android at a later point.ToyTalk is backed by $31.2 million in outside funding, according to CrunchBase, following its $15 million Series C led by Khosla Ventures in December.
