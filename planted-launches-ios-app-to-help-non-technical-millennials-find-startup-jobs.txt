For thosewho just graduated college with a computer science degree, landing ajob at a startup shouldnt be too difficult. For non-technical graduates, however, its not so simple nearly half of all recent college grads are underemployed.Planted, formerly known as Lynxsy, is launching its iOS app today to help non-technical Millennials find jobs with startups. Itpairs a data-driven algorithm with a layer of human curation to ensure that candidates are matched with the right job prospects.We monitor over 100 different data signals from both the employer and the candidate, ranging from background, to preferences, to which positions people opt into on the platform, says Connie Wong, co-founder of Planted.According to a recent survey by Glassdoor, 45% of job seekers are using their smartphoneon a daily basis to look for jobs. Planted reports over 50% of engagement on mobile, even prior to the launch of its mobileapp.We see mobile as an opportunity to take the work out of finding work, and to transform the overwhelming black hole that is the job board experience, says Susan Zheng, Wongsco-founder.By providing users with a personalized batch of three to five job prospects each day, Planted hopes to make the job hunt feel less overwhelming.Wong and Zhenggraduated from Techstars in June of last year, and theyve since brought12,000 job seekers and 400 companies (including SeatGeek, ClassPass, and Constant Contact) ontothe Planted platform.Theyre currently focused on New York, where nearly 60% of all startup jobs are non-technical roles. In less than a year afterlaunching, Planted hashelped over 200 candidates land jobs.
