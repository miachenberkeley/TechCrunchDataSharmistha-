Meal-kitdelivery startup PlateJoy has raised $1.7 million in seed money to get into bigger markets and takeon competitors like Blue Apron in the recipes-for-delivery segment.The funding comes from Foundation Capital, Sherpa Ventures, HealthBox, 500 Startups, VaynerRSE, Bassett Investments, Gotham Gal Ventures Joanne Wilson and celebrity investor Jared Leto.Saying there is a lot of competition in the meal-delivery space is an understatement. There are at least 12 food-delivery services in San Francisco, and it seems likeanother one pops up in some U.S. city every day. Add that to some of the bigger players in the make-a-meal-at-home-with-delivered-ingredients space like Blue Apron and Plated and it seems like this would be a tough space for PlateJoy to conquer.Blue Apron alone delivers over 2 million meals a month now, according to the company. It also has $58 million in the bank with a $60 million revenue run rate per year, dwarfing PlateJoy, which started just a year afterBlue Apron.Itsmostly irrelevant, he told TechCrunch over the phone. There are a lot of food startups but peopleeat fourto five times a day. And if you ask most CEOs, they are not eating healthy enough. They just arent.The healthy meal aspect is what prompted founderChristina Bognet to create PlateJoy shortly after graduating from MIT and dropping 50 pounds.I tried every diet delivery service under the sun and couldnt believe how bad they all were and yet they were so expensive, shesaid.Bognet started eating healthy and taught herself how to cook healthy meals at home.I was going to be a doctor but I thought I could do something like this for others, she explained. PlateJoy intends to get at the meal-delivery market and take on some of the bigger players like Blue Apron by providing a healthier option of food that people can make at home.The majority of the funding will go towards expanding PlateJoyspersonalization process, which is atool usedto customize mealsaccording toyour weight loss and lifestyle goals. Customers input theircurrent weight,height, whether they are vegan, vegetarian and how much theywant to lose in order to create custom meals and portion sizes for theirneeds. A queue of meals are then generated, according to their specifictastes and needs.PlateJoy will also be hiring a slew of developers, marketers and designers in order to further customize the site to the needs of customers.When you ask people whether or not theyre happy with the way theyre eating, almosteveryone says no.
