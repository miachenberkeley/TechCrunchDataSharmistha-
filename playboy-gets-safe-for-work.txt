Playboy looked both backwards and forwards duringits first NewFrontstoday,where it pitched advertisers on its plans for what CEO Scott Flanders described as the new, multi-platform Playboy.Now, when I say Playboy event, youve probably got some preconceived ideas about whats involved. Turns out, however, that it wasnt all that different from plenty of other corporate digital media presentations, with lots of talk about branded content, millennials and brand ambassadors.Which makes sense, since Playboy took nudes off its website in 2014, andthe print magazine recently followed suit. (To be clear, it still includes picturesof attractive women, butnow those pictures are a bit more safe for work.)According to the Playboy executives who spoke onstage, the change hashelped the website grow by 400 percent and also lowered the average age of the reader from 47 to 31 years old.In some ways, it seems like Playboy wants to be the next Vice  programs discussed atNewFronts included lots of documentaries and lifestyle programming aimed at the aforementioned millennials. For example, theres Journalista, a documentary series from Yoonj Kim, and House of Waris, a dinner-and-discussion show hosted by Waris Ahluwalia with guests like actress Natasha Lyonne and Sonic Youths Kim Gordon.The company also announced that its forming a divisioncalled Playboy Studios, which will focuson creating marketing content for brands. (It seems likeevery media company needs its own content studio these days.)But without the nude centerfolds for whichthe magazine was best known, what sets Playboy apart in 2016?Ahluwalia said Playboy aims to be a wingman of sorts, helping men navigateliving the good life. He also said that the publication isdefined by three broad principles  progress, freedom and exploration.And the speakers consistently emphasizedthe idea that Playboy has had moreto offer than sex appeal. After all, the magazine has published high-profile authors and interviewed noteworthy public figuresthroughout its history.Sex wasnt completely absent from thepresentations  sometimes it was mentioned playfully, like when Ahluwalia described branded content asthe proverbial aphrodisiac of marketing. And sometimes it was moresubstantial, likein the upcomingSex and Relationships Index that aims to reboot Alfred Kinseys work and paint an updated picture of how millennials look at these issues.And for all the challenges that Playboy faces in reinventing itself, Head of Branded Content Hugh Garvey noted that the publication still has 97 percent unaided global brand awareness  in other words, 97 percent of the global population knows what Playboy is.We wrote the story ofthe good life once, and now were doing it again, he said.
