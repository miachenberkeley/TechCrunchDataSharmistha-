Sony is showing off a live four-player local multiplayer mode for its Morpheus virtual reality headset for PlayStation 4 at E3 2015 this year. This marks the first time the company has hadthis kind of multiplayer experience ready for people to actually try out with a real game,including a new game called Rigs for 3v3 multiplayer arena battles.Virtual reality is coming much closer to becoming a real thing available to consumers this year, but shared experiences in a VR environment are still fairly rare. If Sony can provide a compelling sense of shared VR, without any awkwardness in terms of how players work together in tight quarters, it could have a considerable lead on other offerings.An arena battler is a good multiplayer starting point,but well hopefully hear more about how well this works later on this week after players have had a chance to give it a try.
