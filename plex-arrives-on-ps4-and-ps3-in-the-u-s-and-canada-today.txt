Plex is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 today. The personal media hub software originally came to Sonys consoles back in mid-December of 2014, with a U.S. launch promised for a later date. While the release date is different, the software is the same offering a horizontal browsing experience designed to surface content from your library that you should find especially interesting.Plex on PlayStation gives you access to all the TVs and movies you have stored on your primary Plex server, and allows you to pick up where you left off on other platforms, as well as see your On Deck queue and of course have a look at ratings, summaries, cast information and more for all your stored media. The one limitation is that at launch, Plex on PlayStation consoles is available only to Plex Pass subscribers, with a rollout to non-paying Plex users planned for later (with a one-time purchase price for the app itself).Sonys PlayStation 4 console focused a lot less on media center functions when compared to the Xbox One at launch, and in fact the Xbone (and the Xbox 360) did get Plex before Sonys game systems. But the arrival of Plex on PS4 actually goes a long way to making it a more comprehensive destination for those hoping to trim down the number of devices plugged into their TVs at any one time.Plex and Sony say the app will be available in the PlayStation Store starting this afternoon Pacific Time, so keep your downloading finger at the ready.
