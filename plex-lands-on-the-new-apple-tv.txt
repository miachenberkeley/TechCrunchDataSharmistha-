Plex, the much adored app for streaming totally-legit-and-not-at-all-bootlegged-cough-cough content from your PC to your other gadgets, has just hit the new Apple TV.Wondering what the heck Plex is? The short answer: you run a Plex server on your PC, and load it up with video and music files in just about any format  from your standard DiVX/XVid file to a big ol high res MKV. Bring up a Plex client on your phone, Chromecast, or now your AppleTV, tap the video you want to play, and bam  it streams it from your PC to your device, transcoding it into a device-friendly format on the fly.But wait! you say. My friend had an old Apple TV, and it was running Plex!Thats possible! Plex was available on Apple TV before today  you just had to hack the heck out of the Apple TV to make it work. And it wasnt official Plex, but a third party rebuild (and, its worth noting, both of the main developers on that build now work for Plex).Today, however, Plex on AppleTV goes legit, and its free to download. You can find the universal iOS/Apple TV Plex app right over here.
