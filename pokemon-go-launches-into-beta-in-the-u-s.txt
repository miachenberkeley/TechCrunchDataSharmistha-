Niantic Labs, the game maker thatwas spun out of Googlelast year following Googles move to Alphabet, announced today that its new titlePokmon GO is launching into beta in the U.S. Those early adopters who signed up to become field testers earlier in May are now receiving their invites to the game, in order to offer the company feedback ahead of its broader launch.The expanded field tests follow those that are already underway inJapan, Australia and New Zealand, but the expansion to the U.S. hints that the game is nearing its public debut.News that Niantic was working on this project was unveiledin 2015, alongside its$20 million round of Series A funding fromPokmon Company Group, Google and Nintendo. Because Niantic wasnt spun out of Google to become its own company under the Alphabet umbrella, it has the advantage of operating more like a startup rather than relying on a parent companys support. As NianticsCEO John Hanke previously told TechCrunch, being independent means it can be more nimble and can work with companies and teams in new ways.But that also means the companywill need to successfully launch this highly anticipated Pokmon titleon mobile, as well as attract and retain an engaged audience of players. Ideally, that audience will include those who are new to thePokmon universe, too.On a company blog post today, Niantic also revealed a bit more about the game itself. Like Niantics previous title Ingress, which connected gameplay to the real world,Pokmon GO will involve real-world locations.Trainers can helpPokmon evolve, and find and collectPokmon Eggs, in addition to fully grownPokmon. But youll have to walk a preset distance to hatch the Egg in order to see whichPokmon emerges, the post explains.In addition, Trainers will encounterPokmon Gyms in real-world locations, where they can test theirPokmon in battles, and compete to control the Gym for one of threePokmon Trainer teams. Users will join these teamsto battle others teams in these various Gyms, located around the world, with the goal of gaining control of the Gym.The idea that the mobile world and the real world are connected via the phone and its various sensors is one of Niantics hallmarks, and using an iconic title likePokmon should attract a larger audience to experiment with this crossover form of gaming, as compared with Ingress.There will bemore than100Pokmon to capture in the wild  and youll be alerted when one is near thanks to push notifications sent to your phone. Other details about gameplay were previously announced  like how to usePok Ball to catch yourPokmon, plus the games use ofPokStops located at places like public art installations, historical markers and monuments, where you can collect more Pok Balls and other items.If you missed the call for beta testers before, it appears that the form is still acceptingsign-uprequests. However, its unclear how many total testers will be let in. The game is expected to launch on both iOS and Android devices later this year.
