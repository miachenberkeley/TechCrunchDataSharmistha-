Okay, the bike thing probably isnt true but Postmates co-founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann will join us on stage at TC Disrupt New York in May.Almost four years ago, Lehmann stepped onto the TechCrunch Disrupt stage and launched a company called Postmates, with a plan to totally disrupt the courier industry.Then, the companys original focus was on delivering packages from one person to another, with an app to help facilitate the general courier workflow, but the company also said that brick-and-mortar retailers could sign on through a Postmates API.Postmates has come a long way since that day in 2011.By May of 2012, Postmates had debuted a Get It Now button in San Francisco, letting users order anything they want in the city for a small delivery fee on top of the price of the product.Since then, the company has spent its time focusing on deeper integrations with retailers and expansion into new markets.By May 2013 Postmates was headed into New York city, after tackling San Francisco and Seattle, and over the next year doubled that expansion into three more cities.Today, the company operates in more than 64 markets, and has received over $58 million in funding across six rounds, according to Crunchbase. The explosive growth over the last year has left us more curious than ever.Its about time we get Lehmann back on the Disrupt stage.Bastian Lehmann will join other notable Disrupt NY speakers, includingSean Rad, Aaron Levie and Ron Conway.The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center. Tickets are available at an early-bird discount rate until April 11.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
