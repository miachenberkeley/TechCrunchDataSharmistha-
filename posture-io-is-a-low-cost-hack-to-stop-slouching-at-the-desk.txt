If you saw someone pushing an office chair through New Yorks financial district this weekend chances are it was this guy: developer Joe Heenan, whos just shown off a neat hardware hack aimedat improving office workers posture here at theDisrupt NY Hackathon. Hesays he eventually convinced an Uber to take him and the chair to the Manhattan Centre  after some negotiation  so he could get to work on the hack.HeenansPosture.io hackcombines a Texas Instruments Bluetooth Low Energy sensor (which costs $20 to $30) attached to the back of an office chair with velcro, and an adhesive magnetic rubber strip (costing $1-$2) thats stuckto the back of the wearers belt. The TI sensor detects the distance and angle of the magnetic strip on the belt to calculate whether the wearer isslouching or sitting up nice and straight.The app then uses that data tokeep track of the wearers posture score  encouraging them to sit better/slouch less.I look at the sum of square distances between different magnetometerpositions, explains Heenan. So basically your belt is a magnet and the sensor tag measures magnetic fields.And when you lean over, or you slouch, youre basically increasing the distance to the magnet. I can tell the angle as well.Your goal is to keep yourposture score as close to 100 as possible.As well as displaying a large graphic of the users posture (and their posture score) within the app, Posture.iointegrates with the menu bar to display a more discreetreminder of how youre currently sitting. The idea is you dont want something big and in your face, you just want a little status icon of how youre doing over the course of the day, adds Heenan.He says the ideafor the hack came to himaftersome office posture-related health troubles hesuffered recently.About a year ago I had to see a doctor because I was typing too much and I was getting hand injuries, and I looked at a lot of different software but it was all very intrusive. I wanted something that would let me keep my flow when codingI wanted something low cost, easy to use and I found it to be quite robust.A secondary component of the hack involves using the Leap Motion gesture controllerto directthe user to perform atypicalhand exercises which aredesigned to relieve the damaging repetition of typing. Performing a series of hand passes over the controller increases the users posture score.I took some of those exercises from the hand therapy exercises I learnt when I was recovering from the RSI injury, he notes. Bad posture increases your risk of repetitive strain injury.Posture.iocan pushexercise reminder notifications to the Pebble smartwatch.Itcan alsogenerate an Outlook calendar reminder for the user toperform micro exercises if a usersscore looks bad enough.My goal is to keep itas unobtrusive as possible, but if youre being really bad it just puts something on your calendar so you have to do a stretch.There are a few wearable products aimed at improving officer workers posture  such as Lumo Lift  but Heenan says he wanted something less visible and intrusive, that doesnt require something to be clipped onto your clothes. Ive tried a lot of the different other products and just found nothing [I liked], he adds.I have my belt on almost every day so its nothing to change.Heenan, who works for a New York-based startup called Segovia (a digital platform for NGOs to provide direct cash transfer programs to the extreme poor) during the day, was attending his first ever hackathon. This was my oneweekend free.My wife had the baby I got to go do something fun.
