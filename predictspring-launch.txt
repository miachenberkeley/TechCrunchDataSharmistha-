Longtime Googler Nitin Mangtani (manager fora number of productsincluding Google Shopping) has founded a startup of his own, PredictSpring, where hes working to help brands and retailers get up-to-speed with mobile commerce.To illustrate why PredictSpring is necessary, Mangtani pointed to numbers from comScore showing that while 60 percent of retail browsing happens on mobile devices, those devices only account for 15 percent of dollars spent.The experiences on mobile havent caught up with the consumer demand, he said. The consumer is ready to do commerce on mobile.To create those experiences, PredictSpring has created a mobile app development platform that allows businesses to create shopping-enabled apps without writing any code. Businesses using the platform include Cole Haan, Eddie Bauer, Bluefly and Woodcraft  even though Mangtani is only talking publicly about PredictSpring now, the first apps actually went live at the end of last year.PredictSpring has also raised $2 million in funding from investors including fashion tycoon Silas ChousNovel TMT Group and Beanstalk Ventures.Looking at the mobile commerce landscape, Mangtani said there have been a few great hits, likeUber, HotelTonight and Airbnb, but mostshopping apps are justa very thin layer of native code  the moment you click away from the homescreen, youre redirected tothe mobile site.On the other hand, apps created on the PredictSpring platform are supposed to be 100 percent native.Thats important,Mangtani said, because the big innovations in mobile have been on the app side, rather than on the mobile web. Sure, not every Cole Haan customer is going to download the Cole Haan app, but he arguedthat the most loyal ones and the biggest spenders will. Soits important to give them a good experience, where itseasy to actually buy things.The Commerce Gatewayis supposed to provide companieswitha single API where they can integrate things like their e-commerce platform, inventory system, payment provider, product catalog and loyalty program.
