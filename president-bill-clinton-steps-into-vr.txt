As I mentioned during my VR panel at TC Disrupt last week, Bill Clinton has been messing around with virtual reality. Today, Felix & Paul Studios production Inside Impact: East Africa has hit both Oculus (Oculus Store for Gear VP Innovator Edition) and Facebook 360 degree video. For the video embedded below, hit play and drag the screen around to get the full experience.Heres what Flix Lajeunesse, co-founder of Felix & Paul Studios, had to say about the team-up:We are honored to have collaborated with President Clinton and the CGI team to tell this important story. Cinematic virtual reality allows audiences to witness events and moments with an unprecedented sense of awareness, presence, and emotional connection. Through this VR journey, viewers will get to experience the contemporary reality of East Africa in a highly sensorial, immersive way, and witness for themselves the challenges and transformative nature of that part of the world.The guy is a trailblazerremember when he sent his first text message?If you didnt catch our VR panel at Disrupt, have a watch:
