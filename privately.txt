A Swiss spin-out startup from security firmKudelski has relaunched itscontrolled social photo-sharing app, rebranding it asPrivately.The earliertimebombing iOS app  called Secret.li also let users share visually encrypted photos on mainstream social networks in an ephemeral way, choosing to havethe photos disappear after a pre-set interval.Secret.li gainedaround10,000 downloads and some 4,000 active users over its 1.5+ year lifespan, so was clearly ploughing a prettyniche furrow. That appwill now be entirely replaced by Privately, which hasAndroid support, not just iOS. But the main shift here isthe startup is looking to polish up a data protection-focused b2b business, using a consumer app as a showcase to sell services to telcos.Since Secret.li launched there has beenan ongoing drip-feed of digitalprivacy revelations, in the wake ofNSA whistleblower Edward Snowdens release of documents detailing government security agency surveillance activities online. The Snowdenrevelations coincided with the European Commission reworking Europesdata privacy directive a piece of EU work thats still ongoing. Concerns about the data protection compliance of cloud services is something Privately is evidently hoping to capitalize on.The focus for the consumer Privately appcontinues to beon lettingusers share their content in acircumscribed way: so rather than handing over all theirdata (i.e. the photoand itsmetadata) to a third party social network perhapsheadquartered in another country  thereby letting that outside servicedata mine/share their photo data with whatever third parties it chooses  Privately steps in asa localized layer, stripping out photo metadata, encrypting images and then circulating them (via its viewer) on these social platforms, with adde user controls  such as the ability todelete them after the fact.Theappdoes not prevent photos being saved or screengrabbed, once the recipients have viewed them in their visually decrypted form, but the team says itwill beincluding a watermarking feature in a subsequent version that will help users trace any photoleakers.Noris the startupoffering to step out of theencryption loop itself at this point  it does hold encryption keys, so could technically decrypt users data itself (so privacy-concerned users of Privately will still have to trust that its not peeking at their stuff). But it saysits willing to move with market demand there. And touts the specialist encryption knowledge,viaits security firm background, to be able to implement symmetric and end-to-end encryption if its telco clients require.The rebrandedconsumer app is intended as a front-end showcase of thecustomserviceits pitching attelcos and device makers  offeringa custom version of the app they can pre-load or add to a store, with additional features (such as support for videos and documents as well as photos), plus local storage to help themmeetdata protection compliance regulations in their particular region. (Encrypted content related toits consumer app remainslocated inSwitzerland and is handled in accordance with European data laws.)So far, the team hassigned up Indian mobile maker Lava to pre-load its app onto its own-brandhandsets  sousers will be able toselect to share via the Privatelyencrypted lens at the point of snapping a photo or uploading it to a social network from their camera roll. Itsays its alsodiscussions with multiple European and one Asian telco.Why should telcos care about privacy? Compliance with data protection regulations is likely to be the biggest motivator, especially as and when new regulations come into force. The otherreason might be to appeal toconsumers who are growing concerned about their data being tracked and snooped on so as a user acquisition/retention strategy(and thinking of the popularity of ephemeral messaging platformSnapchat).The basic consumer Privately app is freemium, with in-app purchases set to be added to offer another revenue stream down the line,in addition to the teams b2b business.As well as Android support, other new features in the Privately consumer include a one-stop delete button, which lets users delete any content they have previously shared via the app  including any comments they have made. Twitter support is also new (Secret.li wasfocused on Facebook sharing).
