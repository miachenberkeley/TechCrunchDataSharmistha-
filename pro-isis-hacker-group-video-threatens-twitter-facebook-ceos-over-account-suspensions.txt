Twitter and Facebook have recently claimed to be stepping up their fights against extremist content being hosted on their platforms.Indeed, there is some evidence that certain tactics to counter extremists appropriation of mainstream social media platforms such as Twitter deploying repeat account suspensions is having an impact on the spread of extremist propaganda.Earlier this month Twitter blogged about stepping up its fight against violent extremism on its platform, sayingit has increased the size of the teams reviewing reports of problem content and noting it had suspended more than125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist acts, primarily related to ISIS since the middle of 2015 alone.However this more pro-active stance to try to drive ISISoff of mainstream platformsappears to havecaught the attention ofa group of ISIS supporters who have posted a video online which includes what looks to be a direct threat against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, showing their facesbeing riddled withbullet holes.The video was spotted byVocativ, a hybrid media and deep web analysis company,which hasposted twoscreenshots from the video.TechCrunch wasalso able to find the video online and verify that it contains the threatening sequence.The majorityof the video is given over to depictinga series of Facebook and Twitter accounts apparently hacked by the pro-ISIS group whichmade the video andcalls itselfsons of caliphate army.The video also contains amessage,writtenin English,specifically referencing the account bans:You announce daily that you suspend many of our accounts, and to you we say: Is that all you can do? You are not in our league. If you close one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased after we delete your sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true.Its not the first time Twitter and its CEO have been targeted by ISISsupporters to trying to drive extremists off the platform. Back in March last year a post cropped up online threatening Twitter employees and Dorsey specifically.According to Vocativ, the video was being hosted on messaging app Telegram. Arecent studyconducted by an academic from George Washington University which lookedatone group ofISIS supportersuse of mainstream social media suggestsTelegram isbeing favored as a back up for extremists who had been banned from Twitter.Weve asked Telegram for a comment on the video being found on its app and will update this post with any response.Weve also reached out to Twitter and Facebook  neither hadresponded at the time of writing.Telegramhas made its own counter moves against ISIS propaganda, purging a series of pro-ISIS public channelslast Novemberwhich had been allowing extremists tobroadcast pro-ISIS content.However, according to the George Washington University study pro-ISIS supporters have switched to using Telegram groups and supergroups to communicate en masse. Albeit these channels do not allow for unlimited public reach of their recruitment messages as public channels or mainstream social media platforms can.
