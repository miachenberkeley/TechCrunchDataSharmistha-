Its been hard to define exactly what Improbable, the London-based company that raised $20 million fromAndreessen Horowitz in March, doesup until now, but its vision isclearer after it announced Spatial OS  its distributed operating system that is designed to takesimulation and data technology to the next level.Announced by Improbable CEOHerman Narula at the Slush event in Helsinski, Spatial OS is essentially an operating system for developing advanced and large scale data simulations. Ok, so whenwe saidclearer, we mean for those who understand the technologies involved.Either way, theres a huge amount of scope within the capabilities of the OS.Narula explained that  in practical terms  the system canbeen used to create virtual worlds  such asWorlds Adrift, an environment thatis the size of Israel and contains four million entities  and data-centric systems to map and modeltraffic, population, housing,economics and other behaviors.It transforms how we look at complex systems in areas as diverse as city management, defence, economics and entertainment, enabling a new class of applications and businesses for the future, Improbable succinctly explains on its website.Spatial OS, Narula said, integrates a range of modules  such as the Unity gaming engine and popular traffic simulators  and can scale to serve millions of users in the case of consumer products like virtual reality. Mobile devices and VR hardware can be plugged in, he added  without being specific about exactly what devices are supported at this point  to enable developers to build complicated systems usingan SDK and browser-based system for managingapplications.Virtual reality is the most obvious example, because it is so visual, and Worlds Adrift was demonstrated on stage at Slush to illustrate what Spatial OS iscapable of.The capacity of Spatial OS, Narula said, enabled the world to be created at such vastscale but, most impressive, is the fact that it is apersistent environment in which objects remain forever. In other words,if you chop down a tree in one part of the environment or move a table, it will remain untouched and in the same position until someone moves it.But virtual reality is just the tip of the iceberg for how Spatial OS could be applied.Narula said he believes it willallow developers to look again at complex systems and drive new decision making.Someprojects that are currently in development include acomplete model of London  which could be used to runtraffic, population and other simulationsand proposals ranging from rainforest modeling, tosimulations forhousing, the economy and cellular biology.Simulation isnt ready for [modern]uses, Narula said before he introduced Spatial OS. [Its]where data science was in 1970sscaling simulations is like trying to scale up a gigantic circus full of thousands of badly behaved circus acts.With Spatial OS, Improbable hopes that it has created a system for harnessing the potential ofbig data and simulations. The OS is already being used by a handful of selected partners, but developers wanting to get in on the action and enjoy early access can applyon the Improbable website.
