Teslas Model S, a premium performance sedan with dual-motor, all-wheel drive, is advertised as having a 265-mile range, according to the company.But Bjrn Nyland, a programmer at the University of Oslo who lovingly calls his two-year-old Tesla TheMillennium Falcon (he also has a YouTube channel dedicated primarily to his Tesla and their travels together), has apparently justset a world record.Nyland says he just drove a stunning 728 kilometers, or 452.8 miles, on a single charge in his car after fueling up at a supercharger station in Rdekro, Denmark.According to Tesla, the last record of its kind was recorded in May 2012, when a father and son drove 423.5 miles on a single charge.For what its worth, Nyland has no financial relationship with Tesla, says the company. He just really loves his car, seemingly.Nyland and the charitable friendwho drove with him had to cruisean excruciatingly slow 25 miles-per-hour at near zero elevation to pull off the feat.Video taken by Nyland of his trip is about as exhilarating as youd expect as a result.
