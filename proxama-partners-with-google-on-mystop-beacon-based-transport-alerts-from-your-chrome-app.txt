Google has been working for a while nowon ways to bring more Bluetooth beacon projects into its ecosystem, including the launch of itsEddystone open beacon formatand its concept of theapp-freePhysical Web.Today a vendor in the UKunveiled a new project that shows how transportation mightfit into the picture.Proxama, which operates a network of Bluetooth beacons in the UK, says has launcheda new service called MyStop: transport alerts thatcome up automatically on your Android handset or iPhone if you have Chrome installed and Bluetooth turned on. Chrome is the first of these. Proxama claims that otherbrowsers that will eventuallysupport Physical Web notifications from Eddystone beaconsincludeFireFox, Opera and Microsofts new Edge browsers  a collective move, it seems, to rival Apple and its own iBeacons strategy.There are various waystoday that you can use smartphones to get transportation information for example transportation nativeapps, or SMS-based alert services, or web pages that you refresh. But the idea here, aswith Googles Physical Web project in general, is that you dont need any of these.The alerts just come to you, and you can modify them to fit your specific journey. Its an interesting concept for how the future of mobile services might look, especially to a market of consumerswho are later adopters and therefore lessproactive mobile users, or are simply bored of having too many apps.Google is a partner for the service and hasprovided technical support to Proxama throughout the development of the MyStop progressive web app in the lead up to todays latest release of Chrome,Proxamas CEO of proximity marketing, Jon Worley, told TechCrunch. (You can find Chromes release updates here.) Proxama says it has upgraded its own TapPoint marketing platform to work with Googles Physical Web specs, and it looks like the extent of Googles role has been aroundtechnical guidance forbuilding a Progressive Web App and deploying the Physical Web.Initially, the notifications will be focused around London buses, starting with 100 vehicles, but Worleysays that the plan isto expand that across the UK, to other transportation mediums, and toother places where Proxamas beacons are situated. These include high footfall locations like shopping malls, stadiums, city centers and big events, he said.Worley said the service works like this: When a user travels on an enabled buswith a beacon present and that usersphones Bluetooth is on, the Chrome browser will deliver a notification alerting them to the service.By clicking the notification, the user then is directed to a webpage that updates him/heron the progress of ajourney, with real-time updates on delays or alterations to theroute according to the usersexact location. Users can set reminder notifications, for example to get a ping when they are approaching their destination.The data for MyStopis coming from open APIs from Transport for London, the city agency that runs the public transport service. These are free to use.It makes them available for free on the understanding the market will innovate and deliver valuable experiences for their customers, he said.If there arefinancial terms of this service, in fact, they are not really very transparent at the moment  Worley says these cannot be disclosed as Proxama is a listed company (whose shares, I should point out, have jumped almost 20% on this news today).Its clear that Eddystone and the Physical Web creates exciting engagement opportunities for brands to better engage with consumers on the move, saidMike Wood, Product Strategy and Innovation Director, Exterion Media, in a statement. We have enhanced our bus beacon network to support Eddystone and were excited to see how brands take advantage of this. Other beacon projects Exterion has worked on recently include a campaign with Fox and Shazam for Kung Fu Panda 3.With 47% of all handsets shipping with Chrome, this approach enhances the scale of campaigns significantly, and with it the potential to increase the ROIon mobile advertising campaigns, Proxama notes.It doesnt look likeGoogle is involved here beyond education and technical guidance related to Bluetooth networking and implementing an app for thePhysical Web. But as the search giantcontinues to look for new screens and platforms to build its own digital advertisingempire, you can see why it may havean interest in playing a part in futurebeacon networks.
