The PlayStation 4 is a platform that keeps giving, thanks to frequent software updates from Sony. Remote Play for Xperia mobile devices is one such gift, and it works very well on the Xperia Z3, Sonys latest flagship smartphone. The Remote Play app is available now via the Google Play Store for compatible Xperia devices, and anyone who as both one of those and a PS4 at home should grab it.Sonys official Game Control Mount accessory for the DualShock 4 controller makes the overall package even more appealing, turning an Xperia mobile device into a full-fledged in-home mobile gaming console. That both the PS4 and Xperia need to be on the same Wi-Fi network means you cant venture further than your wireless LAN coverage, but its still a great solution for gaming around the house without taking up the primary TV, for just lazing around in bed for a sick day of gaming, or for any other use case where you might ordinarily be forced to sit around and stare at a blank wall or just browse Twitter on your phone while waiting for something else to happen.The potential existing audience for PS4 Remote play on Android is currently probably pretty slim, since you need to own a PS4 and an Xperia device, but the experience is smooth and very satisfying, and likely something that dedicated gamers will be eager to get their hands on. I had a Vita primarily for this very purpose before now, but if I was in the market for a new Android phone, Id probably take a long hard look at Sonys Xperia offerings now that Remote Play is available, since it honestly provides a better remote gaming experience than does Sonys dedicated mobile console.The Game Control Mount retails for around $40, but its worth it if youre looking to get the best possible Remote Play experience out of your Xperia device and the PS4. Plus, if you already have both those devices, its a lot cheaper than a Vita.
