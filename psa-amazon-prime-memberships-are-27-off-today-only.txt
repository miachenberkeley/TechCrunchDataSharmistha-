Dont have Amazon Prime? Want Amazon Prime?What dya know! Amazon Prime is on sale today  a rather rare occurrence.After Prime first launched, it was just $75 a year. In March of 2014, they bumped the price up to $99.Today, in celebration of Amazons wins at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, theyve dropped the price down to $72 bucks. Thats a roughly 27% discount, and is the cheapest Ive ever seen Prime go (besides the free memberships they once offered students).Its a proper Prime membership, too, with all the usual prime perks: unlimited cloud photo storage (as long as youre a member), access to the Prime Video and Music services, access to Kindle Owners Lending Library (assuming you have a Kindle  not just a Kindle app on your iPad), and, the flagship feature, free two-day shipping on most (not all) Amazon items.One catch: technically, its only available to new members. If you already have Prime, Amazon wants you to cough up the standard fee. Because, hey, theyve already got you hooked. Attempting to buy todays deal as a current Prime member throws up an error at checkout.Some folks on Twitter are reporting that you can circumvent this limitation by disabling auto-renew on your Prime account, then buying yourself todays deal as a gift (sent to yourself) with the arrival date set to one day after your Prime account expires. It almost certainly works (the same trick worked when Amazon was about to crank the price up)  but whether or not that little work around is too sketchy is up to you.You can find the discounted Prime page here.[via Slickdeals]
