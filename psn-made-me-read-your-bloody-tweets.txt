Yes, its that part of the day where we get to check in on fun things that are broken while youre doing actual work. Todays fun thing thats broken is PlayStation Network (PSN).People are saying things like this:PSN is down so instead of a few frames of street fighter I have to read a bloody BOOK GaryDooton (@GaryDooton) July 14, 2015This man is threatening to read a book and I feel really bad for him. Whats wrong with you, Sony? Why isnt the PlayStation Network up? Its Twitter helpline is trying to triage the issues.First things first, talk to your local support team.@MezuTinho Hi there, Please contact your local support team for proper assistance. http://t.co/qMj9WfYUXF Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) July 14, 2015Is that like AA for gamers?PlayStation Network has had its share of issues;lets hope this time is nothing major.Its status update page is a little hard to follow, but there are red dots, which probably means something is wrong.Weve reached out to Sony for comment and will update once we hear back.We never heard back from Sony about this, but the status page shows that all systems are go.
