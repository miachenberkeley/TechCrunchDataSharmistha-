Content publishing platform RebelMouse has raised $6 million in an extended Series Afrom previous investorsSoftbank CapitalandOak Investment Partners, with additional participation fromBuddy Medias Mike Lazerow. This brings the total up to $18.8 million total for the startup.AnSEC filing first alerted us to the news that something was going on, however this was apparently an exchange of $16 million in stock for the company. Founder and CEO Paul Berrylater confirmed to TechCrunch thatthere hadbeena growth round that had closed at the beginning of this year.RebelMouse started out as a way for companies to aggregate their social media networks into a social front page. It has since morphed into a full CMS platform for brands and media. But itwas just a twinkle in Berrys eye back in his days as the Huffington Posts CTO.Berrybuilt the Huffington Postfrom scratch back in 2007 after it came to his attention thatpeoplewanted to share content on the site. Soon other media sites were asking how Berrycould help them do the same thing and RebelMouse was born.RebelMouse nowhelps startups, media sites and brands build out sites around social media marketingwith an easy-to-use interface. It has also added the ability to build mobile applications and native apps through the platform as well as content communities and social A/B testing as notifications getpushed out into other networks.The idea is similar in many ways to WordPress or Drupal  though Berry contends theseother CMS platformsare difficult for those creating the content to operate. Its a totally different approach to the same problem, Berry said.People who create great content shouldnt have to have the tech team to handle all that for them.RebelMouse introducedTheRiver late last year. This is a content aggregation tool that looks similar to the newsfeed river we display on the front page of TechCrunch. The startup is also working on a few stealth projects with several brands. Berry hinted at something brewing with GE around a new content experience, though he said he couldnt elaborate on that just yet.Some of the new funding will go towards improving on the product and to amp up the product and tech teams, but the majority will be used tohiremore sales people, particularly those who can go after household brands and media sites. RebelMouse already hired Craig Fanning, the previous Western regional sales director at Adobe, to help it accomplish the goal of bringing in bigger enterprise clients.Hiring on the sales team and going for more media and brands is our most important focus right now, said Berry.
