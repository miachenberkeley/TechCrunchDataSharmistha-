Since around March of last year, Pushbullet has done a damned good job of forwarding messages and notifications from your Android phone to your Mac.Today, Pushbullet gains support for iOS  and while theyre at it, theyve launched a dedicated Mac app and raised $1.5 million.Theyve put together a pretty solid demo video of their new iOS app, but heres the basic rundown of what Pushbullet can do:Simultaneously, the company is announcing that itraised a seed round of $1.5 million. Investors in this round are General Catalyst, SV Angel, Paul Bucheit (creator of Gmail), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit co-founder; part time YC Partner), Garry Tan (Posthaven co-founder; YC Partner) and other angel investors that were not disclosed.And to round off a day of news, the companyalso launched a dedicated Mac app and a Safari extension. Pushbullet originally began its life as a Chrome extension, eventually finding its way to Firefox and Opera. Now its compatible with just about every major browser  or as its own thing, no browser required. You can find the dedicated Mac app right here, and the new iOS app here.Ive been using Pushbullet since I first wrote about it back in March  and without realizing it, its become something of a staple in my workflow. I didnt notice how much I leaned on it until I had to clear off my Android phone and subsequently spent a few days without it; until I got around to reinstalling it, my phone felt hobbled.
