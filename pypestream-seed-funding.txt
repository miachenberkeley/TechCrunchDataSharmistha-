Pypestream, a new startup from AdGenesis/Genesis Media co-founder Richard Smullen, is announcing that it has raised $2 million in seed funding.The round was led by Jonah Goodhart, co-founder of Moat and of early-stage investment firm WGI Group. Goodhart told me that Pypestream is trying to solve a big problem: The call center as a model is absolutely broken. In other words, think about all the times youve tried to call customer service, and how often its an extraordinarily frustrating experience.How does Smullens startup solve that? Well, it doesntofficially launchfor another week or so, and he wasnt ready to share many details. The aim, at least, is to create an experience thats closer to messaging with your friend than it is to a traditional customer service call, while still providingthe enterprise features that businesses want.Smullen also said that he wants Pypestream to become a platform where businesses want to be found  in fact, you can already reserve your company name now.But what, exactly, are you reserving? Well, stay tuned for the launch. In the meantime, I guess I shouldremind you that Smullens previous company AdGenesis was a video advertising startup that merged with Castle Vision Media to form an ad tech company called (drumroll) Genesis Media.
