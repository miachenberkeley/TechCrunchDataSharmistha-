Qardio started out building medical heart sensors to improve health. Now theyre branching out into more accessible territory including connected scales and blood pressure cuffs.Called the QardioBase and QardioArm, the devices are designed to take your vital measurements and report on your health. The Base, thankfully, can even be put into happy mode that displays a happy or sad face instead of a weight  a boon to the preternaturally plump. Pregnancy mode lets mothers follow their weight gain on the fly.We talked to the co-founder, Marco Peluso, about the new products. We should be seeing them in stores this spring.
