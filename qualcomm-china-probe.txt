Qualcomm has been fined close toone billion dollars in China after regulators found the U.S. chip-maker guilty of breaching national antitrust regulations.The company, the worlds largest supplier of chips for mobile phones, agreed to pay a6.088 billionyuan (approximately$975 million) penalty and said it has agreed to split its3G/4G essential patents separately toother licenses in China. Existing licensees will be able to choose new terms as of January 1 2015.Qualcomm did not contest the fine butit did expressdisappointment with the result of the investigation, which hadbeen ongoing for more than a year and cast significant doubtsover its business in China  although the company continued to make investments there.Possible outcomes of the probe had affected Qualcomms most recent financial performance and its stock price, which suffered its highest drop in over three years after its Q3 2014 earnings last year. Customers had delayed royalty payments, or underpaid Qualcomm, as they waited for clarity on the firms legal status in the country.Yet, despite the large fine, a resolution with regulators and an end to the uncertainty is a positive outcome, particularly when considering the size of the Chinese market agovernment report this month claimedChina now has 557 million mobile internet users.Analyst Mike WalkleyofCanaccord Genuity told Bloomberg that the result is a net positive when its all shook out, and Qualcomm CEOSteve Mollenkopf chose to focus on the future.We are pleased that the resolution has removedthe uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources onsupporting our customers and partners in China and pursuing the many opportunities ahead,he said in a statement.This case could be a litmus test for future crackdowns on Western companies. Microsoft and Symantec are among other overseas companies that have been targeted by government investigations, as media reports continue to speculate that China is keen to cut its dependence on overseas software and hardware companies.
