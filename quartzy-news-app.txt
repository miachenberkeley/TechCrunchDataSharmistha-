If youre tired of news apps that all look the same, youll want to take a look at the iPhone app that Quartz just put out.The news site, which is owned byAtlantic Media,is known for taking a different approach to publishing.Quartz executive editor Zach Seward once described it as an APIthat can go anywhere our readers are, in whatever form is appropriate,and the site is well known for its daily newsletter, which has over 185,000 subscribers and an impressive 40 percent open rate.With this app (an Android version is coming soon), Quartz has dispensed with the conventional approach to news and instead introduced a chat messaging interface through which content is delivered.Using a clear and clean design aesthetic, the Quartz bot interacts with you, offering up news stories which you can choose to get more information about or move on to the next. Links, which include some stories that arent from Quartz, are subtly held within some (but not all) chat bubbles, while theres a dash of playful emojis and GIFs and the bot uses while typing icons, too. During downtime between stories, the app even served me a quiz question.Beyond chat, there are push notifications, a chart of the day extension, and an Apple Watch app that gauges the markets with an emoji on your watch face.Our Apple Watch complication tells you how the market is doing in the form of an emoji.

With a little more personalization it could become a keeper, a news app to complement your existing news apps.We had a suspicion [that this]could be an interesting way to get the news across, Seward told TechCrunch in a phone interview. We dont know yet how [we will] expand [the app] or what features to add because the first step is to see how people are using it.Rather than merely postinglinks or copying content from its stories, Quartz developed dedicated content for the app usinga team of writers led by Adam Pasick, who ranReuters futuristic foray into Second Life back in 2006  a tech and design team, and even a dedicated CMS.Interestingly, the Quartz news bot app is sponsored. Messaging is a notoriously challenging medium to monetize, and popular consumer chat apps have sofar hadmost success around sellingdigital goods like stickers or offline services. Quartz is using subtle advertising, with Mini itsinitial launch partner.Messaging continues to become a growing medium for publishers  BuzzFeed, for one, runs its social and messaging accounts like a newspaper runs its daily edition  but for many it is unclear how to proceed.Quartz is taking a big step that is sure to help it learn more about the future of messaging as a news medium. It isnt hard to imagine this very same experience being tweaked and replicated across multiple chat messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger, Kik or WeChat in the future. For now, though, this isphase one.You can get the Quartz app here.
