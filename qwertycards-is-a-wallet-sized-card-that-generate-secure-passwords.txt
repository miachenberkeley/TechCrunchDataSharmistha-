Do you still useone generic password to loginacross multiple websites? Even though its a pretty awful habit, youre probably not alone.Most of of us now have hundreds of accounts for different sites across the internet. That means unless you use a password manager, its practically impossible to remember a unique password foreach site.Heres another solution for you: London-basedQwertycards is a plastic, wallet-sized card that helps you generate and remember strong and unique passwords.This is how it works:Each printed card is one-of-a-kind, containing a unique base code as well as a printed QWERTY keyboard where each letter on the keyboard is assigned to a unique character.To generate a new password, users first type the unique base code at the bottom of the card,followed by a secret word chosen by the user, and finally thecode characters for each letter of the website name.So for example, using the keyboard above to generate a loginfor Amazon, the secure password would be:sh(/J3Hq******.u.rqf, with ***** representing your secret word.The magic in this is that each printed card is a true one-off, meaning that no other Qwertycard will have your same combination of letters and characters.The company does, however, include one copy with your order,in case your ever lose your original card.One card runs $4.99 (with free shipping), just a fraction of the cost of software-based solutions like 1password, and a trivial price to pay in return for the peace of mind that comes with having truly unique passwords.
