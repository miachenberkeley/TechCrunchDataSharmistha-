Earlier this year, I had the great pleasure of interviewing Kathryn Gould, one of the very first women venture capitalists, and surely the sassiest.She also had  and may still have  among the better track records in venture investing history.Gould passed away earlier today after a battle with cancer, and its a surely a loss for everyone who knew her well. (I know Im very sad that Ill never have the chance to talk with her again.)Read part of that interviewfrom this past February, and youll have the tiniest appreciation for whyshe was so &#*#fantasticand so widely revered by many in Silicon Valley.
