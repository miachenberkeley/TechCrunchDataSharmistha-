Japan-headquartered e-commerce firm Rakuten has written down $340 millionfrom a range of businesses, including its Kobo e-reader division and France-based e-commerce site PriceMinister, and announced plans toclose a number of global operations as part of a new strategic focus.Rakuten announced its latestfinancial results today, and they werent great. Net profit for the year slipped38 percent year-on-year to44.3 billion JPY ($393 million) on revenue of714 billion JPY ($6.3 billion)  up 19 percent. Part of thoseresultsincluded a write-down of38.1 billion JPY ($339 million) in consolidatedimpairment losses.The changes come fromRakutens new 2020 Vision (PDF), a business realignment strategy announced today,and theybreakdown as follows:Rakuten added that the (non-consolidated) loss on valuation of stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates came in at62.3 billion JPY, thats around $554 million.The companys share price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped seven percent in response to the news. Itstotal market cap stood at1.436 trillion JPY ($12.75 billion) at the end of trading.Rakutens share price over the last yearExplaining the measures, the company saidin a statement that PriceMinister had been affected by the competitive environment of the French e-commerce market, while its write-down for Kobo was a result of a slower start to the rise of the global ebook industry than we originally expected.That disappointment is tempered by some optimism. Rakuten saidthat PriceMinisterhas an important position in the European e-commerce space. Likewise, it is estimated its e-book division  which includes content platform OverDrive, bought for $410 million one year ago, and Kobo  will return to profitability in 2016.One line item filed under other costs looks to be a restructuring of Rakutens marketplaces outside of Japan. The company confirmed in an announcement (PDF) that it will close down its e-commerce sites inSingapore, Malaysiaand Indonesia next month, andit is looking to offload Tarad.com, the e-commerce company in Thailand that it acquired in 2010, too.Those closures will mean that around150 staff are laid off, Rakuten confirmed to TechCrunch, but the companywill retain its regional office in Singapore,which will continue to house Rakuten Ventures andRakuten Travel. Its e-commerce business in Taiwan, which appears to be performing far better, will also remainunaffected.Rakuten Singapores websiteThese marketplace are being replaced by a new project in Southeast Asia, a consumer-to-consumer app called Rakumawhich, Rakuten said, has grown 20 percent month-on-month in Japan.That concept sounds a lot like (indeed, the same as) Carousell, theapp that Rakuten Ventures is an investor in. Singapore-based Carousell is currently in three countries in Southeast Asia but, aswe reported late last year, it istrying toraise a $50 million round to expand its service significantly across Asia.It seems a little odd to pit Rakuma against Carousell. When we asked Rakuten for more details about that, it told us that its the plans are still under consideration and we look forward to sharing more detail on this soon.Beyond Asia, Rakuten will also shutter its marketplace business in Brazil, but Ikedia, its service that enablesretailers to develop and managetheir online commerce presence, will remain open.Update: Rakuten has not closed its site in Brazil, but it has shifted the model from a marketplace to a Saas-based approach. Thats powered by Ikedia,another Rakuten acquisition  the company bought a 75 share for an undisclosed sum back in 2011.Rakuten has exited countries in Asia before  it quit a joint venture with Baidu in China, and dissolved a partnership in Indonesia in favor of flying solo  but these withdrawsare far more strategic and wider reaching.Chairman and CEOHiroshi Mikitani, who took the step of addressing investors in Japanese not English as is usual onRakuten results days, stressed that the 2020 Vision is based around three core principles: strong, smart and speed. Highlighting a number of new businesses that include acquisitions Viki, Ebates and Viber,Mikitani made bold growth predictions and hailed the disruptive potential of these mobile technologies when combined with Rakutens core e-commerce businesses.But Rakutens maindomestic business is stagnating. Its Japanesee-commerce division grew 10 percent on GMV  the total amount of goods sold on platforms  but profit was up just six percent and revenue 13 percent on the previous financial year. Rakutens Internet services division has expanded with someearly promise in Japan  revenue grew 22 percent with profit up 45 percent year-on-year  but theres also pressure on overseas investments to pull in cash to compensate.Mikitani placed plenty of emphasis on Ebates, the cash-back website it bought for $1 billion in 2014, which Rakuten said contributed significantly to the growth of its overseas businesses, with GMV rising 43 percent annually to $4.9 billion. Under its new plan, Ebates is tipped to triple to $15 billion GMV by 2020.Thats the model that the company is looking for, butits tough to find that in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Brazil. Yes, millions of new Internet users are coming online via smartphones, but theres plenty of competition in e-commerce (Rocket Internet alone has poured more than $1 billion into its two players in Southeast Asia) while buying online is not yet a mainstream trend among consumers. As a result, Rakuten looks to beclearing out its longer-term, less-certain bets and doubling down where it believes the healthiest chances of returns lie.Note: The headline and article was updated to clarify that Rakuten has changed its marketplace model in Brazil. The write-downs on Kobo and PrimeMinister werealso corrected.
