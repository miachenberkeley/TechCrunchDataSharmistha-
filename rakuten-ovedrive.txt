Rakuten is beefing up its digital content chops after it announced the acquisition of ebook and audiobook marketplace OverDrive for $410 million.The Japanese e-commerce giant got into the e-reader game when itpicked up hardware makerKobo for $315 million in 2011. It stands to reason then that U.S.-based OverDrive, which was founded way back in 1986 andoffers over2.5 million titles from more than 5,000 publishers today, will be put to work providing greater choice and reading material for Kobo owners.OverDrives deep content library and relationships with publishers, libraries, schools, and retailers will allow Rakuten to extend our mission of empowerment to new market segments and accelerate the growth of our digital contents businesses, saidTakahito Aiki, Head of Rakutens global eBook business, in a canned statement.Interestingly, Rakuten claimed that the addition of OverDrive  which is expected to closenext month  will push its eBook business close to breakeven before the end of this year. Thats thanks to OverDrive financials, which included end of year (EBITDA) revenue of $25 million for 2014.Rakuten isnt just pushing reading and audio material, it has made substantial investments in entertainment content too. It acquired global video platform Viki for $200 millionin 2013, and it has steadily broadened the scope and availability of its Netflix-like video platformWuaki  a Rakuten purchase in 2012.Chat and calling app Viber is another of Rakutens most prominent acquisitions. The service, which was bought for $900 million last year, is seen internally as a key part to extending the reach of Rakutens vast e-commerce empire to mobile devices  and gaining greater tractions in markets like Asia and Latin America. There are obviously synergies for Rakutens entertainment services here too, and TechCrunch understands that Viki and Wuakiwill have greater prominence within the Viber service over time.
