In the world of gaming accessories, budget-friendly is not a word frequently used. Naturally, one of the biggest players industry, Razer, aims to change that with the Blackwidow X.The newest set of keyboards addedto their existing lineup, the Blackwidow X has changes made not only to improve simplicity, but to promote more competitive (e.g. budget-friendly) pricing for gaming keyboards, overall.Starting at $130, its $10 cheaper than the previousgeneration, yet features a new in-house switch design called theRazer Mechanical Switch, which has apurported increase in lifespan of 80 million key strokes.Some quick mathematics: 80 million key strokes is around 4-5 years of normal usage, or 2-3 years if used for gaming.Also important iswhat Razer callsChroma lighting custom individual backlighting for each key  which stays in all of its colorful stupor despite the change in keyboard technology and price reduction.However, there are some compromises: no USB ports on the keyboards or top body layer  essentially youre getting a more minimalistic design. To compensate, the existing line of keyboards with the aforementioned features will stay.Thenew line of (slightly) price conscious keyboards arenow available at the aptly named Razer Store.
