India has welcomed an international music streaming service to its shores: Rdio, the San Francisco based company, has launched in the country.Rdios arrival in India has been expected for some time since it acquired domestic streaming company Dhingana for an undisclosed price back in early 2014. Dhingana, which had over 10 million users at its peak, lost key deals with record labels, but Rdios entry is a different story since it comes with a vast library of 32 million songs, both international and India.Rdio may be the biggest international streaming service now in India, and its made it there ahead of rivals Spotify and Deezer,but its not the first.Prior to this, Australias Guvera, which is active across Asia, launched in November 2014.Rdio CEO Anthony Bay was keen to stress that the service will be an international-domestic hybrid in India.Weve got a lot of respect for the music streaming companies that compete locally in India, thats one reason that we entered by acquiring someone. Weve brought that experience and DNA from Dhingana into Rdios India offering, he told TechCrunch in an interview.Bay said that India is Rdios largest office outside of the U.S., and he believes that there is a real opportunity to make a mark in the country thanks in no small part to the huge growth in smartphone ownership that is projected over the coming years.The premium Rdio service will be priced at US$1.99 (INR 120) per month in India, but the company is also introducing its a free internet radio player for mobile in the country. That radio app has not been rolled out to all Rdios markets in Asia at this point, but Bay sees its potential to help the service reach consumers in India.We believe that classical experience of radio will appeal to many people in India, such is the broad audience of people who just want to listen to things, he explained.India has been a tough market for paid media services due to rampant piracy, but with a growing field of options  including rival services Gaana and Saavn  Bay believes that offering compelling alternatives is a significant step to reducing the amount of music piracy.Rdios launch in India takes the service to 61 markets worldwide, and it also active in a handful of other countries in Asia. The company has plans to advance its presence in the region with more launches in Southeast Asia, and the introduction of its free radio service in more Asia markets too.Bay said Rdio plans to reach 100 countries by the end of this year, but his mission is never over until we have every song ever recorded on every device worldwide.How does China fall into that plan?Bay said there has been demand from Rdios partners  including automobile and hardware companies  to have its service in China, and the company is evaluating a lot of the ways to enter.Yes, we would like to be in China in a thoughtful way, Bay added.Rdio doesnt reveal how many users it has  paid or free  and that policy isnt changing for now. Likewise, Bay didnt give any information about user acquisition targets in India  but, as the first of the global services to enter, Rdio will be keen to make its large catalog of music makes its mark with consumers indiaspora.Competition-wise, n diaspora.Competition-wise, Gaana offers a free radio service and premium packages priced from $3.99. It has a library of 3 million tracks, both international and domestic. While Saavn, the other major rival, also offers a free app, and gives full access to over three million songs Hungama.com ar $3.60 (220 INR).Hungama.com and Australia-headquarted Guvera also compete, but Rdios initial pricing undercuts all of its competitors.Amazon has also been rumored to enter the music market in India too. Last year it allocated a $2 billion to growing its presence in the country, though the primary focus of that is likely to be its e-commerce business, and entry into media is not out of the question.The Indian market is increasing a target for overseas tech companies across a range of verticals, and with Rdio now arrived, it surely wont be too long before others in the streaming business follow suit.
