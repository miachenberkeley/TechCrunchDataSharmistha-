A fair amount of folks reported yesterday that Apple was testing its own MVNO (mobile virtual network operator), to become, in essence, a mobile carrier while borrowing components from other carriers. Youd be paying Apple for your calls, texts and data. Fancy.Its not the first time that Apple nerds have thought this was happening, given the MVNO patents that surfaced back in 2011.Alas, according to a statement we received from an Apple spokesperson, its not happening:We have not discussed nor do we have any plans to launch an MVNO.That statement leaves no wiggle room. So.No MVNO from Apple.  The stock market is responding to the denial, with the stock down 3%. I mean, becoming a mobile carrier is a romantic idea, but probably a waste of time and cash. In fact, our own Matthew Panzarino, figures it would be smarter to acquire a carrier rather than roll its own. Google, on the other hand, is moving forward with Project Fi, its MVNO project.I imagine that AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and the rest are pretty happy to hear that they wont be fending off Apple (and its weapons of mass marketing) for wireless customers. I mean, even though the virtual network that was proposed wouldnt truly be an Apple-built network, consumers of Apple products have no problem paying Apple for just about anything.Sorry Apple fans, reach out and touch someone else.
