Editors note: Liraz Margalit serves as customer experience psychologist for ClickTale, whichhelps businessesoptimize visitor interactions with their websites.Considera scene that happens a billion times a day, at a billion computers across the globe. A man is searching online for new running shoes, or a woman is clicking through e-commerce sites on the hunt fora birthday gift,a new dress or a book to read on her next vacation.Shoppers navigating the online marketplace think they are in control of their decisions. But the truth is, as they scroll and browse andperhapsbuy, there are dozens of unconscious processes and cues directing their behavior.Forbusinesses with online marketplaces, understanding how these unconscious cues affect consumers is crucial.The most researched indicationofthis automaticprocessis the priming effect,which says thattheexposure to one stimulus influences the waywerespondto another stimulus.We know thatourmentalparadigms  how wecategorize things around us like to lump similar themes and thoughts together. So if we show a subject the word housewife and thenone of two new words, woman or pilot,hewill recognize woman quicker because brain activation spreads faster among related ideas.This can be uncomfortable to admit, because no one likes to say that they believe in stereotypes. But we learn these connections early, and they are buried in our unconscious.Not only has thepriming effectbeen shown to influence our thoughts and feelings, it can also influence our behavior.If were shown a picture of an elderly couple, for example, we automatically (and unconsciously) start to elicit stereotype-consistent behaviors like slower walking.Research shows that these ideas are learned early in life, often before people have the ability to override or reject them.ClickTaleranan experiment to test the power of unconscious gender stereotypes online. Using A/B testing, we created two versions of our homepage  one featuring a female hero image, and one featuring a male hero image. Then, using our own software, we had two separate test groups try our site, and tracked their interactions with elements on the page:what they clicked on, how far they scrolled, what their next pages were, etc.Over the course of the experiment we used Optimizely to A/B test our two calls to action on the pageRequest a Demoand Try ClickTale.Additional elements on the page that we tracked included:clicks on product images or features, Blog, Why ClickTale and Search.Below are four key findings:The results are inline with the priming effect: Visitors who saw a male image chose to click on the Try ClickTale button  an active approach. Visitors who saw the female image instead opted for Request a Demo  a more passive approach. Does that mean women are passive and men are active? No, ofcourse not. Butpeoples online behavior is in line withthe stereotypes we unconsciously assign tomales and females.Visitors who were exposed to the male heroalsoshowed significantly higher click-through rates on theProduct FeaturesandSearch buttons,reflecting an active goal-oriented approach of exploring what ClickTale is.It alsoreflects a tendency to be activeand in control ofyourinteractionon the page.In comparison, visitors who were exposed to the femalehero were much quicker to click onWhy ClickTaleand theBlog buttons, two areas of the site that symbolize more of a passive exploration. Clicking on elements such asWhy ClickTaleor the company blogshows anindirect approach to gainingmore knowledge about thecompany.But results can be misleading: Had we only checked how the images affected conversion, thenwe would have seen thatfemale hero images, and not the male ones,lead to higher conversion rates. Butby applying the psychological theory of the priming effect, I was able to understand the cause of the behavior and understand whythe male image caused a more direct and proactive approach to learning about the company and acquiring the product.This provided a useful takeaway that web designers and marketers can learn from:When it comes to behavior online, its not what meets the eye that always counts. Itswhat meets the brain, before the eye even sees it, before your conscious can even understand why you feel the way you feel.Understanding the effects of the priming theory and how to apply it  is the secret to enterprisesgaininga competitive edge online.
