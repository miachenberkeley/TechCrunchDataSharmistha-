On the fourth anniversary of Steve Jobs death, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out a memo to Apple employees. It is slim on details but it does outline some of the priorities Jobs seemed to hold and its a fascinating and beautiful document from one friend and co-worker about another.Steve was a brilliant person, and his priorities were very simple. He loved his family above all, he loved Apple, and he loved the people with whom he worked so closely and achieved so much, wrote Cook. Each year since his passing, I have reminded everyone in the Apple community that we share the privilege and responsibility of continuing the work Steve loved so much.Jobs illness and death were unique primarily in the outpouring of grief that seemed to well up around the world. Most would say that a man who made shiny boxes didnt deserve as many tears as he got but Cook knows the score:It can also be said he left too soon.He told me several times in his final years that he hoped to live long enough to see some of the milestones in his childrens lives. I was in his office over the summer with Laurene and their youngest daughter. Messages and drawings from his kids to their father are still there on Steves whiteboard, wrote Cook.Below find the full memo.Team,Today marks four years since Steve passed away. On that day, the world lost a visionary. We at Apple lost a leader, a mentor, and many of us lost a dear friend.Steve was a brilliant person, and his priorities were very simple.
