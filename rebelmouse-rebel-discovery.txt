Social media startup RebelMouse has created a new tool for publishers  Rebel Discovery, which helps those publishers identify the social media accounts that they should be sharing stories with for maximum impact.Founder and CEO Paul Berry said that when you publish a story, there are probably many Facebook Pages or Twitter accounts that would be happy to post a link  not because theyre getting paid (although Rebel Discovery can be used to manage those relationships, too), but because theyre hungry for content, its relevant to their followers and/or they want to build a relationship with the publisher. The challenge is finding those accounts.So Rebel Discovery can use a storys tags to bring up accounts that are relevant to a given topic and have high organic engagement. When publishers have stories they want to promote, they can reach out to the accounts that Rebel Discovery recommends and ask if theyre willing to share.Rebel Discovery also comes with analytics, sothe publisher can see the engagement around each post that an account has shared  both the links to their stories and to everything else.We dont have to be the CMS anymore, Berry said. You can be using WordPress, Drupal, Adobe, it doesnt matter.The company says that in early testing, Rebel Discovery results in an average of 20 percent lift in pageviews while only requiring 75 seconds of an editors time per story.RebelMouse recently added support for publishing Facebook Instant Articles, too.
