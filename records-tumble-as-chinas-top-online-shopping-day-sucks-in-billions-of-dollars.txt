Were barely halfway through Singles Day, Chinas largest online shopping day, but already the records are tumbling.Alibaba, the most visible and best-known online retailer from China, and its chief rival JD.com both surpassed their final talliesfrom November 11 2014 at around todayshalfway mark.Alibaba had beaten its $9.2 billion tally from last year by 12:30, while JD.com topped the 14 million orders that it clocked in 2014 by 11:30.(For reference, spending onThanksgiving in the U.S. is estimated to have topped $1 billion last year, with Black Friday 2014 saidto have reaped$1.5 billion  yes, Chinas Singles Day is an online sales bonanza and then some.)Just surpassed last year's Total GMV in USD! #1111Fest Read live updates on Alizila https://t.co/GHXuw1MOTz pic.twitter.com/kEuQ7dOrFL Alizila.com (@Alizila) November 11, 2015At 11.58am this morning, we topped total #SinglesDay orders for 2014! $JD #BreakingRecords JD.com Spokesman (@JD_Spokesman) November 11, 2015This growth from China is impressive, but also somewhat inevitable.Alibaba,JD.com, and others have spent at least a month publicizing their Singles Day initiatives to customers, as the importance and visibility of online commerce continues to risein China.Also, both companies saw huge year-on-year growth on Singles Day 2014. Alibabas gross sales grew to $9.3 billion from $5.75 billion in 2013; JD.com said its order numbers were120 percent higher on Singles Day 2014 than 2013.Beyond the dizzying figures, Singles Day is a chance to look at upcoming trends in Chinas e-commerce market, and most notably that means mobile and customers in morerural areas. Last year, more than 40 percent of Alibabas 11/11 revenue came from customers usingmobile devices, while smaller towns and cities were cited as a fast-growing segment, albeit without a raw stat to back that up.This year, 11/11 fever has spread into other parts of the world, and not just as a result of Alibaba, Amazon or other companies global tentacles. InIndia, 11/11 has combined with Diwali to become a major sales campaign for Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, while e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia are also trying to get in on the festivities with a two-day sale for customers in the region.On first glance, however, it looks like itll be some time before theseexported sales drives gain anything like the kind of momentum that they enjoy in China, where the sales are truly mainstream. Alibaba, for example,sold more than 200,000 bottles of detergent on 11/11 last year, while JD.com saidsales of imported milk rose 900 percent.Lazadas front page right now  11/11 sales in Southeast Asia have a long way to go to reach China levels pic.twitter.com/KGX2JyfIUv Jon Russell (@jonrussell) November 11, 2015Chinese users now plan their shopping around this promo day,Hans Tung, managing partner of GGV Capital (an early investor in Alibaba) toldus during last years sales event. They have come to expect great deals. And are willing to wait for it to buy. So this sales record will likely be broken every year.
