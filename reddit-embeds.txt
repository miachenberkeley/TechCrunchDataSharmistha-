Reddit posts are going to get the chance to live beyondReddit itself, thanks to new embedding capabilities.If youre an online writer or publisher, that means you can start including live Reddit content in your stories. If youre a reader, that means you might start to see more Reddit posts on other sites, the same way you can see embedded tweets and YouTube videos.After all, Reddits head of journalism and media Mark Luckie pointed out that news stories come out of the site all the time  for example when notable figures participate in an Ask Me Anything session. And yes, TechCrunch certainly isnt above turning a controversial AMA into a story.The difference now is that journalists wont have to rely on links and screenshots  if theyre summarizing a noteworthyAMA, they can just dropthe actual posts with the best quotesinto their stories. (You might still want to save a screenshot, just in case the poster wants to revise a controversial statement, but Luckie said thats not very common.)Healso suggested that this could bea way for publishers to include commentary and reactions directly in their articles, rather than just relegating themto a comment thread below.The great thing about Reddit content is that its usually longer, its more insightful, more in-depth than youll see on other social platforms, Luckie said. Youre going to get a more robust conversation.If readers see a postthey want to respond to, they can click on a link in the embed and jump straight into the conversation. Luckie suggested that when Redditors see their comments embedded on other sites, they might share those stories on Reddit itself.While the company plans to make every post on the site embeddable anywhere on the web, its also working with a number of initial publisher partners  including AOL, which owns TechCrunch. (Were working to bring the embeds to TechCrunch, but were still figuring out some of the technical kinks. In the meantime, you can see some examples here.)Were thrilled to have partnered with amazing content providers, including: AOL, TIME Inc, and Advance Local, said Reddits director of business development Alexandra Riccomini in an emailed statement. We see the embeds as entre to a series of publisher tools were hoping to roll out, in coordination with publishers.
