Elisa Schreiber is the marketing partner at Greylock Partners and the producer of the Greymatter video series.Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman recallsa tense board meeting when his companydiscussed eliminating itscustomer commission refund in the latest Greymatter video from Greylock Partners.Typically in real estate transactions, the seller of a home pays acommission of 5% which is split between the sellers agent and thebuyers agent. Traditional brokerages keep all of their commission. With Redfin, the company shares a portion of the commissionwith their customers.After analyzing the data, Redfin learned they could eliminate the commission refund and it would not impact demand.Glenn hesitated to present this data to the Board. He knew that the commission refund was a critical part of Redfin fulfilling their mission, but that the board would push him to do the rational thing: maximize profits at the expense of the mission.Surprisingly, a member of the board asked him, Nameone great brand that was built by someone that was entirelyrational.That question gave Kelman the permission to think a bit irrationally.When you want to do something no one else can, he says, youwill always find a way to pay for it as long as the customer valuesit.
