It isnt as powerful as Scrivener or Ulysses, but it isnt really the point. You can write your first draft in Scrivener, and then do the rest in Reedsy.You could think about this book editor as a Google Docs for books. It lets you write and edit in your browser and everything is saved in real time. Multiple persons can edit at the same time, make comments and track changes. It replaces the cumbersome back-and-forth process involving Word documents and weird file names.When everything is done, you can tweak the layout and export your book into a publishable ePub and PDF. After that, authors can self-publish their books on the Kindle Store, iBooks Store or do whatever they want with them. PDFs are compatible with most print-on-demand services.In addition to Reedsys author profiles, todays new book editor is a great way to make people sign up and use the service.
