Everyone dreads them: The annual performance review. After all, its hard foremployees to do much with a yearly sit-down where some past accomplishments and failings are outlined, and a vague improvement plan with far-off objectives isset in place.Numerous companies have emerged in recent year to kill such reviews, including pulse survey startups like Tiny Pulse that produce frequent, anonymous employee polls to help bosses understand in real time who is happy, who isnt, and what they can do about it.Reflektive, a year-old, San Francisco-based employee engagement and performance platform, is taking things in a slightly different direction by making it easier for colleagues and managers to deliver real-time feedback via Gmail, Outlook and Slack.With a pop up tab that appears in the body of an email, a colleague can provide feedback about what someone did particularly well any time theyre moved to do so. Meanwhile, managers can use the field any time they like to deliver constructive feedback.The idea: by making it easy to garner more frequent feedback and generate more open conversation, employee reviews  whether annual, quarterly, or monthly  can include many more data points, presumably becoming more productivein the process.Andreessen Horowitz apparently likes the approach. It just gave Reflektive $3.5 million in seed funding in a deal led by general partner Lars Dalgaard, who earlier founded and ran the HR software company Successfactors.Going forward, says founder and CEO Rajeev Behera, Reflektives13-person team aims to build up more products that are engaging for employees, including profiles where people can update others about what theyre doing, what theyve accomplished, and what projects on which theyre working.Reflektive also plans to integrate with many more services, including Salesforce, Github, and Hubspot.We want to be where you are, says Behera, wholast worked at Disney Interactive, managing a team of roughly 80 peopleand observing firsthandlots of task management versusemployee development.Behera thinksthatby creating a far more open feedback loop, managers will be better equipped tohelp their employees careers to evolve, and employees will be more motivated to spend time with their management.More than 50 paying clientsare giving it a shot. Among Reflektivescustomers is Pinterest, Glassdoor, Lyft, Optimizely, Instacart and Thumbtack.
