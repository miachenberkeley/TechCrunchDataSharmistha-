That said, were still looking for more international startups to sign up for country pavilions at Disrupt NYs Startup Alley, so get in touch with us today to express your interest.So, why should you sign up for a country pavilion, you ask? Displaying in Startup Alley is a great way to get your product or service in front of the eyes of some of the most prominent investors, developers and enthusiasts in the tech community, folks who can help take your company to the next level.Plus, many of the TechCrunch writers and editors, as well as dozens of other members of the press will be in attendance, which could land your company the coverage it needs to make it big.CrunchBase data from Disrupt NY 2014 perhaps tell it best.
