There are tons of questions around the product itself including guesses on how Oculus will actually execute the distribution of the Rift. The original founder of the company has continued to support the original mission of the team, especially as it operates under Facebook. Managing peoples expectations are hard, but Luckey is doing a pretty damn good job of it, noting that first to market is hard:@PalmerLuckey Future advancements and high volume will make VR available to everyone eventually, but 1st gen will be mostly early adopters.

Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) December 24, 2015Without sharing the price of the Oculus Rift, Luckey is clearly intimating that Facebook being a partner will help it from suffering that $1,500+ price point that could scare the bejeesus out of anyone who isnt a current developer kit owner and worrying less overall about initial profits. The price is going to be a lot of money, and more importantly, youll be putting a lot of trust into one team. Worth it? Thats the $2B+ question.A company that has to survive on immediate hardware profit would have to hit with a much higher price  think $1000+.  Not greed, reality. Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) December 24, 2015The last tweet almost suggests that the Rift could come in under $1,000, which many consider to be the sweet spot for those already into VR as well as those who are interested in learning more and will to take a chance on the medium. Still expensive, of course.Without a doubt, 2016 is going to be a breakout year for virtual reality, but the key will be not burying it before you try itwhich at any price above free is always difficult.
