Remittances are a huge business, with $582 billiontransferredin 2015and$432billionof that sent specificallyto emerging markets, according to the World Bank. Today, one of the bigger startups in thefield has raised somefunds of its own to help it better tap theopportunity, and better rivalestablished players like Western Union and others likeWorldRemit and PayPals Xoom.Remitly  a Seattle-based remittance service co-founded and led by a former top executive from Barclays  has picked up $38.5 million in a Series C round of funding. Led by new investor Stripes Group, the round also hadparticipation fromVulcan Capital (Paul Allens investment group) as well asexisting backersDFJ, DN Capital, Bezos Expeditions (Jeff Bezos investment firm), Trilogy Equity Partners, andothers that are not being named. (Other previous investors include QED and Eric Schmidts TomorrowVentures.)The funding brings the total raised to date byRemitly to$61 million(including earlier rounds raised when Remitly originally co-founded by Oppenheimer,Josh HugandShivaas Gulatiandwas called Beamit). For some comparison,WorldRemit has raised just shy of $148 millionand is currently valued at $500 million. And TransferWise has raised just over $90 millionand is allegedly approachinga $1 billion valuation. (By the by, we have heard from more than one source that TransferWiseistrying to close another round of funding at the moment.)Matt Oppenheimer, Remitlys co-founder and CEO, says his companyis not disclosing its valuation, but we are trying to find out.but according to filings dug up by VCExperts.com, this latest investment was made at a valuation just under $170 million.First, there is Remitlys geographic focus. While companies like TransferWise have developed platforms that work on the ideaof catching as manymoney transfer opportunities as possible, Remitly has taken a different approach, building its business to target the very biggest corridors first.Up to now, the company has only focused on transfers from US dollars to three countries  India, Mexico and the Philippines  which Oppenheimer says account forthree of the top-five countries for receiving money transfers (the other two are China and Vietnam).Remitlys existingbusiness has now passed $1 billion transferred annually, and today, to coincide with the funding, Remitly is expanding itssending options to include Canada, where immigrants and others send $23 billion abroad to families each year.The other area where Remitly differs from some of its competitors is in how it works. Taking a page from Oppenheimers experience at Barclays, and understanding the fragmentation of the market  the leader, Western Union, has only 17% of the market at the moment  Remitly is trying to keep things simple, quick and cheap to stand out.It says it has a proprietary network of banks and cash pickup locations for receiving money (versus some others that use aggregated services). The platform itself  via mobile app or online is designed to transfer the money seamlessly and as fast as a few minutes if you opt for the express tier (the economytier takes 3 days).The pricing, meanwhile, undercuts Western Union fees (which start at8%): the economy service is free, while the higher tier starts at $3.99. Where it sometimes falls down is in the exchange rates. As of the time of writing, the locked-in rate for one corridor  U.S. to Philippines  is actually higher for Remitly than Western Union and Xoom.Its also made moves like acquiring a company  Talio  to improve messaging communications from within their app (tapping into the fact that services like Facebooks Messengerare becoming key platforms for people talking and subsequently sending money to each other).This is all in the name of better quality of service, Oppenheimer said.Living in Kenya and running banking there for Barclays, I could see that money transfers from abroad werea huge part of peopleslives, but also a huge problem because of the costs and infrastructure, he said. They deserve better, and Im very driven to help them.And this is also why Stripes came in as the lead investor in this round.Remitlys rapid growth in a large and well-defined hundred-year-old market is a great example of how a new generation of companies is using technology and leveraging mobile adoption to deliver better, faster, and more secure solutions to increasingly discerning consumers  all at lower costs, said Stripes Group partner Ron Shah, in a statement. By doing this, Remitly is impacting peoples lives in a significant way and were excited to join the team as they continue to expand their global footprint.Of course, there are some who aremore skeptical of Remitlys slower approach to the market. Remitly is currently the fastest-growing of the remittance players  over 400 percent in the first quarter of 2016  but its seeing a much smaller volume of transactions, which has had a knock-on effect on valuation, funding, and subsequent growth.Oppenheimer contends that this latest tranche of funding will give it more than enough room to grow and that its current growth rate is a testament to where it is going and the focused approach Remitly is using to getthere.Whatyou see is that you wouldnt have the growthrates we have if you didnt have strong repeat usage, Oppenheimer said. That sounds like something everyone couldsay but its unique to us in the industry.
