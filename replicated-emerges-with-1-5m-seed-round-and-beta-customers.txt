Replicated, a company that wants to helpSaaS vendorsship an on-premises version of their applications more easily, made a series of announcements today including a $1.5M seed round and several Beta customers.The company is taking advantage of Docker containerization technology to build asolution that enables developers to code once and ship two identical versions of the product  one that gets installed in the cloud per usual and one for customers who prefer to maintain the application in a private cloud or their own data centers.In addition, the company released a Beta of its product and announced several beta customers including Travis-CI, Code Climate and NPM. All in a good week for the nine-month old company.First the cash: the round was led byBoldStart with participationfrom Founder Collective, Mucker Capital, TenOneTen, WonderVC and WTI. In addition several well known angel investors participated including David Lee (formerly of SV Angel),Tom McInerney and GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner.Replicated is the second startupfor founders GrantMiller and Marc Campbell, who previously launchedLook.io, a mobile customer service chatapp bought by LivePerson in 2012 for an undisclosed amount of cash.After their first companywas sold Miller and Campbell worked at LivePerson for a couple of years and they observed aproblem. Big companies sometimes didntwant to use a SaaS application, but they might like what the SaaS provider was offering. Most SaaS companies dont have the resources to build a separateon-premises version and then maintain a code base for twoversions, Miller explained to TechCrunch.At the same time containerization technology from Docker and others was beginning to take off.Containers have enabled companies to create portable applications. If applications become more portable, a company like LivePerson [or anyone else] could ship a Docker image to host behind the firewall, Miller said.Withoutcontainers you would be forced tocreatea second product for customers looking foran on-premises version  and that could prove time-consuming, costly and not always successful. The container approach solved a huge problem and Miller and Campbell took advantage.Yet Replicated ismore than just a simple installation tool. Once its installed, it helps integrate with company credential systems such as Active Directory or LDAP, provides information about the instance in a dashboard, informs the user when an update is available, offers auditing tools and even backup services.Companies have foundReplicated so useful because it solved this huge problem of maintaining two code bases. Asangel funder and GitHub founder Tom Preston-Warnerwrote in his personal blog last week:At GitHub, we burned through a lot of developer cycles building our own installer (several times), securing the installation environment, coding an automated licensing management system, integrating single sign-on services (LDAP, Active Directory, CAS, etc, etc), building out a searchable audit system, supporting customer-reviewable support bundles (logs and other diagnostic output), allowing numerous backup strategies, and countless other Enterprise-specific features that were killing our Enterprise deals, Preston-Warner wrote.Replicated solves all of these issues and lets customers create an enterprise instance surprisingly fast. A demo on the company website claims it can be done in around eight minutes. Real world installations may take longer, but the point is its within in reach without a huge amount of effort.(Its worth noting that Preston-Warner is no longer with GitHub and his former company is not a Replicated customer.)Yesterdays announcement at DockerCon that the major container players would be creating an open container standard was music to Millers ears. With a standard, his company doesnt have to create tools tuned to Docker, CoreOS and others. Replicated can create one product forthe standard and it should work across all participating vendor products.Replicated is just getting started, but if it can replicate the success of its first startup, it should work out fine.
