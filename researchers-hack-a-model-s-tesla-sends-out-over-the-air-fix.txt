When it rains, it pours.After it was announced last week that cars from bothChrysler and GMhad majorsecurity vulnerabilities, two security researchers announced that they had figured out a way to take control of certain components inside Teslas flagshipModel Sline, according to the Financial Times.The hack is being demoed tomorrowat Black Hats computer security conference by Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder of the security firm Lookout, and Marc Rogers, principal security researcher at CloudFlare.After physically connecting a computer to the car via an ethernet cable,Mahaffey and Rogershad access tocertain systems in the car, and were also able to leave behind a Trojan Horse to allow for remote-access.The most notable exploit discovered by the researchers was the ability to turn off a Model S, which if going under 5 MPH, would initiate the brake and cause the car to suddenly stop. However, if turned off while traveling faster than 5 MPH, the car just switchedto neutral, leaving the ability for a driver to presumably safely navigate to the side of the road.The bright side is that both researchers have been working with Tesla for several weeks on software fixes, and today the company rolled out an OTA (over the air) update to automatically update the cars software, which willpatch these vulnerabilities.The companys method of wireless updates lets them push new softwareto theircars over Wi-Fi or cellular connection, which is still a new experiencefor the automotive industry.This method is a stark contrast to how Chrysler is handling itssecurity patch, which is shipping 1.4 million USB drives to all affectedowners. This technically means that some of Chryslers cars will still be vulnerable to remote takeover until all 1.4 million owners manually plug in the drives.As more vulnerabilitiesare discovered in car systems, expect to see automotive manufacturersplace a higher priority on things like information security and vulnerability testing.Notably,Chris Evans, former head of Googles Chrome Security team,tweetedyesterdaythat he will be joining Tesla to lead the security team.A Tesla spokesperson gave TechCrunch the following comment on the exploitand subsequent patch.Our security team works closely with the security research community to ensure that we continue to protect our systems against vulnerabilities by constantly stress-testing, validating, and updating our safeguards.Lookouts research was a result of physically being in Model S to test for vulnerabilities. Tesla has taken a number of different measures to address the effects of all six vulnerabilities surfaced. Weve already deployed and developed an update to all Model S customers through our over-the-air system for the vulnerabilities they surfaced. And, we continue to develop further ways to harden our systems, informed by ongoing discussions with the security research community, as well as our own internal analysis.
