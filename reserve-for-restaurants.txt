Since it launched in 2014, Reserve has often been described as a dining concierge  which sounds cool but alsomaybea little vague. Basically, the company combines a flexible reservation system with payments.Now Reserve is ready to do more, with the launch of something called Reserve for Restaurants. Peter Esmond, the companys head of restaurant product, described this as a table management service  an industry term for products(like those offered by OpenTable) that Esmond explained as an operational tool to manage the guest experience from beginning to end.In Reserves case, that means that in addition to just managing reservations, the system also includes a customer database, so restaurantscan keep track of someones preferences and allergies across visits, and even across restaurants in a larger group or chain.And on the reservation front, Reserve is launching a new Reserve.com so you can now make reservations on the web (not just from your smartphone), and its also offering an embeddable widget so restaurants can offer reservations on their own websites.We want to be aligned with our restaurant partners, CEO Greg Hong said. With that the alignment comes a better pricing structure  a flat fee for restaurants to use our table management product. You can have an unlimited amount of reservations and thats the same flat fee.Reserve was launched out of Expa, the startup studio whose partner Naveen Selvadurai will be speaking on-stage at Disrupt NY at 11:30am Eastern today.
