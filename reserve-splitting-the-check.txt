Reserve, a startup that helps with restaurant reservations and payments, is adding what it says has been the most-requested feature from both diners and restaurants.The app emerged from startup studio Expa. If youre trying to get a reservation, you specify the time window and party size, and the app provides you with a list of curated restaurant partners. If it cant get a reservation at the time you want, it will suggest alternatives with available tables.Then, once youre actually finished with the meal, the app also handles the payment, adding your preset tip percentage and a $5 fee for Reserve.Today the companys adding another layer to that payment, allowing users to split the bill evenly. As soon as your reservation is confirmed, you can invite other users to join the meal. You can invite people from your phone contact list, and theyll be invited to download the app if they havent already. As more users join, the check gets divided accordingly.Hopefully, this means that all the awkwardness and tedium of figuring out how to split the bill gets figured out ahead of time, rather than at the end of a nice dinner. And yes, everyone pays the same amount, so if youre going to argue about things like whether someone should pay extra when they buy an expensive steak or drink more booze than anyone else, Reserve might not be the app for you.Of course, you can still choose to coverthe whole meal yourself, say if youre taking a client out to dinner or going on a date. And if someone accepts the payment invite but ultimately cant make it, they can still back out anytime before the check is closed. (If its too late for that, well, I guess theres always Venmo.)You can read more about the new feature on the Reserve blog. You can also readabout Reserves observations on the psychology of splitting the check (like ordering a $500 bottle of wine when everyone else in your party is drinking water) on Medium.
