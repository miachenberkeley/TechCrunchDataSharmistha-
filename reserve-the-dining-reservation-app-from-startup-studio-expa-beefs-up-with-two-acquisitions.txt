Reserve, the restaurant reservation company that launched this past fall out of Garrett Camps startup studio Expa, has acquired two fellow startups in the dining space.Reserve announced today it has bought Zurvu, a New York-based startup that also deals in online restaurant reservations, and HAIL, a Santa Monica-based startup that makes an app for splitting the check with a group of diners. In a blog post published this morning about the deals, Reserve CEO Greg Hong wrote:Both zurvu and HAIL share Reserves hospitality-focused approach and care deeply about making the dining experience better for both diners and restaurants. Together, we all look forward to bringing the Reserve experience to more restaurants and guests, and making every part of the dining experience even better, from making a reservation all the way through to paying the check.Financial terms of the acquisitions have not been disclosed. Both Zurvu and HAIL launched their apps to the public about a year ago, and LinkedIn lists their employee counts at 5 and 2, respectively. Reserve has raised a total of $17.2 million in funding to date, and Expa itself has some $50 million in its coffers.It sounds like positive news for all three companies. And at a wider level, its also nice to see some consolidation in the increasingly crowded world of restaurant reservation apps.Additionally, another of Expas startups, Operator, is still in stealth, but today Josh Constine reported details on how it can purportedly fetch users whatever they want with just an instant message.
