If you reserved a Signature Series Model X, the $132,000 version of Teslas new crossover SUV,you can start modifying it to your hearts delight.Earlier today, thecompany began opening up the ordering process, enabling early adopters to pick out their interior and exterior colors, and to throwall kinds of add-ons into their respective shopping carts, including a $1,000 subzero weather package that includes washer nozzle heaters and a $750 towing package.All versions come with those amazing falcon rear doors, seating for seven, and proximity sensors that prevent thevehiclesfrom coming into contact with other cars(not to mention ceilings).Thanks to a 90kWh battery pack, all are expected to rocket from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds, too, though you can pay $10,000 more for a Ludicrous Speed package that shaves off another .6seconds.Thats faster than a stock Porsche 911, the company would like you to know.Less expensive models are expected to start at around $75,000, the same base price as the companys Model S  though as any Model Sowner will tell you, you sort of have to run up your bill with add-ons if you want to enjoy any real degree of comfort.Tesla first announced the Model X back more than three years ago,and it began taking reservations for the car immediately. In fact, bulk production was expected to start last year, but we forgive you, Elon Musk, for flubbing that projection.

The Model X isdriven onstage at around the 14:10 mark.)After launching the car  the company has said that deliveries will start this month  Teslaplans to turn its attention to a more affordable line of cars called the Model 3, due out in 2017.
