Reuters has joined Bloomberg, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in being blocked in China.Reuters itself reported that its website isnot reachable in the country as of today.The organizationsaid it has suffered partial censorship in China in the past, but this timeits English and Chinesesites are both affected. Thats verified bydata from internet monitoring site Great Fire.Reuters is committed to practicing fair and accurate journalism worldwide. We recognize the great importance of news about China to all our customers, and we hope that our sites will be restored in China soon, Reuters said in a statement.The reason for the block is not clear. Chinas internet censorship organ often blocks new sites and services without warning, but in cases of media it oftenfollows controversialstories. That was the case for past restrictions imposedon The Guardian, New York Timesand Bloomberg each of which published political exposes prior to being blocked. HoweverReuters hasnt recently put outstories that obviously raise red flags or cover sensitive topics.Reuters joins WSJ, NYT, Bloomberg in the blocked-by-China club. Who's left? Anyone besides FT?

The organizationis beingserved2.6 billion requests per hour, thatshoicked thehosting fees up to $30,000 per day, prompting it to go public with a pleafor help.The perpetrator of the attack has not been identified, but the incident comes days after a Wall Street Journal storyexplained how Great Fire is using cloud storage systems to bypass Chinas censorship regime. You can draw your own conclusions from that.
