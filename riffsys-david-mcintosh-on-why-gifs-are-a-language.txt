Riffsy CEO David McIntosh doesnt think GIFsare a novelty  he thinks theyre the harbinger of a new form of communicating emotion over the Internet.The beauty of GIFsis if someone texts you whats up, you might send back hey, Im ok and people might think somethings wrong, McIntosh says. Or you can send back a GIF, fundamentally the beauty is it extracts some particular emotion youre feeling thats bundled in a 3 to 5 second moment.Riffsy adds a keyboard for users that allows them to search for and copy GIFs that they can then paste in messaging apps.Recently, Riffsy unveiled a new feature that allows users to add captions to GIFs. The trick is finding a daily use case  and Riffsy measures the companys success by how short a session time is (how long it takes to find a gif) and how many times a user is using the keyboard.Ultimately they arent looking to browse, theyre only gonna look at those 4 to 8 [GIFs], and if you dont deliver something in the first 4 to 8 [GIFs],they wont want to share, he said.Theres a technical aspect to the problem as well: Riffsy has to ensure that the GIFsthat show up on the keyboard are optimized for messaging platforms. That involves figuring out how to optimize video elements, making it easier to share those GIFs in a lightweight  and fast  manner.If it all works, that gives Riffsy more data as to what GIFs people are looking for at the right moment. That then turns into a positive feedback loop: the faster it is, the more likely people are to use it, and the more likely they give Riffsy more data that helps it improve the speed and accuracy of the GIFs it serves.Riffsy of course isnt the only one working in the space  there are competitors like PopKey. But McIntosh says Riffsys been able to hold their position while other competitors sometimes see a spike in popularity but have some problems maintaining their status on the App Store. Hes notentirely far off, but to be sure Riffsy hasnt really breached the top spots of the overall App Store itself. Still, its usually ranked among the top utility apps.Heres the ranking chart for PopKey:And heres Riffsys:McIntosh says Riffsy isnt a keyboard company exclusively, as it working with a lot of partners like Fleksy, Kik and Facebook Messenger. All this it would seem, taken together, makes Riffsy more of a video company trying to make GIFsone of the core ways we communicate in the future more than anything else.We think of ourselves as building this visual language, this lexicon, McIntosh says.Were building this visual expression language.What were finding is that people love sharing GIFson mobile because theyre a fast, fun way of communicating.
