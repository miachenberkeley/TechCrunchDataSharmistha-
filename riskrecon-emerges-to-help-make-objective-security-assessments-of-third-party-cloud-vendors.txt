RiskRecon, a startupthat helps companies make objective security assessments of third-party cloud vendors, emerged from stealth today with a $3 million seed round led by General Catalyst. Several unnamed private investors also participated in the round.Jeff Martin of TD Bank Group was also named to the companys board today.RiskRecon leverages information that is available on the web from companies operating there as part of the act of doing business. If you stand up web servers and DNS servers, these are intentionally discoverable because they are providing services on the internet.Systems reveal the software being run and version information from which you can determine security performance, Kelly White, RiskRecon CEO and co-founder told TechCrunch.RiskRecon can harvest that information, then measure and observe the vendors security posture, giving each company an objective security score  something companies tend to struggle with when evaluating cloud vendors.Security teams are currently well armed with personnel and tools and data in their own enterprises, but largely blind to the security and reliabilityof third parties, Whitesaid.RiskRecondoes more than provide a simple score though. It also offersdetailed actionable information whensecurity gaps are found, so customers can work with the vendorto help them adhere to the security requirements.When DeepakJeevankumar, principal at General Catalyst did his due diligence prior to funding RiskRecon he found the companywas attacking a problem without manysolutions, and thats something his firm looks forwhen evaluating companies to fund.When he talked to CISOs (chief information security officers), he consistently heard that they had a budget for a servicelike this, but there were not enough viable solutions. When he combined that with the experience of the founders, initial validation from early customers and the potential to grow it led to investingin RiskRecon.While White wouldnt go into any great detail, he did hint that there is more to the platform than the initial security scorecard service, and he has plans toleverage the technology in the future to measure other types of things.While there are other companies competing in the space, Jeevankumar said the most common methodwas trying to manually figure out a companys security position, an approach thats not sustainableas companies are using ever-more cloud services and need a way to assess the security risk with each one quickly and reliably.RiskRecon is still in early dayswith10 employees. Ithas paying customers, although it wouldnt reveal how many at this point.
