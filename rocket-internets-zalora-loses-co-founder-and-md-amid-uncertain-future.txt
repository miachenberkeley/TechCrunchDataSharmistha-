Zalora, the fashion-focused e-commerce site backed by Rocket Internet, has lost two topexecutives.Singapore-based managing directorsHarry Markl, who isalso listed as a co-founder, andAvni Pundirhave departed the company, TechCrunch understands.The company, like others in the Rocket Internet portfolio, has a fairly unorthodox executive structure with five joint managing directors overseeing the business over the past few years. Markl and Pundirsexitsindicateunrest andleavethe remaining management stretched and under-experienced in some areas,sources inside Zaloratold us.Markls final day was last Friday, while Pundir  a long-time fashion retail exec who previouslyworked in the U.S., France and India  quietly left over a month ago to pursue her own business. (Markl and PundirsLinkedIn profiles still list both intheir Zalora roles.)Markl is said to be weighing up starting his own company, but multiple sources inside Zalora told TechCrunch that his exit was triggered by ongoing tension with Global Fashion Group (GFG), the umbrella company Rocket Internet set up to manage its fashion e-commerce sites across the world, including Zalora.We contacted Markl but he declined to comment.GFG, which raised $35 million last year at a $3 billion valuation, is run by former Amazon France headRomain Voog and it is comprised of five companies:Dafiti (Latin America), Jabong (India), Lamoda (Russia and CIS), Namshi(Middle East) and Zalora. All in all, it claims to reach23 countries worldwide.A source inside Zalora told us that while GFG provides benefits, such as financing  Zalora isnot about to run out of money, as had been speculated, with GFG as its parent there is disagreementonits approach to markets. Zalora executives, were told, view Southeast Asia as a long game that can be won, but GFGs management team ismore inclined to focus onmarkets that canreturn their investment faster  such as the Middle East, where Namshi is showing promise.That provides some context as to why Zalora is selling off its business units in Thailand and Vietnam for a relatively paltry$10 million a piece, as we reported last week.GFG considered them too nascent and, with TechCrunch understanding that there are plenty of suitors offering to take both businesses off their hands, the parent has decided to sell.That runs against some of the managements belief that Zalora is on the cusp of breaking through.We are 1/3rd of Zalando in terms of traffic, we are 1/15th in terms of revenues,Markl wrote to Zalora staffin a leaving memo obtained by TechCrunch. Hence, we have a lot of potential to grow and as a result we/you should aspire Zalora to be a 1bn EUR company in the next 2-3 years.Rocket Internets latest financial resultsshowZaloras revenue rose 78 percent to208 million ($234 million) in 2015, but its net loss increased36 percent to93.5 million ($105 million.) Its current valuation is unclear since it is part of GFG.Zalora is currently run by Group CEO Michele Ferrarioand (another) MD Tito Costa.(Magnus Grimeland, the fifth long-standing Zalora exec alongside those two, Markl and Punir, moved over to GFG  Rocket Internet is quite the management circus at times.) But Markls exit, first announced internally in late 2015, has seen a string of high-ranking employees follow him out of the door, including former CFO Cooper McGuire,who is now at Ensogo and Zalora Singapore head Dione Song.Zalora isn unlikelyto landa mega investment deal like Lazada, its $1.5 billion-valued Rocket Internet sibling, which ran landed $500 million from Alibaba last week.But, we hearthat the outlook is comparatively rosy thanks to high margins and the security of GFG. However, with changes at the top and some country units for sale, theres a sense of uncertainty at the company. That could apply to investors, who put over$200 million into Zaloras coffers, too.Lazadas backers got modest returns for their money, and its even less clear what those who bought into Zalora can expect.
