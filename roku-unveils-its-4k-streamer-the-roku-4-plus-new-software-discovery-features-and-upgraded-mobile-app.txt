In whats been the worst-kept secret thanks to a number of leaks, including photographsof the new player, streaming media devicemaker Roku is at last officially announcing the launch of its latest product, the Roku 4. The updated hardware is nowdesigned to support both 4K Ultra HD and HD TVs, and includes a faster processor, better Wi-Fi, more memory, optical audio out, and more.Notably, it will also run Rokus upgraded operating system, Roku OS 7, which is focused on helping users discover and follow their favorite content across Rokus more than 3,000 apps and channels.Also new today is an updated Roku mobile app featuring a refreshed design that makes it easier for customers to use Rokus features, including Search, the Roku Feed and remote control functionality, right from their smartphones.ProsConsThe Roku 4s launch is a significant one in the rapidly heating-up connected player market, where companies including Apple, Google, Amazon, TiVo and others offertheir own streaming media devices  sometimes several  for consumers to choose from, ranging from low-cost dongles like Chromecast or Fire TV Stick to higher-end players like the newly refreshed Apple TV.Amazon recently even upped the stakes even more, by banning sales of Apple TV and Chromecast from its site. And TiVo just rolled out a new streaming player and DVR called TiVo BOLT, which is designed for 4K video and offers a clevercommercial-skipping feature.But for a number of consumers, Rokus position as an independent third party trying to support all the popular streaming services, even niche offerings, has been its biggest advantage.So when it came time to upgrade its player, the company focused on hardware improvements that would support newer 4K TVs, combined with software upgrades that would help make finding 4K content, and other things, easier than before.In terms of the device itself, the new Roku 4 has a wider footprint to make room for its upgraded internals, which include a faster quad-core processor, improved Wi-Fi, a new audio port, additional memory, and more.The box has seen a sizable increase in RAM, as well. Roku did confirm the specs previously being circulated online which had pointed to 1.5 GB of RAM for Roku 4 versus the 512 MB in Roku 3. (The specs were pulled from a developers guide that was briefly available via Roku.com before being pulled down. Roku wasnt planning onoffering a full hardware spec list, however.)Meanwhile, the playersupports the usual collection of inputs and outputs including HDMI, USB, Micro SD, and Ethernet, buthas now added Optical Audio Out, which will allow users to plug their Rokus into their stereo systems or sound bars. (For those who need this option, this is an advantage over Amazons new 4K Fire TV, which recently dropped support for optical.)Also new is the Remote Finder button. By pressing a button on the top of the Roku 4 box, the remote will beep to help you dig it up from where its buried in your couch cushions. You can also customize the sounds this feature uses.A reset button on the bottom of the device, also previously spotted via the FCC filing, is also now available.In addition, many of Rokus other features have carried over to the new product, including itsremote control that offers a headphone jack for private listening and motion control for casual gaming.But for the end user, what these improvedcomponents translate to is an overall improved experience on the Roku. That starts with a crisper, clearer user interface thats been upgraded to 1080p, as well as support for up to 4K Ultra HD.When we say 4K we mean full 60 frames per second, explains Lloyd Klarke, Rokus director of product management. We mean full support for HDCP 2.2, which is the security protocol that makes sure 4K stays true all the way through.Its 4K done right.Of course, Roku 4works with standard HD as well, though consumers not planning to upgrade to a 4Ktelevision any time soon may find fewer reasons to run out and purchase the pricier ($129.99 MSRP) player.The Roku OS 7 software update both complements the hardware improvements by making it easier for those with 4K TVs to actually find 4K videos, but it alsointroduces a number of other new ways to find and follow content from Rokus growing selection of channels.While the company previouslyrolled outfeatureslike universal search and the Roku Feed, which helps you track movies coming soon, the new OS expands the ability to follow content to go beyond movies toalso include the ability to find and follow favorite TV shows, actors and directors.When new content arrives, users are notified right on their My Feed section on the homescreen, which also now shows the number of new updates waiting for you.Sharad Sundaresan, Rokussenior vice presidentof product management, tells usthis feature has been smartly designed so it doesnt inundate your feed each time you have a new update. Instead, things are grouped together, when appropriate  like when there are multiple episodes of a show youre tracking, for example. In that case, these wouldall be grouped as a single update, not several. (Review units are not available until later this month, so we cant speak to promised functionality vs. real-world results at this point, however.)This will be especially helpful in the growing world of cord-cutting where people follow programs they like, not the network or service it lives on. The addition isalso competitive, to some extent, with TiVos OnePass feature, which aims to make it easier to track favorite programs across services.More importantly, perhaps, in light of Roku 4s support for 4K TVs, are a number of new features designed to surface 4K video.For starters, theres now a 4K row in the Channel Store which will highlight all the channels Roku offers that support 4K, including Netflix, M-Go, Amazon Instant Video, YouTube, VUDU, and ToonGoogles. Thats a larger lineup than other streaming players have at launch, it should be noted.Theres also a curated 4K Spotlight channel exclusive to Roku 4 on users homescreens that includes a selection of TV shows, movies, clips and more. There are even 4K themes and screen savers which let users customize their Roku with scenic pictures and other images, and then pair those with matching Remote Finder sounds like Star Trek, kittens, Zen and more.Though the new software will ship on Roku 4, all of Rokus current players from 2011 and on will alsobe able to install the update when it arrives in mid to late October.Alongside the launch of the Roku 4 and Roku OS 7, the Roku iOS and Android app is getting an overhaul, too. The interface has been improved to better control the Roku from your mobile device, including the ability to interact with key features like Roku Search, Roku Feed, Remote Control and Play.In the new app, users can access Voice Search, view and add items to their Roku Feed, launch Play on Roku to see their own photos and videos on their TV  even zooming in on the photos on the phone to see the same on the television screen  and more.4K customers can use the updated app to create their own personalized screen savers that will play when the player is idle.Another newfeature is the ability for Roku 4 to connect to special Wi-Fi networks  like those found in hotel rooms and sometimes dorms, where authentication is required. Now users will be able to connect using their mobile or desktop browser, which will help those who travel with their Roku as well as college students who want to use a Roku in the dorm.The currentapp works when youre on the same network as your Roku, butSundaresan says support for an untethered experience is arriving in the new version.You can take the Roku app and use it anywhere you want without being close to a Roku, he says. So if youre out at lunch and somebody tells you of a great TV show, you can quickly open your Roku mobile app and tap follow and add that show to the list of things youre following.While the app itself appears to offer a better design  even if its still quite purple  the platform as a whole doesnt offer a smart assistant like Apples Siri, for example, to aid with voice searches. As this is still a relatively new additionfor streaming devices for now, its less of a reason to forgo a Roku if youre happy with itsother features, but the omission could become more troublesome over time. (Perhaps Microsoft should license Cortana to Roku?)The updated mobile app (iOS and Android) will roll out at the same time as the new player, in mid-October, and the untethered feature will ship soon after.The device is available for pre-order starting today at www.roku.comfor $129.99.
