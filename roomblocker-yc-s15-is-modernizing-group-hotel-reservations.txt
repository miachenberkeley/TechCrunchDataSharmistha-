If youve ever had to reservea block of hotel rooms for a conference or wedding, you know how complicated the process can be.YC-Backed Roomblocker is a service thathandles the entire group booking process, from gathering bids to acceptingreservations for people in the group.Heres how Roomblocker works: First, the companyassigns each group organizer to a dedicated concierge, who walks them through the entire booking process.The concierge willinvite a selected group of pre-approved hotels to submit bids and concessions (things like free wireless or room upgrades), which will all be presented to organizers in an online dashboard.Having a Roomblocker concierge negotiatingfor the groupmeans that they willtypically obtain better pricing and concessionsthen they would booking on their own.The organizer then chooses ahotel, and Roomblocker creates a group reservation page where guests reservetheir rooms online. While seemingly a simple feature, having a custom reservations page for guests is extremely helpful for group organizers, whonormally are stuck tracking down each guestto obtain booking information.Now organizers get access to a dashboard with a live rooming list, inventory of available rooms, and automated reminders forguests to reserve their rooms.Roomblocker is completely free for groups to use. The company generates revenue by takinga commission from hotels for bookings made through the platform. Founded by ex-Salesforcers Dave Yen and Michael Wang, the companys early customers include Salesforce and Dropbox,as well as a heavy percentage of weddings and personal trips.According to the company,25 percent of all hotel reservations belong to a room block, and group hotel bookings arenow a $137 billion market worldwide. Roomblockeris aiming to capture the vastmajority of this market, as the company can arrange room blocks of anywhere from tens to hundred of rooms per night.Yen andWang explained that a bigpriority is improving the customer experience by modernizing the traditionally outdated group booking process. For example, most hotels require faxed signatures pages, which Roomblocker now provides to the group organizer in a e-signature format. The company also plans to eventually handle payments from guests, a feature requested by both hotels and group organizers.
