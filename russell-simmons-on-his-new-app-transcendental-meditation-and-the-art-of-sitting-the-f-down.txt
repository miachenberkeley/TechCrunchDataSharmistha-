Russell Simmons cuts a striking figure in the world of music. Intellectual, yet down to earth. A mogul, yet not pompous. Innovative from his early days, his connection with his past is evident when he speaks. I findhis connection with yoga and transcendental meditation even moreinteresting.His new appwhich goeslivetodayis little more than an audio book companion to his most recent book titled Success Through Stillness: Meditation Made Simple. Howeverit fits aspart of his strategy for making his meditation message available to more people in more channels. The proceeds from his books go to various charities.I can see how the appmight be useful as a primer for people trying to get into transcendental meditation (sometimes referred to as TM) and it may be useful to hear a persons voice while you are trying to go to through the motions and procedures (instead of reading and then trying and then reading and then trying, etc.)However it makes me wonder if technology and meditation can coexist orif technology is a distraction from the state to which TM tries to get you?I spoke with Simmons and asked him this question and a few others as we discussed his newappandhis vision for transcendental meditation.
