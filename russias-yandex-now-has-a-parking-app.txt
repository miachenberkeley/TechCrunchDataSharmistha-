Russias search and Internet services giant Yandex has launched a parking app for iOS and Android, called Yandex.Parking  initially in Moscow where traffic congestion (in)famously makes parkinga particular headache.As well as helping driverslocate a free space, the applets thempay to park, and pay only for the specific time they have been parked  refunding any overspend if they leave before their ticket has expired.The app launchfollows Yandexsacquisition of a low-powered mobile geo-location startup KitLocate,last March.The latters technology had previously been used to power a street parking and payment service, with its geo-fencing algorithms used to identify when a driver had vacated a space in order to trigger an alert to stop an in-app parking meter tocalculate the exact parking fee. Yandex is evidently using the same tech now in its own brand parking app play.Yandexsapp displays unoccupied municipal and commercial parking spaces on a map view,with vacant spacedataupdated every 10-15 minutes (with the data provided by Moscows Parking Space Administration  so its not a real-time representation of parking capacity).Parking fees are also detailed in the app. And users of another Yandex service, its sat-nav offeringYandex. Navigator, can tap a button to be routedto a spare spot once theyve considered their parking options.Multiple payment methods are supported by the app, including the companysown online payment system, Yandex.Moneyorbankcard payment, orvia a mobile phone or a city parking account.Yandex notes that payments fromcity parking accounts are commission-free; other methodsentailvarying commissions. Update: Yandex has specified it is not currently taking any cut itself on parking payments, so pushing users to its online payments and sat-nav services arethe likelydrivers here, along with general digital brand expansion.Yandexhas beenincreasingly rolling into new areasin recent years, as a strategyto carve out growth beyondits core search business  which has amajority but relatively stable marketshare in Russia. Hence the imperative to diversify out from search services.Yandex does not break out the number of active users of theYandex.Money servicebut says more than 20 million e-wallets had beenregistered as of the end of 2014. And more than 12,000 new wallets arebeing registered daily.
