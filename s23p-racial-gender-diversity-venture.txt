Chamath Palihapitiya, the opinionated venture capitalistwho once got into a public spat with Ron Conway over income inequality and challenged founders to have the courage to move to Oakland a few weeks ago, has catalogued detailed racial and gender diversity data on venture firms throughout Silicon Valley in a report withthe subscription technology news site,The Information.Palihapitiyas firm Social + Capitaland The Information pulled data on 71 firms representing more than $160 billion in assets under management and broke out the racial and gender mix of the investment leadership. This distinction is key because many firms have women or minorities, but they might be in non-investing roles likemarketing or HR. Women, for example, make up 60 percent of non-investing roles at venture firms in the survey, but only 8 percent of the senior investment team. (You can go through the entire dataset here.)Palihapitiya said he was motivated to do this because if the big tech companies and startups like Slack start takingdiversity more seriously, so should the firms and investors funding them.In an op-ed entitled, Bros funding Bros: How to Not Change the World One Delivery Service At A Time, he wrote:We need a wake up call on Sand Hill Road. We need to recapture our potential and open the doors. Invite more people into the decision making: young people, Blacks, Latinos, females, LGBT and others who arent necessarily part of the obvious majority. Surround ourselves with a more diverse set of experiences and maybe we will prioritize a more diverse set of things. Maybe we will find more courage to do the hard things.Indeed, the diversity conversation that started when Google finally divulgedits own data in May 2014 after it and several other major technology companies includingApple, Oracle and Yahoo resisted publicly reporting itunder federal lawfor many years, isnt necessarily about numbers.It is a much more fundamental conversation about what the future of American society should look like and who should be shaping it.If a handful ofpredominantlywhite men isbuilding or hand-picking the technology companies that touch hundreds of millions or billions of customers around the world, what defaults are embedded into theseproducts and business models that further entrench inequity?It becomes a morepressingquestion as the technology industry moves from purely software-based companies toward businesses that touch and allocate finiteresources in the real world like in labor, transit, land-use, real estate, health care and education  where equity is a majorconcern forpublic policy makers.Below is the overall breakdown of gender and racial diversity of venture firms:Then, here are the most diverse firms based on the racial and gender make-upof the investment leadership:Then, here are the firms withoutwomen or minorities in investment leadership positions:Social + Capitalthen calculated a quantitative ranking of all of the venture firms, based on their gender and racial diversity and split out by the total amountof assets under management.For firms with more than $1 billion in under management,Palihapitiya came out on top. For mid-size firms, Y Combinator came out in the top positions followed by Formation 8. For firms with less than $250 million under management, the top firm was Floodgate and then CowboyVentures.Social + Capitals mathematical formula weighted racial diversity evenly between white, black, Latino and Asian people, and didntbreak out any special emphasisfor underrepresented minorities.In general, white- and Asian-Americans are overrepresentedin both large technology companies and in the venture world relative to their share of the U.S. population. The Social + Capital formulas choice would beacomplicated one either way, given the Model Minority narrativethat cloudsthe story ofAsian-American immigration.What does Palihapitiya want firms and the public to do with the data?Its largely up to them, he said.VC Diversity Final Exhibits by Kim-Mai CutlerVC Diversity Methodology Write-up VFinal by Kim-Mai Cutler
