Its looking like 2015 will be a big year for Indias music streaming space. A weekafter Rdios arrival in the country, Saavn  a New York/India startup that was among the first to cater to India ispushing its credentials after hiring former Google India executiveand startup figureMahesh Narayananas itsCOO.Thats not all, however, Saavn has revealed that it has 11 million monthly active users  thats the first time that the company has gone public on its userbase in two years. Back in February 2013,itclaimed10.5 million active users, but that was during Facebooks viral heyday when a number of services rode high withinflated user numbers generatedby the social network, only to watch their figures(and businesses) crash as Facebookssocial algorithm was altered to decrease virality.This time the numbers are for real, Saavn CEO and co-founderRishi Malhotra told TechCrunch in an interview.[Those figures] were [released] almost before companies knew what stats meant. Facebook brought a lot of people into the registration funnel [but] where weve arrived at now is definitive systems to see how many people touched the product each month, he explained.Activity-wise, four-year-old Saavn is approaching 200 million streams per month, afterthe volume of streaming increased three-fold duringthe past twelve months.Malhotra said that Saavn saw 30 million people use its service in 2014. Last year also marked the first timeAndroid overtook iOS on download figures  according to the Google Play Store, Saavn for Android has between 10-50 million downloads.Saavn claimed that the number of users paying for its Pro service increased 6X in 2014, butMalhotra did not disclose how many are paying versus using the ad-support free version.The Saavn CEO did reveal that 70 percent of Saavns usage comesfrom inside India, while 90 percent of streaming is onmobile devices.Thats an incredible data that Malhotra puts down to Saavns popularity in India, a mobile first market. Togive an idea of how high that mobile rate is, Spotify just revealed that it sees 52 percent of streaming from mobile devices. Saavn is on the next level.Malhotra said he believes that Saavn is on track to reach 100 million users over the next few years and, with that in mind, the company has broughtNarayanan on to move things forward, particularly on the advertising side of its business.Narayanan spent over seven years with Google India in two separate stints, which included time asthe head of its mobile ad business in India. He believes now is the time for mobile entertainment services to surge in the country.The smartphone story is real in India. Ive been talking about it since 2008/2009. At that time, people would literally laugh at the idea of streaming music  but, today, if you look at the growth there are already 100 millionusers of Facebook, which shows what is possible, he said.Narayanan seems to have a golden touch, too. Three of his previousstartups have been acquired, with two of those deals happening just 12 months after his arrival  Sociomanticto Dunnhumby/Tesco, and AdMob to Google.Does that mean Saavn has one year until it will be acquired?Malhotra andNarayanan both laugh at the question, and insist that they are just starting out on an ambitious plan, but it isnt hard to see how Saavn could appeal to potential suitors.Rdio become the first major global service to enter India, but the writing was on the wall when it bought Saavns rival Dhingana last year. Dhingana was soldafter it shut down following the loss ofkeydistribution deals, but Saavn isnt struggling and doesnt appear to bedesperate to sell which gives it more leverage.Saavn raised a new round of funding last year, but it has never disclosed the value of its investments from venture capitalists.Rdio was keen to stress its 32 million song catalogue, and position itself as a hybrid international-Indian service. Saavn offers three million songs from India and overseas, butMalhotra stressedthat other factorsare of greaterconcern.The competition is really YouTube and piracy, he said.Its really good to have streaming competitors in the market it shows there is demand and people are listening to music.[But] we have a lot of confidence in the base we have, in some cases well beat the number of YouTube streams fora particular song., for example.Rdio CEO Anthony Bay told TechCrunch last week that he believes the companys free internet radio service will be a major driver thatappeals to many people in India who wouldnt ordinarily consider music streaming.WhileMalhotra declined to comment too directly on the rival business, he voiced his belief that newly released music is key in India, and services like Saavns free tier (which is feature-full but ad-supported) workbetter thanshuffle-based radio services like Rdios free offering.Around 70 percent of the market is new release-driven, and we feel weve built one of the strongest offerings.Were basing our service on fouryears of data in building our product, and that gives us a sizable advantage on how to build our product and company, he said.With Australia-based Guvera, Line-owned Mixradio not to mentiondomestic services Gaana.com and Hungama.com completing thecompetition inIndias music streaming landscape, it will be fascinating to see how things develop this year.Indias startup scene in general has attracted increased attention from overseas  with Yahoo, Facebook, and (most recently) Twitter making their first acquisitions in the country over the last year. With smartphone adoption growing faster in India than any other country in Asia Pacific, the addressable market for consumer startups is increasingrapidly.Music has always been a key part of the phone experience  even with MP3s or FM radios on feature phones  and, coupled with surging smartphone sales, services like Saavn could see some serious growth in users this year. That could mean intense interest from potential suitors  such as Spotify  that are yet to enter India.
