Its challengingfor a fast-growing small business to offergreatcustomer service while continuing to increase sales at a rapid rate. It would probably go more smoothly if the two departments hadaccess to a common set of information, but making that happen for a small business has been a difficult and expensive undertaking.Salesforce.com wants to change that and today it introduced an integrated product combining Salesforce IQ CRM and Desk.com customer service  its tools aimed at small businesses. By integrating the two, sales and service reps can get a full picture of the client across multiple channels, something that has previously only been available to much larger business using enterprise software thats way out of reach of most small business owners.What this means is that sales reps working in SalesforceIQ can see notes and interactions that customer service had with the customer and CSRs working in Desk.com can see the buying history of the customer.Desk.com with SalesforceIQ info embedded.The integration itself is freeandwill be included withDesk.comPro and Business Plus Editions and with SalesforceIQ Growth and Business Plans. These plans arent cheap, butBrent Leary, co-founder and partner at CRM Essentialssays certainSMBs cant afford to ignore this.I think the high-growth, fast-growth SMBs who need to scale quickly while maintaining, and in some cases enhancing customer relationships will have no choice but to get it, he said.Whats more, Leary has done research with Social Media Today on what they call The Social Customer Service Index and theyve found that sharing information from customer service across the organization becomesincreasinglycrucial as a small business begins to scale.This years study found that companies whichhad a structured process for sharing service insights with other parts of the business (sales, marketing, product development, etc.) were way more likely to see a very positive impact on company goals and objectives in terms of customer engagement, Leary explained.Its possible for a small business to start with Desk.com if they are more oriented toward customer service or SalesforceIQ if they are more sales-centric, but Leary says if the business begins to growquickly, it becomes usefulto integrate them.Managing retention while accelerating the uptake of new customers is a tough balancing act, and will only get tougher without these kinds of integrations in place, hesaid.The trick is balancing these rapidly growing sales with theability toservice alargerbody of customers, which becomes especially challenging the faster you grow.The ones who plan for that [growth] up front, even though they may emphasize one aspect more in the beginning, will be the ones successfully handling their growth in a way that will keep current customers happy while they bring on new ones [onboard] at an accelerated rate, he said.If you have both products, turning on the integration is as simple as going to the Admin panel of each and turning on the Sharing switch.This integrationis available today to all qualified customers.
