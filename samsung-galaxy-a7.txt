Last year Samsung released an eight-core version of the Galaxy S5, and now it has outed a dedicated octocore smartphone in its own right: the Galaxy A7.Korean firm teased the phone in 2014and showcased it last week, according to a report, butnow it is official with dual 1.8GHz and 1.3GHz quad-core processors (or 1.5GHz and 1.0GHz in the dual-SIM version) and a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Those eight cores are great for handling multiple tasks, on paper, and are backed up with16GB of memory storage, 2GB of RAM and a large2,600mAh battery.Theres no word on launch dates, initial markets or pricing, although reports last week pegged it at around $420 off contract.The phone runs Android KitKat and sportsa 5.5-inch screen, making it larger than the Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A7 that were announced back in October.Like those two products, it isanother slim, metallic bodied release from Samsung, which has long been criticized for using all-plastic bodies, including faux leather.Samsung has again focused on appealing to cameraphone enthusiasts.There is a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. On the software side, the Galaxy A7 software that Samsung claims can take a wide selfie, while auto selfie lets narcissists snap themselves using a voice command or even a simple wave of the hand  selfie sticks be damned.Samsung is also toutingAlways Clear Voice Auto Control which reduces background noise in-call, multiple screen support for apps and a private mode that adds an extra layer of security for important files and documents.The introduction of the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7 over the past few months is interesting:Samsung is diversifying its focus beyond its flagshipGalaxy S and Note families.The company is bracing itself for its first profit drop in three years, andits latest Galaxy S5 and Note 4 dont appear to be selling as well as previous models.The Galaxy A3 and A7 were pretty focused on China, as we noted last year, but Samsung isbirthing a new series of phones that offer something else to consumers. With a distinctly different design, marketing focus and lower prices, the Galaxy A series looks to be its Xiaomi-like effort at bringing a quality experience to the mid-range of the smartphone market.
