If you didnt pre-order the new consumer version of Samsung Gear VR, you might have some difficulty finding it on your favorite online shopping destinations.Amazon and Best Buy, both places that have been touted as having a supply of the virtual reality accessory, are showing temporarily out of stock and sold out online messages respectively.Amazon:Best Buy:The best bet seems to be buying it right from Samsungs site, where you can get one-day delivery if youre not a patient person (like me).Ive reached out to Samsung and Oculus for comment and will update once I hear back. Neither company made it clear how many devices would be available once they went on sale yesterday, so Im not ready to call them scarce just yet.UPDATE: A Samsung spokesperson provided us with the following statement:We are delighted with the overwhelmingly positive response Gear VR has received from reviewers and eager buyers alike. We are working hard to fulfill all orders as quickly as possible.Is it for you? Check out our review:
