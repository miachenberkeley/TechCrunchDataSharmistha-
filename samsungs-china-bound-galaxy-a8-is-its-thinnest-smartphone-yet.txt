Samsung has quietly launched its sveltestsmartphone to dateafter theGalaxy A8was announced in China today. At just 5.9mm thick, it bests the Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A3, Samsungs previouslyleanest phones, on the thinness front and keeps the design fromits older siblings.The all-metal device, first spotted by Engadget, has decent specs but is more of a mid-ranger than a high-end device that might challenge the iPhone or Samsungs own flagships.Beyond the 5.7-inch 1080p OLED display, theres an eight-core Snapdragon 615 processor, 16-megapixel/five-megapixel back and front cameras and 2GB RAM. The 3,050 mAh battery is notable for being larger than that of the Galaxy S6, all the while keeping to a compact form factor and impressively light 151g in weight.While Samsung launched the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge earlier this year and its flagship phablet  the Galaxy Note 5  is expected to arrive on the scene soon, mid-range devices like the Galaxy A8 are important for its business, since Xiaomi is eating Samsungs lunchin China with its $150 Redmi and $300 Mi 4 phones. The aforementioned Galaxy A5 and A3 were also initially focused on China, so  once again  its quite clear thatSamsung is putting significantfocus on the worlds largest smartphone market, where share of shipments dropped by a whopping 50 percent this pastyear.It isnt clear whether the Galaxy A8 will get an overseas launch. The Galaxy A5 and A3 did, so it may well present itself in time, but  either way  the consistent design language of these devices is something that were likely to see in other devices targeted at international customers.
