With the Samsung Gear VR hitting shelves and faces all over the place last week, the company ran a new commercial to promote it this weekend. I saw it during the 49ers vs. Seahawks game.Its.
Surprisingly.
Good.I say surprisingly because even we found out how difficult it was to show the potential of VR through a video during our review.After speaking with some folks in the virtual reality community after Gear VRs launch, it seems like Samsung has positioned its phone accessory nicely. The commercial is a part of Samsungs campaign called Its Not a Phone, Its a Galaxy.Have a look:Most importantly, its not nerdy. Sure, its still a long shot that Samsung can entice enough people to buy one of its phones to power the $99 Gear VR, but a commercial like this is going to help get kids of all ages (my adult friends basically) to start asking for it as a Holiday gift now.
