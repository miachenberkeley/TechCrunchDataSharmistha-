Samsung worries about your child. Are they sleeping well? Do they miss you when youre away on business? Can they put on a VR headset without their parents help? That last one is pretty important. Because Samsung wants your kids to experience the joy of VR just before bed instead of a regular bedtime story even though why would you do that?First, let me say in all seriousness, though, that any work by a tech company focused on connecting kids and parents should be encouraged. Its good that they saw a problem  kids missing their mom or dad  and thought, wouldnt it be cool if? Good on them for that.But there are a few things here that  and maybe Im just out of touch  kind of bother me about this.For one thing, weve all been warned about staring at LCDs right before bed. It can mess with your sleep, or so the theory goes. For that matter, bedtime stories are supposed to be a relaxing, wind-down time  the sound of a parents voice droning on about journeys in and out of days, the familiarity of the story and imagery. A dynamic, interactive 360-degree virtual environment seems like the total opposite of that, and a pretty poor bedtime activity.On top of that, there is very little in the way of studies of how VR and early childhood interact. Im guessing five minutes a day isnt going to rewire any kids brain, but I am not a medical doctor. This just feels like one of those things that, for now, theres no reason to take the risk on.Also, and this is just tangential, but why isnt dad or other mom reading a story to the kid? Isnt that a solution too? Maybe with a video call to mom that shows her actual face and not a big plush lump? Maybe that happens afterwards, but Im just saying!VR is really happening, and I feel confident that parents and teachers are going to find ways to integrate it positively into their kids lives. But this particular application seems a little forced and premature.
