A recent poll suggested that the majority of Americans support the FBIand its order to open the iPhone used by San Bernardino shooterSyed Rizwan Farook.While some of those voices may be less aware of the specifics of the situation, Apple has the backing of the husband of one of the survivors of the terrorist attack, which left14 people dead and 22 others seriously injured, after he changed his mind over the case.Salihin Kondoker, whose wifeAnies Kondoker was shot three times inthe attack but avoided the main hall after taking a trip to the bathroom, filed a friend of the court briefsiding with Apple in its dispute with the FBI, as BuzzFeed first reported. Writing in a letter toJudge Sheri Pym,Kondoker, Kondoker explains how his opinion on the case turned when he delved deeper into the longer term implications of the FBIs order.When I first learned Apple was opposing the order I was frustrated that it would be yet another roadblock. But as I read more about their case, I have come to understand that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people. I share their fear, he writes.Kondoker also makesthe point that shooterSyed FarooksiPhone was owned and operated by the County of San Bernardino. That was standard andcommon knowledge among all employees, he says, including his wife who did not use use [her phone] for personal communication.Why then would someone store vital contacts related to an attack on a phone they knew the county had access to. They destroyed their personal phones after the attack. And I believe they did that for a reason,Kondoker says.Tim Cookpreviously called the FBIs request to develop software to grant access to the data on the device chilling. In a lengthy interviewlast week, Cook lamented the potential for such a backdoor to get into the wrong hands and cause damage to hundreds of millions of people.We have no sympathy for terrorists, Cook said. Were not protecting their privacy, were protecting the rights and public safety of everyone elseDeveloping that software, its so powerful it has the capability to unlock other iPhones. That is the issue.In a earlier editorial, FBI Director James Comey saidthe FBI isnt out to create a backdoor or ongoing access to iPhones. Apple claimsit has provided all of the user data that it has on file forFarook, butComey suggestedthat the FBI has a duty to leave no stone unturned in its search for information.Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesnt. But we cant look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we dont follow this lead, he wrote in legal blog LawFare.BuzzFeed has a full copy ofSalihin Kondokers letter here.
