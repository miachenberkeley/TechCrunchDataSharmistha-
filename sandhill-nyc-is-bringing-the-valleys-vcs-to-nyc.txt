Calling all New York startups: starting next month, Silicon Valleys iconicSandhill Road will be coming to you.Launching today, Sandhill.nyc is program organized by seed stage NYC fundFundersGuild to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and the Big Apple.Startups do these quick trips out to the Valley where they have 20 meetings over two days, jumping from firm to firm just saying hi, says FundersGuilds Josef Feldman. You get this concentration of VCs in one area so you can optimize your time and efficiency.For better or for worse, the New York startup scene is not so organized. So why not gather the citys beststartupsin oneplace and handleall of the logisticsso that the only thing VCs have to do is show up? (If this doesnt get more Valley money flowing into NYC startups, I dont know what will.)FundersGuildis working with a handful of co-working spaces and startup networks in New York, such as WeWork and Techstars, to spread the word about the program to local companies. Founders can apply on the Sandhill.nyc site, and the group will curate a list of companies for VCs to choose from before they fly out.Its all self-funded, and free for everyone, says Feldman. Were just doing it as a way to bolster the tech community.Theprogram will run through the month of October, and participating firms include Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed, CRV, Crosslink Capital and many more.
