Scanadu, a health tech startup working on devices that can scan and upload medical-grade diagnostic tests to a smartphone, has raised $35 million in Series B financing.The round was led by Chinese investment firms Fosun International and Tencent Holdings Limited, with participation from China Broadband Capital and Iglobe Partners of Singapore, as well as previousinvestors Relay Ventures, Redmile Group, Ame Cloud Ventures and Three Leaf Ventures. This now brings the total funding amount up to $49.7 million.Scanadu came out of the X Prize FoundationsQualcomm Tricorder competition, but soon broke an Indiegogo record, raising more than $1.6 million in less than a month for the Scout, a medical device that could check for heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.The startup out of the NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California has since started shipping the more than 8,000 orders for the Scout and has created another device called Scanaflo, which is essentially a pee stick that can detect things like blood in urine, pregnancy and STDs when the information is uploaded to your smartphone.Scanadu is working with the FDA to get full approval for thesedevices and has so far been given the green light to test them out on individuals as investigational devices.The new funding will help the startup further push these devices out in the market for testing and continue on the path to FDA approval as a hand-held medical device for commercial use.We continue to build out our family of products and move down the path to regulatory clearance in the U.S. and China, Scanadu co-founder Walter De Brouwer said. Scanadus mission has always been to give eight billion people access to quality healthcare via their smartphones.We went to Scanadus headquarters not too long ago to check out what the team was up to.
