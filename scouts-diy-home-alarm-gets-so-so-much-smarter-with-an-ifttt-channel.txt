Im really digging Scouts install-it-yourself modular home alarm.It has its quirks, but its a massive step toward everything I want in a security system. I can add new components easily, I can control everything from my phone, theres no ridiculous contracts or hidden fees, and its all wireless.Today, Scout gets even better  and so, so much smarter. Thanks to a brand new IFTTT channel, it can now interact with everything from your phone to your Jawbone Up, and from Google Docs to Facebook.In case youre unfamiliar: IFTTT stands for If This, Then That, and it acts as a super-simplified middle man for making Internet-connected services and things work together. It takes input from one service, and produces an action somewhere else.Want Dropbox to automatically download every Facebook photo youre tagged in? Want an alert on your phone if its going to rain tomorrow? Want your crazy smart lightbulb to flash every time someone tweets at you? IFTTT can do all of it, and makes it insanely simple.Ive been using the Scout Alarm IFTTT channel for the last 24 hours in a private beta, and I already feel like the system has instantly become vastly more powerful and Im just tapping the surface of what it can do.Heres some of what Ive done, none of which would have been possible without todays integration:Each of these things took all of a minute each to implement, because thats just how IFTTT works.Another idea I just came up with while writing this, but havent tested yet: my neighborhood has a Facebook Group. IFTTT has a Facebook Group channel. With a few clicks, my security alarm could automatically post to the neighborhood Facebook Group when its triggered. Hey guys  my alarm seems to be going off. Please look out your window and see if you spot anyone running from my house with a TV under their arm. Thanks!You can find Scouts new IFTTT channel over here.
