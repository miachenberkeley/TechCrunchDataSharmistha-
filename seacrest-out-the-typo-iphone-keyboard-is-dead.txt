BlackBerry has successfully ended the short but dazzling life of Typo, the hardware keyboard for iPhone spearheaded by longtime BlackBerry user and iPhone switcher Ryan Seacrest. In a short press release announcing a settlement, BlackBerry notes that according to the terms of the agreement between itself and Typo, the latter company will stop selling any kind of keyboard for devices with a screen size smaller than 7.9 inches.That means theoretically, a future Typo keyboard accessory could adapt to fit a huge iPhone 8 Plus Plus or something if Apple goes crazy, but for now its curtains for those wanting to have their modern smartphone software ecosystem and type on it, too.
