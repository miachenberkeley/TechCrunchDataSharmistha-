Ticket sales startup SeatGeek is the latest company joining the move to paperless tickets.Thanks to a new feature, when you buy a ticket on SeatGeek, youll no longer have to print out a PDF or (shudder) wait for someone to put your physical tickets in the mail. Instead, the tickets will be delivered through the app, giving you a mobile barcode that will be scanned when you reach the venue.Co-founder Jack Groetzinger said this type of mobile ticketing is live with around 85 percent of the venues on SeatGeek. Those venues were probably moving in this direction already, since the SeatGeek tickets are takingadvantage of their existing hardware.He also predicted that paperless tickets willhelp eliminate one of the more annoying parts of the process, namely standing outside stadium, waiting for your friends to arrive so you can give them their tickets. Butto really get rid of those moments, SeatGeek will also need a ticket-sharing feature  something the company says its working on.As you can see in the chart below, SeatGeek has already seen a dramatic shift to digital tickets. Groetzinger acknowledged that some people still think of a classic, hard-stock ticket and think, Thats what a ticket looks like, but in hisview, thats just nostalgia. (Or, to put it more bluntly, Frankly, its kind of bullshit.)Sure, fans might still want hard stock tickets for special events like the Super Bowl, but in his view, by-and-large theyre going to disappear.
