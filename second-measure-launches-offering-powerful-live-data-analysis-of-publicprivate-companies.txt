Atestament to the strengthof Second Measure (YC S15) and their data analysis product is the fact that, after backing the company, Y Combinator was so impressed that they became paid users of the product themselves and are now using itto help inform their own future investments.Second Measuredelivers such effective analysis byinspecting billions of credit card transactions (more than 1 percent of all U.S. consumer spending) and presenting detailed insights to investors and analysts through their products.We can see pretty much real-time performance of public and private companies, said Mike Babineau, co-founder of Second Measure. For example, we can show an investor how many subscribers Netflix had this month or how Uber is doing relative to Lyft.Second Measure has two products: a web application that they are targeting more towards analysts and a data feed that they make available to researchers. The company currently tracks about 400 companies, but is looking to soon expand to thousands.The data, which the company receives from a variety of strategic partners (they declined to get more specific), appears incredibly rich and allows for deep comparative analysis.As a note on the privacy front, co-founder Lillian Chou specified that all of the credit card data is stripped of identifying informationwhen Second Measure receives it.A sample of Uber ride-sharing data from Second Measure.Babineau and Chou showed me a demo of the product, comparing a couple of ride-sharing companies, and the analysis presented by the web application seemed pretty game-changing (check out some of the Uber data on this companyblog post).Through Second Measure, investors can dig throughoperational metrics like revenue and customer growth, retention and cohort analysis, while alsobenchmarking companies against their competitorstotrack overall market penetration.The company is focusing its offering primarily towards VCs and hedge funds, according to Babineau, and its pretty easy to see why the product would be attractive to them.Right now, venture capitalists are primarily scouringSecond Measures product to identify fast-growing companies, andhedge funds are usingit to inform their financial models and anticipate the earnings releases of public companies.Babineau and Chou believe that many otherinvestors just arent utilizing the available complex pools of data to effectively inform their decisions, largely because of limits in access.There are all of these new and interesting large-scale data sets out there that are really valuable, Babineau said. But these investors arent in a position to use them because they dont have data or engineering teams, thats where Second Measure is really trying to bridge the gap.
