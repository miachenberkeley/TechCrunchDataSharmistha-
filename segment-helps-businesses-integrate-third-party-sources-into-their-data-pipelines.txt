Segment helps developersmanage all the analytics data their apps and services generate. Besidesfanning out this information to analytics services like Google Analytics and Mixpanel, or marketing tools like Marketo, all this datalands in a data warehouse.At best, though, all this informationonly shows an incomplete view of a customers journey from landing page to purchase. Starting today, Segment users will also be able to combine their internally generated data withdata from third-party tools like Salesforce, Zendesk, Stripe, Twilio and others  data that is typically siloed and hard to integrate (support for Google AdWords, Facebook Ads and other tools is coming soon).With this new tool, called Sources, developers willbe able to create tools and dashboards that show a far more complete story of how users interact with a company. Say you want to know how your SendGrid campaign converted. You can now combine data from your email campaign with analytics data from your apps and Stripe to see how well they performed (using the customers email address as the identifier).One of Segments first beta customers for this service was Instacart. With Sources, were gathering vital new insights about our customer experience, said Che Horder, Director of Analytics at Instacart. For example, by combining Zendesk with purchase data, we can analyze how interactions with our Customer Happiness team affect conversion, sales, and long-term retention. We have a much clearer understanding of our funnel, whats working, and the impact of our support team on revenue.As Segment co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt told me, users simply must use a standard OAuth workflow to add these new sources to their existing Segment accounts. The company slightly modified thepricing structure for its warehouse plans to include support for up to three additional data sources for a fixed fee.He also noted that while most users will probably combine this data with an existing business intelligence service to build dashboards, the company itself has no plans to add any of these services itself.
