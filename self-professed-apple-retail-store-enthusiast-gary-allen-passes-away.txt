One of the things that I worry about the most is not having a hobbya healthy passion to immerse myself in. Sure, I love technology, but its also my job. Gary Allen, a self-professed Apple Retail Store Enthusiast, passed away Sunday at age 67 after a fight with brain cancer, according to a report by the Washington Post. An interesting point that WaPo points out is that Allen wasnt a fan of Apples products as much as he was of where they were sold to the public.His bio on Twitter says it all: Apple retail store enthusiast, traveling to celebrate the grand opening of new stores anywhere on earth.The word fanboy gets thrown around a lot in the tech world, but Allen probably knew more about Apples retail maneuvers than most employees at Apple. His website, which is down today, ifoapplestore.com, was all about Apples newest stores. Hed also travel to most of the stores to experience them himself.A smart person told me once that something is not a work of art until it has admirers. Admirers like Allen lend credence to the fact that Steve Jobs wanted Apples stores to be inviting, elegant and a place worth seeking out.Hard to generalize, but Apple store sizes have changed over the years. Big to small, back to big. pic.twitter.com/pkqxfj8eoU Gary Allen (@ifostore) February 22, 2015Apple's new method of attaching glass stair treads minimizes hardware.
