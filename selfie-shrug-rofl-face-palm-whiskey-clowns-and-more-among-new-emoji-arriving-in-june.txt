More diverse emoji.Unicode had already rolled out an update thatincludes a skin tone modifier, but it still features a lot of male characters in job and sports roles  something where it would be nice to at least choose from a man or a woman.Other companies are also working to diversify their emoji. Facebook this week introduced new emoji to better reflect skin tones and gender, along with more emoji of females  including as a police officer, runner, surfer, pedestrian, and a swimmer. Google employees, meanwhile, have submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium asking them to add 13 new emoji that highlight the diversity of womens careers, featuring women working as doctors, scientists, in the technology industry and more.However, before you get your hopes up too much about all these new characters: although the Unicode Consortium will approvethese new emoji in the Unicode 9.0 on June 21, 2016, that doesnt mean thats when theyll arrive in emoji keyboard on your phone.After that point, smartphone makers like Apple, Google and Microsoft can use add the new emoji into their own software. They then have to release that to the public via a software update.Main image: mock-up from Emojipedia; remaining from Unicode.org
