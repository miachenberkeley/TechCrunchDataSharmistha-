If youre like me, youve been sitting here, counting the hours until CES is over so you canget back to non-CES business next Monday(T minus five hours). Beyond CES, its been for all intents and purposes a harrowing, tragic week for the news business (Je suis Charlie).Awkward CES selfie stick images like the one above are a particularly small hairball in this weeks heinous media enchilada, but annoying nonetheless. In many ways tech brings us together (#JesuisCharlie), in other ways it makes us even more isolated, more removed from our fellow humans. And it can also make us look like dorks.As much as I love technology, Ive never seen someone use a selfie stick in the wild without laughing inside. If you need a picture of yourself (or your behind) taken so badly, so immediately, why dont you simply ask another person to do it?Thats what we did back in the day, before the proliferation of selfie sticks, before hotels started handing them out for free like umbrellas and vendors at the Colosseumand the Eiffeltower added them to their roster, in addition to fractal versions of the monuments themselves and $4 water. Before Beyonc used one in a music video. Before they were a gleam in some Japanese inventors eye.I know its asking a lot of you dear readers, but next time you consider whipping out a selfie stick, please save me and the general publics secondhand embarrassment and just ask someone else to take your photo.(If youre afraid someone will steal your phone, approach someone who looks like you can take them )You might make a new friend, or meet the love of your life. I mean, who knows, you might even land a portrait by Mark Zuckerberg?The aliens saw all your selfie sticks, turned to each other and said lets just wait out the invasion, planet is doomed anyways Jonathan Lally (@jonathanlally) January 9, 2015
