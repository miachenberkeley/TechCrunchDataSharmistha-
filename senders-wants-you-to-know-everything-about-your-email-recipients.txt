The advent of email tracking has caused quite a bit of a ruckus, and is generally creepy.A NY-based startup called One More Company made anattempt to tacklethis head-on with a service called Trackbuster, but now theyre interested in something else: enhancing emails by adding relevant and contextual info.Called Senders, theemail service createsa sort of contact card withinemails, including social networks, a short bio, photo, company address and other relevant info. Thus, performing searches on the person(s) within your emails can be easier, if not rendered moot, since Senders will fetchand catalog most of the publicly available information for you  all within theemail correspondence.An example of Senders working on the first try, withmy own corporate email address can be seen below:For those concerned about personalinformation that would become too easily available within the card, there is a way to stay elusive: a user can edit the information that Senders will display. By verifying youremail, you canmake editsto the card. For my own, I added more relevantinformation while also making some corrections  like using my own Twitter account and not the sites. Best of all, the reverse can be done where details within the card can be whittled down to almost none.Senders is currently in open beta and accepting sign-ups now, so potential userscan see whether or not its useful for daily emailing.
