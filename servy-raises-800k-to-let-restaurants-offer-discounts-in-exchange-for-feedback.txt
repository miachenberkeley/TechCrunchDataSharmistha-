Servy, an app that lets restaurants offer a partial discount in exchange for private feedback, hasjust closed $800K in seed funding.Investors include RiverPark Ventures, Beacon Fund, Food-X, DreamIt Ventures, and Nick Kenner, CEO and Founder of Just Salad.Most online restaurant reviews are either written because of a fantastic or awful experience. Either way, these reviews live online forever, and normally dont actually contain constructivefeedbackfor the restaurant.Servys platform solvesthis issue by allowingrestaurants tocustomize their own surveys, which are kept private between the reviewer and the restaurant.In exchange for their feedback, reviewers are offered anywhere from 5%  75% offthe price of their meal.The company hasan algorithm that uses demand to determine howmuch reimbursement is offered to diners.Robert Edell and Julien Wormser, co-founders of Servy, explained that a popular restaurant may only offer a five percent discountfor a review, while an establishment with low demand may offer to cover most of the meal.This dynamic percentageis also important because it allowsServy toprice evaluationsat a point where restaurants are still able to make a profit.This means restaurants can afford to conduct a much greater amount of reviews than if they used a traditional secret shopper service, which can cost hundreds of dollarsper review.The companyis currently in 80 restaurants and chains in NYC,andwill use the funding to continue itsnationwide expansion.
