A competitiveSeries A roundis an equity round where a company generally raises greater than $5 million led by a top-quartile venture capital firm.During theseSeriesA rounds, it is not uncommon for founders to receive multiple term sheets from lead investors at different valuations, and to feel uncertain about how to come to the correct valuationfor the company.The cause for this confusion is that VCvaluationprocesses are often a black box, where there is no industry standard methodology for calculatingvaluationof seed toSeriesA startups. Some investors suggest that their valuations are a function of users, revenues, market potential or other forms of company traction, while others cite comparable deals as the primary justification forvaluation.There are VC firms that attempt to use the VC Method, but the VC Method breaks down when dealing with very early stage startups that often have little financial data and few comparable companies.Finally, some investors admit that they are pulling the number from the sky, or are simply willing to pay more than other investors to win the deal. Generally, thevaluationrange results in the group of Series A investors taking 15-25 percentof the company.Although there is no industry standard methodology for calculating SeriesA valuations, the reality is that arbitrarily accepting (orsetting) aSeriesAvaluationcan do more damage than good for a companys future funding or exit opportunities. If thevaluationyou choose is much lower than the intrinsic value of the startup, it can cause you to give up too great a share of your company.Alternatively, if thevaluationis too high, you may face a down round at yourSeries B. Savvy founders are aware of the risk of an incorrectlypriced SeriesAround, and are often in search of a reasonable framework for estimating therightprice for their Series A. This article attempts to provide that framework.My partner and I at 645 Ventures work closely with our seed-stage founders to help them raisecompetitiveSeriesA rounds. As part of this process, we help our founders think through establishing therightvaluationrange for their company, which we sometimes refer to as the market-efficient price of theround. We have not developed a magic formula that computes valuations given specific inputs.Every early stage startup is different, and there are so many distinct attributes of a companys value that such a formula would have too many parameters to be meaningful. Instead of using a silver bullet formula, we focus on determining thevaluationthat is a reflection of the milestones reached by the startup team, while at the same time reflects reasonable foreseeable future performance.It is important to note that the market-efficient price leaves room to raise future rounds at realistic highervaluationranges, is low enough to make a future acquisition possible for therightacquirer and is rewarding for the startup team and its employees. To get to therightprice there often is a trade-off between how much capital the company needs and how much equity the team is willing to give up.We encourage founders to initially think of the value of their startups based on five categories: market threat or expansion, the teams alpha, intellectual property, product stage and growth rate (the most commonly applied rationale).Below is a graph that shows a general set of Series A valuation ranges, demonstrating how these factors can impact pre-money valuations. Below the graph is greater detail on market, IP and growth impact onvaluation.Note: SuperSeriesA rounds are relatively new, having emerged around 2012. They are indicative of a more exuberant market, where large seedroundsizes have expanded to what was previously the average SeriesAroundsize, and the largestSeriesAroundsizes have expanded to what was previously the average size of growth rounds (i.e., Oscar, Compass, Jet, Maple, GitHub, etc.). SuperSeriesA rounds are generally started by above-average founders with significant social, entrepreneurial and sometimes political influence.When a new company has built a product or service that undeniably threatens large incumbents, we find that there is often a correlation between the companysSeriesAvaluationand competitors balance sheets, market capitalizations and trading multiples.We define an undeniable threat as a teams demonstrated ability to build products/services that are rapidly stealing market share from large incumbents because the new product is significantly better, faster or cheaper.If the new companys growth continues, then the incumbent can be in danger of losing substantial market share. This can be the case in either consumer or B2B markets. When threatened by a new company, incumbents can respond by acquiring their competitor and expanding their own market position.For example, think back to Facebook (incumbent) versus Instagram or Snapchat. Facebook is the largest social network on the planet, as well as the largest photo-sharing site on the web. Both Instagram and Snapchat threatened Facebooks core value proposition, and both did it on mobile, the most important platform that Facebook had not yet dominated. These threats contributed to Facebooks acquisition of Instagram and to its attempted acquisition of Snapchat.Because ofFacebooks large balance sheet, the market threat (and corresponding expansion opportunity) posed by Instagram and Snapchat positively impacted theirvaluationpotential. If you assumed Facebook would spend up to 1 percent of its future market cap (now valued at $274 billion) to protect its market position, then we could assume Facebook would be willing to pay multiple billion of dollars to eliminate its most significant threats.In valuing these companies at theSeriesA, both prospective investors and founders would have taken into account future potential acquisition value.Another consideration is to assume that both current customers/users and future customers/users have value that can be monetized. In cases of non-revenue-generating companies, valuation can be calculated by the revenue per user of the incumbent ratio discounted by 20 percent or more due to required multiple expansion at exit and uncertainty of future startup growth.For B2B or revenue-generating companies, applying the trading multiples (i.e., TEV/Rev) of the incumbent to foreseeable growth targets, then applying similar discount rates, is a good method for calculatingvaluation.If you are a founder, proving your company is a market threat (or an expansion opportunity) for an incumbent and receiving an acquisition offer usually makes your company far more desirable in the eyes of an investor.At the same time, if youre lucky enough to be in this scenario, be careful not to overvalue your company, especially when compared against an acquisition offer. An acquisition offer is certainly a great benchmark; however, founders should not over-leverage that demand to drive up theSeriesAvaluation. Make sure your price is consistent with purchasing power of acquirers, and leave room for subsequent up rounds.Differentiated intellectual property with mass commercial application and broad market demand is difficult to come by in the world of Internet and software startups. However, when a team owns such IP, has a well-defined product roadmap and has significant excitement from early adopters, that company may be in a position to influence the creation of a new market or product category.The risk of product adoption is uncertain for nascent markets; however, the opportunity for differentiated IP to create a new market category can outweigh adoption risk. Both startup founders and investors have to swing for the fences in this case. This scenario can lead tocompetitivevaluations when the founding team has theright skills, timing and investment runway.Recently, this type of IP has appeared in the form of hardware (i.e., Internet of Things/connected devices), open-source technology with defensible communities and advanced software algorithms, including computer vision, machine learning, natural language process and security. What makes businesses with these categories of IP so valuable is that they can be difficult to replicate.With regard tovaluation, differentiated IP can give early stage companies avaluationpremium above what growth and/or market threat can provide. A teams ability to build real IP and high-complexity software with mass commercial appeal creates confidence in the defensibility and value of a startup.Recent examples of proprietary IP driving upvaluationare Nest (market expansion), Oculus Rift (new market creation) and Elastic Search (market enabling and open source).Unfortunately, the majority of companies cannot be valued based on undeniable evidence that the company is market-threatening, or that the company has IP that can create a new product category. Therefore, most startups rely on the future promise of building something transformative combined with historical evidence of growth.Evidence of growth usually takes the form of demonstrated engagement, such as user growth and retention, talent acquisition and execution ability. How growth metrics impact valuations can also vary based on industry and customer segmentation: consumer versus enterprise, online marketplacesversus direct sales, etc.For each industry and customer segmentation, great founders establish a set of, and track, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are indicative of demand, adoption, profitability and scale.Its important to note that foreseeable and projected growth are key drivers of generating term sheet interest, and not purely a basis forvaluation. The goal is to get investors so excited about the promise of your company that you get term sheets from investors who have been involved with similar success stories.ReceivingSeriesA term sheets from these types of investors helps founders setcompetitivevaluations. Once thiscompetitiveposition is established, then growth numbers can help justify the valuation that isrightfor the startup. Below are a couple of examples.When you start discussing revenue with investors, be aware that this discussion will likely prompt additional questions. The questions that inevitably follow a revenue discussion pertain to customer lifetime value (CLV), customer acquisition costs (CAC), margins and churn.Great investors will determine whether revenue growth is sustainable, as well as whether unit economics are sound, thus driving underlying profitability. If founders prove their company has a sound economic model and growth in a large or expanding market, thenvaluationcan be based on a multiple of projected revenue over foreseeable runway. For most revenue-generating early stage software companies, Enterprise Value to Revenue (EV/Revenue) can be an appropriate multiple.In low-margin businesses, which include transaction-based startups, marketplaces, affiliate networks, etc., Enterprise Value to Net Revenue (EV/ Net Revenue) is a better indicator. Most importantly forcompetitiveSeriesA rounds, there are oftenrevenue thresholds that must be seriously considered: $1 million+ ARR for enterprise deals, $10 million+ for marketplaces and $1 million+ of pre-orders for direct consumer products.For pre-revenue companies with user-growth figures, a total number of downloads greater than 1 million can be a good starting point for a VC conversation. However, whats more important than absolute user growth are engagement numbers: viral coefficients, transactions processed per day, Daily/Monthly Active Users (D/MAUs), data generated per day or month, cohort performance, average time on the platform, etc.These numbers help founders tell a ready scale story. These companies are difficult to value, but using theCompetitiveSeriesA Pre-moneyValuationGuide can help direct thevaluation.While there isnt one way to value a company, these are some of the techniques we share with our founders when working with them to pricecompetitiveSeriesA rounds. The exercise of valuing your company will leave you more prepared to understand the terms you receive from lead investors, and armed with information with which to negotiate terms.The beauty of startup finance is that it is an art and a science, so thevaluationmethods you use should give you avaluation range. Closing the deal ultimately requires a delicate balance of new investors ownership interests and existing shareholders perception of value and growth expectations.
