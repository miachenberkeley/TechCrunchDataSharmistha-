If youve ever tried to share a Twitter account with your team, you probably already know it sucks.You can share the password, but then you get that one guy who leaves the password on a post-it on his laptop lid and the account gets hacked. Or someone leaves, and now 15 people all need to learn the new password.You can use a third-party solution, but then youre trusting yet another third party to not go out of business, not get acquired and shut down, not go down during business hours, and, most notably, not be awful for its own reasons.In the 10 years since Twitters launch, its never gotten around to building its own fix  until now.Like a number of Twitters power-user-focused features, the new Team tool is built into TweetDeck as opposed to the more standard Twitter client.Heres how to start using it:One catch: all contributing users/admins must also be using TweetDeck.
