Agrowing number of e-commerce businesses todayareassisting their customers over SMS and mobile messaging. There are even SMS-basedservices, like Magic, Operator, GoButler, and others targeting the emergingconversational shoppingmarket. Now, e-commerce platform Shopify is aiming to help its merchants better serve their customers via mobilemessaging with the launch of a dedicated iOS keyboard appcalled Shopkey that offers instant access to their product catalog.The company is currently dubbing Shopkey an experiment, and rightly so  this more casual sort of interaction between shopper and merchant is new to both parties. Many online shoppers still think the only way to reach a merchant is via phone or email, if not in person.The Shopkey app is carving out an interesting niche in the App Store. While weve seen a number of iOS keyboard apps for consumers who want an easier way to send GIFs or want to theme their keyboard usingcrazy colors, those apps focused on a niche business crowd are still few and far between.That being said, Shopify today has a sizable user base to pitch its keyboard app to  the company has over 200,000 merchants, and the company tells TechCrunch these tend to be primarily iOS users. Thats why it launched Shopkey on iOS first, as it often does with other mobile app releases.After installation, Shopkey will allow merchants to search across their entire product catalog right from their smartphones keyboard, then send links to products along with product photos to customers via any messaging app theyre using.That means merchantscan communicate with and sell to their customers on any platform that makes sense for their business  SMS/iMessage, or native messaging apps like Whatsapp, Messenger, Hangouts, or WeChat, for example.Of course, merchantscould also use the app to more easilypost links and photos to social media sites as well, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest.The links lead to the merchants online store, powered by Shopify, which is mobile-optimized for easy checkout on smartphones.Being able to serve a mobile audience is more important than ever for online merchants, as the channel continues to see rapid growth. Case in point: mobile shopping grew by 47 percent this past holiday season, whereas the year prior, it was up only 25 percent.This growth is a combination of factors  consumers are more comfortable shopping on their phones, and retailers have adapted to consumers need with mobile-friendly websites and apps along with streamlined checkout flows.Shopkey isnt Shopifys only recent effort in the m-commerce space, however. The company also recently launched an app called Sello that lets anyone create an online store from their phone.Shopkey is live now on iTunes as a free download.
