Laundrapp, one of a plethora of on-demand laundry startups targeting London and other cities in the U.K., has acquired rival Washbox.Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, so its notclearif this represents a successfulexit for the young startupor its investors, which include the U.K. pre-seed acceleratorIgnite.Its my understanding, however, that this was an all-cash deal and that it actually closed last month.Either way,the on-demand laundry and dry cleaning space iscertainly ripe for some consolidation. Aside from Laundrapp and Washbox, other Uber-styled on-demand laundry apps operating in the U.K. includeZipJet (founded by Rocket Internet, the ruthless startup factory and e-commerce behemoth),Lavanda, andSpyn(backed byTelefonicasWayra accelerator).Theres alsoihateironing.com, which partners with local dry cleaners who handle collection and delivery, but under the ihateironing brand, andLaundryRepublic, which operates a 24-hour locker-based laundry and dry cleaning service, negating the need for a customer to be home for pickup and delivery.In the official announcement of Laundrapps acquisition of Washbox, the latters CEO and co-founder Danny Vaughton says the company is thrilled to be part of the Laundrapp family, but concedes that it was a tough decision to sell.Laundrapp is a worthy leader in this emerging market and were thrilled to have played a part in its journey, he adds.Notice the past tense? Only one of Washboxs four founders and team, James Parker (former Washbox COO), is staying on as part of the acquisition. The Washbox app will also be shuttering and its customers invited to download and transition to the Laundrapp app shortly.Meanwhile, Dominic Perks, Chairman of Laundrapp, says in a statement: Were re-inventing an industry untouched by digital and now leading the inevitable consolidation in the on-demand sector. Comparisons with Uber and talk of another British unicorn are of course exciting but our team are firmly focused on delighting customers.Did he say unicorn? I nearly just spat tea on my freshly dry-cleaned shirt.
