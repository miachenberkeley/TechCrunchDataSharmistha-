In just a few weeks, Shypco-founder and CEO Kevin Gibbon will join us at Disrupt to chat about the evolution of on-demand services and the impact easier returns could have on e-commerce as a whole.When I first met Gibbon, the startup provided on-demand shipping for a portion of San Francisco and operated out of a tiny garagein SOMA.Outbound packages to carriers were delineated by strips of tape on the ground. Every single box was processed by hand by employees working at a desk set up like one of the Operators in The Matrix, as the small team was still figuring out which steps could be automated.Just over a year later, Shyp now offers service in San Francisco, Miami, New York, and soon, Los Angeles. After an experimental partnership with Banana Republic to handle the retailers holiday returns for select locations, the startup has built returns into the app on both iOS and Android, saving you a trip to the carrier and the hassle of figuring out what kind of box and insurance you might need if a purchase from a variety of e-commerce sites doesnt work out.Oh yeah, and we hear theyve raised $50 million to ramp up expansion.Were looking forward to chatting with Gibbon about how on-demand logistics could do for e-commerce as a whole what Warby Parkers return policy did for its sales: increase orders overall by reducing the pain that comes with returning the purchases you dont like. Well also discuss best practices for adapting a startup that depends on timely deliveries for vastly different urban environments.Kevin Gibbon will join other notable Disrupt NY speakers, including Foursquares Dennis Crowley, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, and Vines Jason Mante.The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center.
