Shyp, an app that enables customers to summon a courier and ship an item, has hiredFoursquares Varun Shetty to run the companys business development operations.Shettys primary focus for now will be building relationships with retailers with the companys returns product.Customers can summon a Shyp courier to return a product through a dedicated interface in the app, a feature which launched in March earlier this year. Shyp users pay a $5 fee in order to return a product they ordered through an online retailer like Amazon.The story starts with a direct message Shetty received from Shyp head of product Wes Donohoe on Twitter after he wrote a tweet about using the product. At Foursquare, Shetty handled the companys partnerships and data licensing  such as its integrations with Uber and Twitter.Ihad a bunch of sweaters, I had to get rid of them  they were sitting in my living room for a long time and I needed to send them to my little brother, Shetty said.People were talking about Shyp, and it felt like the right way to ship something. They saw my tweet and they reached out.Shetty willbe looking toworkwith old school retailers, he said, giving examples like Bloomingdales and Nordstrom. But the companys goal is also to work with tech-augmented startups that are more like Bonobos and Trunk Club. Shyp is currently working with Rent The Runway, powering itsreturns experience in the markets whereShyp is currently available.All of that is important to the consumer, we want to build a way to make the customerexperience [for returns] seamless, he said. Its part of the product now, but Im looking to come in and get a footing withretailers and build a use case out for our users.Shettyis in San Francisco for the next month or so, and then will be based in New York  which makes sense given that many of the companies that Shyp is looking to work with are based there.
