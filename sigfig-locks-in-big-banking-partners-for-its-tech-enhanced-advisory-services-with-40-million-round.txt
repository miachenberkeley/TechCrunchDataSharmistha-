SigFig, the developer of tech-enabledfinancial advisory services products, has raised $40 million from the ventureinvestment arms of a slew of big banks.The new round is a testament to the companys belief that partnering with large financial institutions is the best way to get better financial advisory tools into the hands of the investors who need them, according to chief executive Michael Sha.Financial services firms are big spenders on technology already, but typically theyre spending on infrastructure and back-end systems rather than on customer-facing tools, says Sha.What theyre missing is access to the right kind of technology, Sha says. As well as the engineers who are really good at building a customer experience.Apparently some big banks agreed with Shas assessment to the tune of a $33 million equity and $7 million debt round of funding.Participants in the new round include Santander InnoVentures, UBS, Eaton Vance and New York Life. Previous investors Union Square Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, DCM, and NYCA Partners also put up cashin the latest round. Meanwhile, Comerica Bank gave SigFig a $7 million debt facility.Through the companys direct asset management platform, SigFig manages a pretty paltry $100 million. But the real business, says Sha, is in the services it provides to financial services firms. He was mum about how much the company manages through those deals, but said that revenue for the company is still based on a calculation of assets under management.SigFig differentiates itself from asset management competitors like WealthFront and Betterment by billing itself as more of a full service shop for the financial services firms that still manage the bulk of Americas wealth.The idea is not that were building technology that is algorithmic money management, Sha says. Theres CRM, client tools, and money management, through the SigFig platform.This investment follows an earlier announcement last week that the startup had actually engaged in a much deeper partnership with the Zurich-based bulge bracket bank UBS.What we do with a partner like UBS is different than what we do with other partners, said Sha. In the UBS case, SigFig is working more closely with their wealth management advisors than with some of the other partners that are just deploying SigFigs toolkit across part of their network.While none of the tech-enabled financial services firms have emerged as a clear winner in the broader market, its clear that the industry is rapidly moving to adopt more tech-based services to appeal to their consumer customers  rather than their business banking clients.We are definitely at a watershed moment, where a lot of financial institutions are embracing this idea of digital wealth management, says Sha.
