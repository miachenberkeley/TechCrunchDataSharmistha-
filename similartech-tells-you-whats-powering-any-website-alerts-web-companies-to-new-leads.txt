Over the years, developershave turned to resources like BuiltWith to help them figure out what technology is under the hood powering todays websites  including things like shopping carts, analytics, hosting platforms and more. Now BuiltWith has new competition: SimilarTech, which not only monitors the technologies used by any site, but also automates the process of finding leads for web companies.If the name sounds familiar, its because SimilarTech is actually a spin-out from the web analytics platform, SimilarWeb, which last fall raised another $25 million, valuing its business at $400 million.SimilarTechs service began its life as a passion project by former SimilarWeb software engineers Yaniv Hadad (now CEO at SimilarTech) and Eyal Weiss (CTO). When it grew, they decided to turnit into its own company.But two companiesare still affiliated. Not only do they share the same branding, SimilarWeb also owns a stake in SimilarTech as it shares traffic data with them. This allows SimilarTech to offer different levels of segmentation  like by industry or by country, for example  which isnt currently available on other platforms.SimilarTech has actually been operating in stealth mode for the past six months, and today includes clients like Google, PayPal, Facebook, Amazon and other smaller, web-based platforms, like Paddle, Playbuzz, and Skimlinks, whichare looking to determine whos using their competitors technology, or find customer leads.While the value proposition is somewhat like othermeasurement resources such asBuiltWith or lead-gen platforms like Datanyze, SimilarTech aims for a broader scope with its service. Instead of simply uncovering the technology of websites andhighlighting web trends, its using SimilarWebs comprehensive data  like traffic insights andgeo segmentation  to offer a better understanding of the websitesin question.In addition, SimilarTech aids in lead generation by findingpotential customers for web companies.It does this by profiling websites, including details like category, geography, web traffic and technology usage.And it will send out an email alert to customers every time a target site stops using acompetitors product or technology. This can help in timing the outreach appropriately  for example, if someone just left a free trial of your competitors technology, it could be a good time to try to convert them into your own customer.This process of tracking technology can also help companies reduce their own churn  as in the case of a customer who begins trialling a competitors technology, for instance, before theyve cancelled their service with your company.SimilarTech also provides its customers with the verified emails of relevant people within the target companies as part of the lead.The business model involved here is freemium-based, with a free version that lets users search for any site and see what technology it uses, as well as compare market trends (this is like BuiltWith, but SimilarTech has nice graphics), market share among different technologies, and it looks at things like geographic distribution. It will also generate limited reports of leads.The paid version begins at $290 per month and the price scales as customers ask for bigger lists, geographic segmentation, or more verified emails.SimilarWeb also used a freemium model, much to its advantage  this makes it a resource for those in the industry, allowing it to gain mindshare. It then makes money off its Pro tiers. SimilarTechclearlybelieves that model will work for its web tech and lead-gen platform, too.Today, SimilarTech is a team of five in Tel Aviv, and looking to double over the next year.
