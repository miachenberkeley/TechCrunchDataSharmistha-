Simply Framed, the online shop that helps you get any artwork custom framed, is today announcing a host of new features to simplify the process.The company launched back in 2014 in collaboration with an established framing shop based in Miami to offer affordable custom framing to anyone with internet access and the ability to ship packages through the mail.With the updated version of the service, Simply Framed is adding more frames to the collection (now totaling 24 frames) as well as features that make the ordering process more efficient.For example, users can now start the process by labeling which type of art theyre framing, from prints to personal photos to photography, posters, original works on papers, canvases, certificates, and much more. This will automatically generate recommended frames, based on art type and size, so that users dont have to sift through frames that wouldnt be relevant.Of course, folks who dont like the recommended frames can browse through all the other options by scrolling down on the website. Users can also start the entire order process by selecting a frame first, instead of selecting their type of art and size.Beyond ease of ordering, Simply Framed has vastly expanded their collection of offerings. Frame styles now include light walnut, dark walnut, stainless silver, luxe gold and luxe silver, as well as a thinner version of the Canvas Float frame. Plus, Simply Framed has introduced new mat styles: no mat (full bleed), no mat with a spacer, single mat, single mat with a reveal, double mat with a black or additional white mat, float on a foam core lift with a spacer.The redesigned website allows users to visualize their own art in all of the different mat styles, alongside the frame, so they know exactly how the piece will look once shipped.Users can also choose what type of hanging hardware theyd prefer, whether it be a hanging wire or D-rings.Weve seen a number of startups enter the custom framing space, as lugging around art, making a selection in a store, and picking up the finished product is a tedious and expensive process. YC-backed Level Frames offers a similar product to Simply Framed, and it wouldnt be surprising to see more startups sprout up in this space.
