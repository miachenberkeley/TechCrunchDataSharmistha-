RedMart, an online grocery service in Singapore, has closed a$26.7 million round in preparation for an upcoming Series C which will be used to expand acrossSoutheast Asia.The roundwas ledby existinginvestors Garena,SoftBank Ventures Korea, Visionnaire Ventures, and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The company said new investors, including Far East Ventures,participated too.This fresh injection meansfour-year-old Redmarthas raised over $50 million from investors.Were planning a much larger Series C round later this year, this bridge round gives us plenty of runway and capital for the current initiatives, such asour grocery marketplace, andbuilding out an on-demand marketplace, RedMart CEO and co-founder Roger Egan told TechCrunch in an interview.Egan declined to reveal how large the upcoming round might be,nor did he say which cities the company is looking to move into.Drawing on high-profile startup failures in the grocery and delivery space, Egan said RedMart has been patiently working on its core business in Singapore before entertaining the idea of expanding its horizons.The vision is to go into other product categories and provide near instant delivery, and were building towards international expansion, Egan added. We havent expanded yet because groceries is a difficult category. [U.S.-based startup]Webvan, for example,didnt understand how to make money, and grew too quickly. A lotof that team went to Amazon Fresh, and stayed in Seattle for over four years and only recently have theybeen expanding.Well be able to expand faster now that weve spent four and a half years learning this business.Unlike newer e-commerce and on-demand companies, RedMart owns its logistics and warehouse chain. That, Egan argued, gives it a position of strength when it comes to venturing into other product categories  particularly given the complexities associated with grocery delivery, where the average customer basket is a lot higher than say fashion or electronics products.Starting with groceries gives us a big advantage when it comes to being the store for everything, he added. Itseasier for us to move into other categories, rather than an e-commerce firm move into groceries.Aside from revealing the new funding, RedMart also announced that former Amazon executiveColin Bryar has become its new COO. Co-founderVikramRupani, who had held the COO and CFO roles, is shifting to President. Egan said that Bryar, who spent two yearsas technical advisor to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, would be responsible forcommercial, operations, engineering, and marketing at RedMart.Amazon may be in the news for all the wrong reasons right now, but Egan  who has a number of former Amazon staff at RedMart  said theres a lot to admire about Amazon, in terms of their focus on the customer and innovation.In terms of RedMarts own business right now, the company said only that it offers 15,000 products across its B2C serviceand marketplace, a platform for small and independent grocers in Singapore to reach customers via the web.Our business [GMV, partners and SKUs] isgrowing 12-15% per month, so clearly theres still a lot of pent up demand in Singapore, Egan said. Ourmarketplace isgrowing extremely rapidly, and it could soon eclipse our B2C service.All our metrics are trending in right direction and theres a clear path to profitability, but as long as you cangrow in a sustainable way, you should keep on investing in growth  and thats what were doing, Egan added. Everyone thinks Singapore is a small market, but groceries here are worth $16 billion a year you can build a multi-billion business in just groceries and just Singapore.Launching overseas from scratch will be a new challenge for Redmart, despite its learnings in Singapore, and Egan said it will start off slow at first. Over time, he said, the company hopes to be in a few more cities in Southeast Asia.
