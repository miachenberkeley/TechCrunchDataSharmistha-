Free calling and messaging serviceViber could be banned inSouth Korea, after the company lost a patent suit todomestic operator SK Telecom.Korea Herald reports that a court ruled in favor of SK Telecoms claim that Vibersfeature of reorganizing selected information from contact numbers saved in a smartphone into the application violated a 2006-registered patent from the operator.SK Telecom sued Viber, which was bought by Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten for $900 million last year, back in November. Initially, the operator pursued four patents, however three were dismissed during the courts investigation.Viber CEO Talmon Marcus told TechCrunch that thecompany is currently studying thematter before it releases a longer statement. Representatives from SK Telecom did not respond to our requests for comment.The immediate implication of the ruling is notclear. Theres not been anofficialannouncement that Viber is blocked, althoughSK Telecom told Korea Herald that its iOS and Android apps would be outlawed in the country.The real story here is not about Viber, butthe potential implications of the patent on other messaging apps.The patent in question is incrediblyvague. Given the similarities indesign and functionality of almost all chatapps, it is plausible that itcould be used for litigation againstmanyothermessaging services.One in particularly is likely to be in SK Telecomsthinking: Kakao Talk.The free calling and texting app isthought to be installed on more 95 percent of smartphones in Korea,and its popularity led to parent Kakao merging with Korean web giant Daum in a $3 billion deal last year.Kakao Talk doesnt have the international reach of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, WeChat and others, but it is utterly dominant in Korea. Korean consumers use it to make free calls and send free messages, not to mention play games. The former two points anger operators which resentthata free app (that runs on their network)is cutting intotheir potential revenue from voice and SMS services by offering bothfor free.We know that SK Telecom and other Korean operators dont like Kakao, sincethey throttled the Kakao Talk servicewhen it first emerged as a threat.Marcos previously told Korean media that the lawsuit was a surprise, since Viber doesnt have a particularly large following in the country. Thats important because it givesSK Telecomaperfect test case through which it can asses the potential to makea more legitimate, court-led move against Kakao Talk.While SK Telecom didnt respond to our requests for comment, it did provide a quote to Korea Heraldwhich doesnt rule out the possibility of future litigation.The [patent winagainst Viber]does not necessarily mean that it will spread to other messenger apps like Kakao Talk. We have not reviewed such moves, an official from the operator is quoted as saying.The tl;dr here is that operators dont like having their already shrinking margins reduced by chat apps. While many in emerging markets actually work with the likes of WhatsApp, Line and Facebook to sellpackaged data bundles and services to their customers, South Korea is a different place.The country has amore mature telecom market, and its one where much of operators customer base are on postpaid deals with data contracts. Multimedia and value-added services are important potential growth areas for operators, but Kakao Talk is a thorn in their side.Thats because the servicehas become a portal for games and multimedia services, which essentially leaves telecomoperators to take the role of dumb pipe thatprovides the data services to power them. Operators would clearly like greater involvement (and revenue) than that.This patent  no matter how vague could represent a bargaining chip, or opportunity to change the status quo in Korea in favor of SK Telecom and other operators.Its still early days though, and KakaoTalk hasnot been on the receiving end of action from SK Telecom.We are aware of the SKT-Viber ruling, we havent received or heard of anything re KakaoTalk from SKT or other operators regarding it at this time, a spokesperson for Daum Kakao told TechCrunch.Dont be surprised if that situation changes in the not-too-distant future.
