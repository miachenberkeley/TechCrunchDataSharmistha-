While Uber and Lyft now have a glorifiedmonopoly onintracity transportation, there is still a need for a safe, reliable transportation option that candisrupt longer distance trip providers like Greyhound and Amtrak.Thatswhere Skedaddle comes in. While only founded a few months ago, the NY-based startup has already moved over 45,000 people between major cities by letting users tap into existing but underutilized charter bus infrastructure.So how exactly does this work? After downloading Skedaddles app, users can either create a new route or join an existing route.Once a minimum of nine people have committed to the route, the company arranges the deployment of a professionally drivenshuttle, van, or bus.Each route has a standard seat price which is based on distance and other factors. However, Skedaddle entices early route signups by offering the route creator a free seat, anda 20 percent discount for the next nine riders to commit.But after that, everyone else pays the same price. Either way, considerable savings over paying for a gas or shelling out for a pricey Amtrak ticket.Charter companies are also happy, because they can now monetize previously underused assets by giving extra rides.While still only operating in a few east coast cities (LA and SF will come this spring), Skedaddle has seen strong traction around both city-to-city routes, as well as one-time transportation needs, like a concert or ski weekend.While routes can be set up as either one-way or round-trip, the company expects that over time, as density and demand grows, most trips will become one-way.The company has raised $1M in angel funding, and is currently raisingon a seed round.
