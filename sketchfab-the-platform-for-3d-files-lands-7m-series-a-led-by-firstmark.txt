Sketchfab, the online platform for 3D file sharing, has today announced the close of a $7 million Series A round led by FirstMark Capital. Existing investors  TechStars, Balderton, Partech and Borealis also participated in the Series A round. At its core, Sketchfab is a marketplace for 3D files, whether it lies in creating web-sharable 3D files, browsing them, searching specifically, or buying them. By making these types of files shareable and accessible via web, Sketchfab is becoming the go-to place for designers and creators to browse and share 3D files. In fact, the company says it has topped 300,000 files on the site. The company makes money by offering premium tools to creators (many of the base-level tools are free to use for everyone, but extra features come at a cost). In the future, Sketchfab will generate revenue from transactions that go down on Sketchfab, from which the company will take a slice, and the third is featured/sponsored content that will get prime placement on the website (again at a cost). With the new funding, Sketchfab hopes to invest more heavily in the worlds of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Heres what CEO and founder Alban Denoyel had to say about it: Over the past few years, WebGL has become the standard for displaying 3D graphics in a browser, supported across all desktop and mobile browsers. Whats coming next is WebVR, which will give us powerful ways to communicate with VR and AR SDKs.As it stands now, Sketchfab already offers an experience for most of the main VR headsets out there, including Oculus, GearVR and Cardboard through Chromium.
