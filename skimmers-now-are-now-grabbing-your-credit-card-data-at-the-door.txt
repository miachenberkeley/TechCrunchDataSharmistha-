Just when you thought you were safe, the card skimmers are at it again. This time theyre placing their card readers inside the door locks that require you to dip your card before you can enter an ATM vestibule.According to Brian Krebs, the scammers hide the readers inside the comparatively unnoticed locks and then add a small hidden camera around the ATM. They grab your card data via the reader as you enter and then match it up with your PIN, which they read by watching your hands on the PIN pad.In this case the hackers installed their card reader inside a fake lock faceplate and then stuck a dismembered Casio camera into a strip of thin plastic. This allows them to retrieve the card data separately from the PIN data and it puts them safely outside for at least one of those actions. Interestingly, you dont actually have to dip your debit card to get past most vestibule doors.Writes Krebs:Pro tip: These door security devices arent too smart, and most of them will happily accept just about any card with a magnetic stripe. But dont take my word for it: Next time you pass one of these ATM vestibules on the street, whip out your library card or ID card and see for yourself.Again, I implore you, dear reader, to hide your PIN code with your other hand every time you type it. This simple step will save you time  and money  as hackers bypass your card because they cant grab your digits.
