UK broadcaster Sky is putting focus on emerging markets and online streaming after it made a $45 million investment iniFlix, a one-year-oldcompany thatrivalsNetflix in Southeast Asia.Sky said that the deal is strategicand it will see the two parties work together to identify areas of future collaboration.It seems likely, then, that iFlix  which currently operates in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines and charges upwards ofaround $3 per month  will gain content from Skysprogramming library over time.iflix has quickly established itself as Southeast Asias most exciting and fastest-growing streaming TV service. There are lots of opportunities for Sky and iflix to work together and share expertise as both companies continue to expand,Andrew Griffith, Skys Group CFO, said in a statement.iFlix confirmed to TechCrunch that it also tookan undisclosed sumfrom Indonesia-based TV and content company Emtek Group, which invested alongside Sky viaits subsidiary Surya Citra Media. Thats a clear hint that Indonesia is in iFlixsexpansion plans.Beyondits famed satellite TV services, Sky also runsNOW TV, Sky Online and Sky Go on the web and mobile.iFlix is a joint venture betweenCatcha Group  a Malaysia-based organization that runs a plethora of online businesses  and U.S.-based investment firm Evolution Media Capital. The company raised $30 million in funding from Catcha, PLDT, a telecom conglomerate in the Philippines, and Singapore-based VC firm Jungle Venturesto expand in Southeast Asia but it also harborslarger ambitious.Back in December, we reported that iFlix was talking to investors about raising up to $150 million to grow the service across Asia, and expand into Africa, Latin America and other emerging markets. Sky is certainly a strong name to add to its investor and partner list to helpthat global plan come to fruition. (Film giant MGM is another of iFlixs strategic investors.)Netflix, of course, beat its rivals  and surprised the industry  when it went global with an expansion into 130 new countries in January. It may be the best known name in the industry, but most of its popular content is restricted and unavailable in many of its new launch countries. That leaves the door open foriFlix and other regional players like HOOQ, a joint venture in Southeast Asia between operator Singtel, Sony and Warner, to offer more dedicated programming.Mobile-first media consumption models, higher pricing and complications around payments mayalso be areas where Netflix initially struggles to compete with local rivals, too.Updated with confirmation of investment fromSurya Citra Media
