Apples single-port-wonder MacBook gets a mid-season upgrade today with faster processors, better graphics, faster internal memory and an hour more of battery life today. You can also get Apples Rose Gold finish on a Mac for the first time ever, if thats your sort of thing.The technical nuts of it are that the MacBook can now be ordered withdual-core Intel M processors at up to 1.3GHz with 1866 MHz memory, Intel HD Graphics 515 with a claimed 25% faster graphics performance and faster internal storage. The new guts are getting you better performance but also better battery life with what Apple says is 10 hours of web browsing or 11 hours of iTunes movie playback.A fetching rose gold is the newest addition to the MacBook rangeYou can get the new MacBooks starting at the same $1,299 price for the 1.1 GHz M3 processor or $1,599 for the 1.2 GHz M5, and all of the models now come with 8GB of RAM standard across all configurations. You can bumpyourprocessor up to a 1.3 GHz M7 if you do a build to order.This is a minor but nice mid-stride update to the MacBook lineupthat features Intels sixth generation Core M processors, also known as Skylake. Many folks have been waiting for Skylake processors to make their appearance in Apple laptops and this is the tip of it. Other models are sure to come.Thecolor is gorgeous on the new iPads so if youre hankering for the Rose Gold then youre in luck. The bumping of the minimum amount of RAM in the laptop should do well toquell one complaint of early adopters (including me) in that the base models tend to chug a bit with a bunch of Chrome tabs open or while doing memory intensive video or audio editing.So if youre interested in the MacBook, bueno. If youre interested in a Skylake MacBook Pro, keep waiting ya filthy animal.
