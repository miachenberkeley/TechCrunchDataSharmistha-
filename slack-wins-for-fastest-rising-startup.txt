Slack is growing up and to the right and as such a rapid climber won a Crunchie last night for Fastest Rising Startup at TechCrunchs 9th annual awards show. Slack also claims to have a more diverse workforce than any other startup and smartly chose to send four of its engineers  all of them black and female  to accept the award on stage.One of the women Slack sent to receive the Fastest Rising Startup award, Erika Baker, was also a runner-up for the Include Diversity award. We spoke with all four women backstage after winning to see what they hoped their presence onstage would do to inspire more women and minorities in engineering roles.
