Tim Attia, co-founder and CEO of Slice Labs, said theres a ticking time bomb threatening the on-demand economy  namely, insurance and liability.Attias tackling that problem with Slice, which will offer insurance for on-demand workers and providers, starting with rideshare drivers and then homeshare hosts. The startup is announcing today that it has raised $3.9 million in seed funding from Horizon Ventures and XL Innovate.Dont companies like Uber and Airbnb provide insurance already? They do, but Attia (whos spent more than a decade in the insurance industry) argued that theres still a significant amount of risk.For example, Ubers coverage changes depending on where the driveris in the process (going online versus accepting the trip versus starting the ride), with the expectation that the driver will have their own personal or commercial policy. He also said Ubers policy is in Ubers name, not the drivers, which could lead to legal complications.Im not picking on Uber and Airbnb  its the only thing they can do, Attia said.Slice, on the other hand, aims to offer new kinds of insurance products designed for on-demand workers.These products will be available on a transactional basis  so a ridesharing driver should be covered from the moment they start driving or get into the car, but theyre only paying for coverage during the time that theyre working (making it more affordable than just taking out a pricey commercial insurance policy).Technically, another firm is providing the actual insurance, but it sounds like Slice is doing most of the actual work.Attia plans to launch Slices first products in June. Even though Slice is based in New York City, Attia said hes still deciding where to offer coverage first. He also hopes to work with on-demand services to offer Slice insurance through the services sign-up process.He added that over time, Slice can use data to improve its products and pricing, for example determining whether an uberXbehaves more like a person because its their car, or if they behave more likea cab.
