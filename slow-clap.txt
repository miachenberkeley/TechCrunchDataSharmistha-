Weve seen startups helping brands tap influencers to promote themselves on social media platforms like Vine and Instagram, so it might be time for a new influencer marketing startup, Applause, thats focused on live video  particularly Twitters Periscope app.Its certainly a platformthat CEO Jon Jacques is familiar with. In addition to working for a couple of years at marketing startup Virool, Jacques is a street magician, and by livestreaming his tricks, he attracted a following of nearly 100,000 users on Periscope. (And, as you can see in the video below, he also workedwith The Ellen Degeneres Show.)Jacques said that he started to hear from marketers who wanted to pay himto promote their brands and products, making him think, Wait a second here  There was a clear opportunity to actually have a career on Periscope. And ashe discussed this with Dan Ragan (who was then head of influencer marketing at GroupM), they decided that there was a broader opportunity to build a network of Periscope influencers.Periscope users who have already signed up for Applause include musician Todd Carey, news producer Courtney Harvey, hypnotherapist Grace Smith and TV host Alex Butler.Weve noticed a new breed of influencer, Jacques said. You have your Instagrammers, your Snapchatters and people on Vine, but this content is entirely different. This is live. He added that hes seen influencers on other platforms totally bomb on live video: They arent able to hold that audience in the palm of their hands with this new style.Jacques said the early campaigns have seen anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 viewers on the livestream, then tens of thousands more viewers in the following 24 hours. Whats really impressive, though, is the engagement, with 29 percent of viewers making it through seven-minute brand videos and an average of 900 live comments per video.And while the initial focus is on Periscope, Jacques said Applause is also interested in Facebook Live and, potentially, other livestreaming video platforms  he suggested that those two are going to be the two key players, but also acknowledged, The war is not won.He added that while Applause has already createdits own datacollection tools, there are plans to further build out the technology side of the business.
