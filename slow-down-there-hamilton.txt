Good news for those of us with a fast car, a lead foot and poor impulse control: Ford is rolling out a new Speed Limiter feature. The car uses a camera to read the speed limit signs before giving you a heads up if your velocity is making youa police-magnet.Whoa, there, Jack. Take er easy.For now, the technology is only being rolled out on the companys European line of cars, including the Edge, Galaxy and S-MAX vehicles. The Euro-market is a particularly good match for the technology, given that there are more than 35,000 speed cameras across Europe, and speeding tickets turning up in the mail is practically a national sport across much of the continent. Smile for the camera, indeed.Its yet another tiny piece of the self-driving car puzzle falling into place. In this case, in a car with theIntelligent Speed Limiter activated, a camera will read traffic signs ahead, adjusting the cars speed without the driver needing to get involved. If the car youre driving has a navigation package, it will augment the camera data with the speed limit data from the maps. Clever.You can see the technology in action in the video below.
