Ad spending on the mobile web doubled in the first half of 2015 (compared to the same period last year), according to a new report fromSmaato.Specifically, Smaato saw itstotal ad spendsplit between62 percent on apps and 38 percent on the mobile web. So the mobile web is still pretty far behind, butits doing better than it was in 2014, when the breakdown was72 percent apps versus 28 percent mobile web.Total ad spend on the mobile web is up 101 percent year-over-year. The volume of mobile web ad impressions has also doubled, and now accounts for 41 percent of Smaatos total supply.Heres one possible reason for the growth: the fact that users are following article links in social apps, leading to browser-based reading even if its within the Facebook or Twitter app.The shift to mobile began with the mobile web  and then apps took over, said Smaato CEO Ragnar Kruse in thepressrelease announcing the report. Although we cant say for sure whether were looking at a huge comeback of the medium, the fact remains that publishers and advertisers cant afford to ignore the mobile web.Smaatos Global Trends in Mobile Programmatic report is based on data from the companys ad impressions  it serves 6 billion ads every day, reaching 600 million users each month.Oh, and Android accounted for 35 percent of ad supply (as you can see in the graphicabove), compared to 20 percent for iOS.
