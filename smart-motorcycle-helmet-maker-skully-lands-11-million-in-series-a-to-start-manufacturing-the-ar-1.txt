The Indiegogo campaign item has yet to shipand thecompany saysit is hoping to start sending them out to early backers soon.SKULLY is also in the midst of hiring a bunch of software and hardware engineers to help with the manufacturing process. It willlikely be using the new workforce to developing future products beyond the first helmet as well. However, asource close to the company informed TechCrunch that SKULLY has a history of high turnover, and has let go of several employees in the last half year.A spokesperson for the company said they believed SKULLY had a lower than average turnover for an SF startup.SKULLY founder and CEO Marcus Weller wasntready to discussfuture plans for the company. Instead, heemphasized that SKULLYis growing and that the new funds would be used to hire more people and ship the first product.There are a lot of expenses involved in the manufacturing part of it.
