Elemental Path is now accepting pre-orders for its smart toy products.The smart toy maker made its debut on Kickstarter this year with a line of what it calls CogniToys, or toys that learn and grow with the child that plays with them.These toys, including a 3D printed dinosaur, are powered by IBMs Watson supercomputer to help each toy listen to and engage with its child owner and help them learn new things.The toys respond to childrens questions within seconds and, says the company, becomes smarter the more the child uses the toy to learn about its world.The Elemental Path Kickstarter campaign exceeded its original $50,000 goal, raising $275,000 from 2,256 backers in March 2015. The smart toy maker started producing its dino toys soon after  adding different colors and prototypes fans could vote on.The smart Dinoswill only be available for pre-order in a small batch and for a limited time. Elemental Path then plans to shut down orders of the first version of its product until the holidays in 2016.
