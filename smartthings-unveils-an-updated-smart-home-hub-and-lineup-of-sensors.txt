SmartThings smart home devices are getting a lot sleeker  and a lot more powerful  as of today.The company today is releasing a new line of updated home sensors and a new, more powerful hub. In addition, SmartThings is rolling out a more simplified application centeredaround specific events and spots in a home, such as a bedrooms and kitchens for locations, and events like intrusions. The company is also releasing a new set of developer tools that are designed to make it easier to integrate new devices with the SmartThings hub.To make it easier, basically, the next-generation products aim to solve that is everything ok at home? problem out of the box, SmartThings CEO AlexHawkinsonsaid.SmartThings is releasing an update to itsfivesensors to make them feel more contemporary, but there are nearly 200 compatibledevices in the SmartThings ecosystem, Hawkinsonsaid. Part of the selling point of the SmartThings hub is that its attached to an open ecosystem where the technology is constantly evolving and completely open, and there are over 10,000 developers in the community.This is the first wave of products the company has released since it was acquired by Samsungin August last year. With SmartThings, Samsung found a way into smart home monitoring, giving itself a foothold in homes much in the same way Google found its way into smart home monitoring by acquiring Nest.The new hub comes with a more powerful processor that enables video monitoring and a battery that will allow it to operate for up to 10 hours if the power goes out. It will also remain connected to the devices in the home, allowing it to handle some processes without actually being connected to the Internet usingZigbee, Z-wave, and local IP connected devices.These new releasescome at a time whenconnected devicesare becoming ever-increasingly present in the home. Google bought companies like Nest and Dropcam to get into homes. Companies are even trying to develop smart appliances like refrigerators. Samsungs acquisition of SmartThings increasingly makes sense as more and more connected devices roll out.What we found was in the smart home, the reason the race is on now, once someone gets up and running you look for things that are compatible and then you spread out from there, Hawkinson said. You might start someone with home monitoring, but thentheymight be interested in connected lighting.Of course, the elephant in the room is HomeKit, Apples smart home platform. Apple is expected to unveil a new Apple TV later this year, and its certainly possible that it could become a powerful hub for smart home devices. ButSmartThings has built a first-mover advantage and a largedeveloper ecosystemto the point that it could dwarf ApplesHomeKit platform.The company produces its own sensors as well. Theresa sensorthat detects motion, one that detects when something is opened or closed, and one that detects when someone leaves or arrives. There is also a devicethat plugs intopower outlets that can turn adevice on and off, and a sensorthat detects water in case of a leak or flood. SmartThings already sold these sensors, but they are getting an update to give them a more modern look.For example, when a door is opened it may trigger an event in the app that indicates that someone has entered the home. It uses a small multi-purpose sensor that would attach to a door to detect that it opens, and if its opening at a time thats unexpected, it may flag the owner that an intrusion is taking place.Aconnected SmartThings camera wont actually stream video to the cloud all the time. Instead, it will only stream a recording over the Internet when viewed through the app. The device also has a buffer of the video before the event and after, so the user can see a clip of what happened around the event  which is free until the end of the year, and then becomes a premium service that costs $4.99 per month.All this hardware connected to the internet of course brings a level of risk to a users security. To mitigate that, SmartThings regularly pays for third-party audits, Hawkinsonsaid. If a device is certified with SmartThings, it has a very locked down path from the device to the cloud, the hub and the account, and SmartThings can also issue firmware updates to it.Everything we do is open, we publish a security white paper, and we have acertification program, Hawkinsonsaid. When developers come they can build stuff in a sandbox,but once they want to expose it to others it runs through these formal tests.The hub will cost $99, and the sensors range from $30 to $55. Theyll be available for purchase today on the SmartThings and Samsung websites.
