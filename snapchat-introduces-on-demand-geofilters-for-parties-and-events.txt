Snapchat is introducing yet another revenue stream today in the form of on-demand geo-filters. As it stands now, Snapchat already has two types of geofilters. Community Geofilters can not include logos or marketing and can be submitted for free. For example, where I live in Brooklyn, there are options for Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Brooklyn. The other type of geofilter is a Sponsored Geofilter, where big brands can cover a large area with marketing-based filters. With on-demand geofilters, anyone with a bit of design savvy can pay Snapchat to create and distribute their own custom geofilters in a specific area for an allotted time. The minimum size for these geofilters is 5,000 square feet (enough to cover an office building) and the minimum amount of time the geofilter can exist is 30 minutes. On the other side of the spectrum, users can spread their on-demand geofilters as far as 5,000,000 square feet. The turnaround time for review is about a day, and pricing starts at $5. This could open up a broader revenue model for Snapchat, which currently makes money from brand-designed geofilters and in-app purchases from users who want to replay a snap. With the new on-demand geofilters, small and medium-sized businesses can now use Snapchat as their own marketing channel. And beyond that, users will likely send more snaps if they have access to more filters. Folks who purchase on-demand geofilters will have the ability to view the metrics on their filters, by both views as well as uses. You can learn more about on-demand geofilters here.
