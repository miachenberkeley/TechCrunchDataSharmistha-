Tuesday was/is* Internet Safety Day (*depending on your location) and Snapchat took the opportunity to raise awareness of safety on its service after it introduced its Safety Centerresources site in partnership with three non-profit organizations.Most of our community uses Snapchat every day, and its a big part of their lives, thats why weve built this safety center with real-world, practical advice for staying safe while using Snapchat, the company said.The Safety Center  which can be foundat snapchat.com/safety  is primarily targeted at parents and teachers who know little about the service, but there is also information forusers, such as its community guidelines.Snapchat said it has partneredwith three non-profits  ConnectSafely, iKeepSafe, and UK Safer Internet Center forthisproject.This move to raise awareness of safety practices makes sense for Snapchat as the messaging app seeks to become an integral part of the internet lives of young people in the U.S., and beyond. In many cases it already is, and, with the launch of its Discover platform  featuring content from media companies, and even an exclusive music video from Madonna  the company aims to makes its app even moreengaging, and a daily must for young people.Snapchat made even more headlines than usual this week after a teenage user posteda photo with the body of a 16-year-old who he is believed to have been murdered. Police said that a screenshot of the Snapchat image is a key piece of evidence in the case. Though particularly gruesome, Snapchats involvement in this incident shows how mainstream it has become.But Internet safety isnt just about how users behave. Companies themselves have a responsibility to securely storedata and information from their users. Snapchat hasnt exactly got a stellar record inthis department  the companyblamed third party services for leaking data of thousands of users last year, but it did set aboutincreasing user data security by disabling allthird-party appsthat plug into its service.
