Happy 4/20 day everybody! To celebrate, Snapchat teamed up with the estate of Bob Marley, and the results were  unfortunate.Snapchat created a lens that makes your facelook more like the legendary musicians by adding Marley-like features  a cap, dreadlocks, a beard and darker skin. Amusing? Probably for some users, but it comes with some really awful historical associations. The lensprompted a number of users to pointout that its basically the contemporary equivalent of blackface.Oh my god oh my god oh my god snapchat put a Bob Marley filter and its bad and in poor taste, to say the least pic.twitter.com/syAHGXp3f6 Alp Ozcelik (@alplicable) April 20, 2016To be fair to Snapchat, this isnt something the company did on its own  it was sanctioned by the Marley estate. (Other things the Marley estate have approved include Bob Marley-branded marijuana and a 4/20-themed mix on Spotify.)Plus, this kind of thing isnt totally unprecedented. MSQRD offered lenses that put Obama and Snoop masks over your face  but the lenses appear to be gone, post-Facebook acquisition (it still has a rasta lens that doesnt change skin color). You could also argue that the mask approach is less icky than actually darkening the appearance of someones skin.Happy 4/20 and Holy Shit Who Okayed This from Snapchat pic.twitter.com/NF0H2kurgv Patrick Monahan (@pattymo) April 20, 2016The lens we launched today was created in partnership with the Bob Marley Estate, and gives people a new way to share their appreciation for Bob Marley and his music. Millions of Snapchatters have enjoyed Bob Marleys music, and we respect his life and achievements.Additional reporting by Brian Heater
