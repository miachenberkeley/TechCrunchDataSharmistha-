It didnt quite add up when Fortune broke the news last week that Snapchat would spend a $100 million to acquire Bitstrips, the maker of personalized avatar stickers called Bitmoji. Snapchat didnt have anywhere to put them.But today, Snapchat launched Chat 2.0, a huge product update that includes the ability to send over 200 stickers to friends. Now its quite apparent. Snapchat could use Bitstrips to let youmake and send stickers that look like you.While the companies have refused to confirm the deal or reveal the plan, the motive has finally come into focus.

However, that seems like a waste of a growth opportunity.Snapchats Chat 2.0 experienceInstead, it might make sense to keep them running independently but with an option to import your avatar stickers into Snapchat.
