When something happens like, I dont know, Xbox Live going down, what do you do? A lot of us run to Twitter to complain about it. Not because our complaints will be heard, but because hot damn sometimes it just feels good.Today, one Xbox Live user was particularly miffed. His name happens to be Snoop Dogg. He had a message for Xbox, the Live team, EA sports, Microsofts janitor, the world, and Microsofts founder Bill Gateswho Im pretty sure isnt that involved in the business anymore:Fix your shit.
