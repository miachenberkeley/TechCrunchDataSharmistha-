In total, the store has now seen more than 5 billion visits, up from 3 billion in January. All of those apps and devices add up windows users have spent more than75 billion hours using the Windows 10 platform.Microsoft says Windows 10 continues to outpace all of Microsofts previous Windows launches. It is currently seeing four times the growth rate of Windows 8 (although, to be fair, that release was met with a big fat meh from reviewers, somost businesses never updated to it), and compared to Windows 7, the growth rate is up 145 percent.As Microsoft also noted today,this update isnt just coming from home users and small businesses  enterprises are also adopting Windows 10 faster than they did any other recent Windows update.
