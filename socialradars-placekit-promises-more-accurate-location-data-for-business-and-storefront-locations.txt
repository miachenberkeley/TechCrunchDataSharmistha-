Online street maps have become incredibly accurate over the last few years, but most maps arent all that precise when it comes to knowing exactly where on a street astore, restaurant or other business is located. Thats why your Uber driver sometimes wants to drop you off in the alley behind a restaurant, for example. SocialRadars newPlaceKit promises to offer far moreaccurate location data for business and storefront locations  so accurate, indeed, that it can even tell youwhere the entrance doors to these businesses are located.Its obviously easy to make these claims, but thecompany put together a demo sitethat puts its mapping data next to Googles. Looking at that, its pretty clear who has the more accurate data.According toSocialRadar CEO Michael Chasen, who previously co-founded and led the highly successful educational technology firm Blackboard from 1997 to 2012, the company previously tried to build a location-based consumer app. The team, however, quickly realized how inaccurate much of the existing location data for businesses is and decided to build tools to fix this. The first of these new tools was LocationKit, a location manager SDK that developers can use as a drop-in replacement for Apples and Googles location manager tools.While LocationKithelps developers determine where exactly a user is, PlaceKit thenknows exactly whats around that location.PlaceKits location dataEven thoughGoogle Maps virtually always puts a point of interest onto the right block, its often unclear on what street the entrance actually is. With SocialRadars data, on the other hand, there is never any doubt where exactly you need to go to find a store. The team also extended this database to office buildings, so while other mapping services often randomly showacluster of businesses that all share the same office building across a city block, the SocialRadar team organized them all under one address.The same area on Google MapsChasen didnt want to talk too much about the technology the team developed to build this highly accurate location database, but he did say that his teamfigured out how to use street-level imagery with some human interaction and combine that with the companys proprietary algorithms. A lot of that human interaction was based on using Mechanical Turk for some of the more menial tasks, from what I understand, but SocialRadar also filed for a patent for some of the technology it invented.SocialRadars new location database coversall of the United States, but Chasen also showed me that the team testedits tools by building the same data set for Paris, France. Indeed, the plan is to expand SocialRadars service to other countries soon, starting with Europe.For now, SocialRadar plans to license itsdata to enterprises, mobile advertising firms and similarly large development shops first. Sadly, the company doesnt currently offer a self-service plan that would allow any developer to use its data,but Chasentells me the team plans todo this in the future.Given how well SocialRadars technology seems to work, I would be surprised if a large number of businesses that rely on location data for their core user experience wouldnt adopt it (think Uber, Lyft, advertising firms, etc.) or even consider acquiring the company.
