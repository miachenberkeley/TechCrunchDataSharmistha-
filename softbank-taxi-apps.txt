If you live in the U.S., the chances are that your definition of the biggest rival to Uber is Lyft. The ride-sharing service operates in many of the same U.S. cities as Uber, and the two have a keen rivalry, which includes some less-than-ethical practices on both sides. But a new, less obvious, force has emerged out of Asia to offer Uber its stiffest competitionyet: and surprisingly it is a telecom company.SoftBank had no business in taxi-hailing apps until October2014 when it led a $210 million investment in Indias Ola. That deal was announced as the first investment in SoftBanks programto put $10 billion into startups in India. At the time, Ola appeared to bejust one of anumber of deals in India  while that is true, it also turned out to be the first of an expensive set of investments in companies that rival Uber.SoftBank went on to invest $250 million in GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, andlastweek it closed a third deal, leading a $600 million financing round for Chinas Kuadi Dache.The operator, it seems is going all out for taxi apps but it may not stop in Asia.Alibaba led Lyfts$250 million funding roundin April 2014, which the U.S. company had earmarked for international expansion. At the time, the investment was a curious deal for Alibaba but, with the e-commerce giant backing range of other U.S. startups  including chat app Tango  it looked like an exploratory move to get some skin in promising companies in North America.However, SoftBank and Alibaba have a long history of collaboration  SoftBank is famously an early investor in Alibaba, and both companies put money into Kuadi Dache  and it could just be that Lyft forms a part of SoftBanks taxi app focus. Perhaps the Japanese firm will put its own money in at a later date, or it will use its relationshipwith Alibaba to forma loose alliance to share information and tactics.So why is SoftBank in the market for taxi apps?The push is part ofSoftBanks aforementioned program to invest ine-commerce businesses in emerging markets. It put $100 million into Indonesias Tokopedia last year, for example, and it has also backed Snapdeal (via a $627 million round) andHousing.com in India.Theres plenty of reason to believe that SoftBank plans to weave its e-commerce investments together  perhaps via app integrations and formal tie-ins, or justsharing of information, experiences, etc, between these companies.Adding taxi apps to its portfolioof investments is important because transportation-on-demand services have the potential to be hugely influential. For one thing, they could becomedaily apps for millions of people to move around, and  for second  they create real-life logistics networks that can be used for all kinds of offline services. Just look at Ubers potential as a logistics network, for example.The future of mobile and mobile apps is not clear at this point,as A16zs Benedict Evans astutely pointed out recently. But what is for certain, however, is that SoftBank believes there will be worthwhile synergies between e-commerce and mobile services in the future no matter whether apps are web-based or not. Taxi apps appear to form a key part of the e-commerce platform that it is in the early stages of assembling.Uber raised close to $2.5 billion from investors last year, but, with SoftBank valued at around $70 billion (a figure that its CEO believes is too low), the U.S. companymay yet return to the table for even more funding as the battle intensifies.SoftBank declined an interview for this story, but a company spokesperson did confirm that the Japanese firmisaiming to maximize synergies with our network of Internet companies/investments around the world.The spokesperson added that there are no immediate plans to establish links between Ola and GrabTaxi but SoftBank expects to see some business synergies in the near future.
