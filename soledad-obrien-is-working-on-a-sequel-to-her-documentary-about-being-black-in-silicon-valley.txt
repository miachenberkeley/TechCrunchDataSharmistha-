Five years have passed since Soledad OBrien covered race in Silicon Valley as part of her documentary series Black in America. Now shes ready to take a second look.Today, OBrien discussed the documentary and the broader issues it raised while onstage as part of TechCrunch Disrupt NY. She said shes encouraged by the way the conversation has changed in the years since Black in America: The New Promised Land  Silicon Valley first aired, particularly the fact that tech companies are now releasing diversity reports revealing details about the race and gender breakdowns of their workforces.I think that in-and-of-itself is a massive step, OBrien said. You only measurethe things that you really care about.She didnt offer too many details about what the new documentary will cover, except that it offers an opportunity to revisit Silicon Valley and see whats changed and whats different.Technology isnt only this area in Silicon Valley [that only affects] computer science majors, OBrien added. Its really everything, its everywhere and the workforce has to be able to benefit.(Full disclosure: TechCrunch founder and former editor Michael Arrington participated, controversially, in the previous film, though he said he was ambushed by the questions about black entrepreneurs and that his more nuanced comments were cut from the interview.)OBrien also discussedher decision to leave CNN and start her own media production company, Starfish Media Group. She explained that when the network wanted to go in a different direction with her morning show Starting Point, she decided it was time to start her own company.OBrien isnt necessarily encouraging every journalist to follow her path  for some, a regular nine-to-five job at an existing media organization makes more sense.But journalism has shifted a lot, she said.Having a lotof skillsand moreopportunities to be flexible with yourcontent  to people who are willing to be entrepreneurial, has a possibilityfor a bigger payoff.
