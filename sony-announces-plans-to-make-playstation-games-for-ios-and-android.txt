It looks like Sony will follow Nintendos cue and focus on mobile gaming. The company announced today that it willform a new business unit tasked with bringing PlayStation titles and IP to iOS and Android devices.That sounds like great news for gamers, but theres a caveat here, it seems.Forward Works, Sonys mobile gaming arm, is going to focus on users based in Japan and Asia, according to todaysannouncement. The division will be formally created on April 1  not a hoax (we hope) and the same datethat Sony Computer Entertainment becomesSony Interactive Entertainment  so were likely to learn more after then.Atsushi Morita, SCEshead in Japan and Asia, will lead Forward Works. Other directorsof the organization include Andrew House, who isGroup CEO of SCE.Nintendo released its first mobile gamethis month, Miitomo. The long-awaited title isnt really a mainstream release, though. Rather, it is asocial app that lets users create cartoon-like avatars  very much like theMiis you can create with the Nintendo Wii. Thats likely to limit its appealto hardcore Nintendo fans.Sony, however, has hinted that its mobile titles will be full-fledged, which makes us optimistic that they will be more universally appealing. Sonys previous effort at tapping smartphones  PlayStation Mobile  was tied toits Vita handheld device. It closed down last year.
