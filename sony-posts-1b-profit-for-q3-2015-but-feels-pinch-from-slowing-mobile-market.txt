Those figures surpassed analyst expectations  according to a FactSet poll  and follow a decent quarter of business in Q2 2015, which include a slim$280 million profit. However,Sony continues to struggle on mobile.In Q3 2015, itsmobile business unit saw its total revenue decline 14.7 percent to384.5 billion JPY ($3.2 billion), althoughoperating revenue grew by 133 percent to $201 million. Thats because Sony is scaling back its struggling smartphone business, in the face of struggles across the industry as global smartphone sales growth continues to slow.In Sonys words: this decrease was due to a significant decrease in smartphone unit sales resulting from astrategic decision not to pursue scale in order to improve profitability.The company added that reduced spend on marketing and promotion, coupled with a shift to high value-addedmodels, improved the operating revenue figure significantly.Instead it was the companys chip business, which has grown thanks to image sensors used by a number of phone makers, which dragged. That division carded an operating loss of11.7 billion JPY ($97 million) as revenue dropped12.6 percent on account ofa decrease in demand for mobile products, and a significant decrease in battery business sales, Sony said.So, while Sony has cut its reliance on smartphones sold to consumers, it couldnt entirely shelter itself from the chill affecting the mobile industry, which hit it in its sensor business instead.Away from mobile, PlayStation continues to be a bright spot for Sony. Its video games console business posting a 10 percent increase in quarterly revenue as operating profit jumped 45 percent to reach 40.2 billion JPY ($335 million). Sony put these changes down to a previous write-down ofPS Vita and PS TV components, and an increase in PlayStation 4 sales.Elsewhere, Sonys imaging business  responsible for digital/video cameras  sawrevenue drop 5 percent to$1.6 billion, but operating profit rise 20 percent to $197 million. It was a similar story for the companys home entertainment  revenue down 4.3 percent to$3.35 billion, profit up 19.8 percent to $260 million  while Sonys music and pictures businesses both contributed profit ($228 million and $170 million) based on increased revenue for the quarter  up 8.2 percent and 26.9 percent respectively.
