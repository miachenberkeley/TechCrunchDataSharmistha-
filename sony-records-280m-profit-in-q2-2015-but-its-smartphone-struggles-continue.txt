Sonys financial turnaround continues withits Q2 2015 period. The Japanese company posted a slim net profit of$280 million (33.6 billion JPY) onrevenue of $15.8 billion (1,892.7 billion JPY). Operating profit came in at $733 million (88 billion JPY).The firm didnt quite hit the highs of the previous three-month period, when it bagged an eight-year high $780 million operating profiton revenue of$14.5 billion,but Q2 2015 is a big jump on the $785 millionlosssuffered one year prior, when it wrote down$1.5 billionfrom its struggling mobile division. That said,revenue forQ2 2014 was around half apercent higher.Unsurprisingly to industry watchers, Sonys smartphone armcontinues to struggle. The company, which recently rejected reports that it would exit the business as it did with its Vaio PC unit, said Sony Mobilesaw a significant decrease in smartphone unit sales resulting from astrategic decision not to pursue scale in order to improve profitability.How significant? Sony Mobiles revenue dropped15 percent to reach $231 billion (279.2 billion JPY) during the quarter. A$172 million (20.6 billion) loss doesnt look good on paper, but it bettered the Q2 2014 loss of$1.58 billion, with that write-down included. Sony Mobile isnt bleeding quite so hard, but its hard to imagine it being aparticularly profitable unit any time soon.Elsewhere, positive foreign exchange rates and continued growth of PlayStation 4 games were positives for Sony. Revenue from itsgame and network services division  where the PS4 falls  rose16.5 percent year-on-year to $3 billion, with a $199 million profit (up 10 percent.)Sony is placing significant emphasis on its highly profitable components business, through which it supplies camera parts to Apple, Samsung and others. That unit reported a $215 million profit on $1.5 billion revenue. While salesgrew 4.1 percent year-on-year, profitabilityincreased by 29 percent which Sony put down to its focus on high value devices. Sonys semiconductor business, another supplier of smartphone makers, also had a solid quarter  reporting a $272 million profit (up 15 percent year-on-year) on revenue of $2.2 billion (up 7 percent).Aside from mobile, Sonys financial services unit dragged the group down with quarterly revenue and profit dropping 22 percent and14 percent year-on-year respectively.Note: This original version of this article was updated to correct the quarterly revenue figure for Sony Mobile.
