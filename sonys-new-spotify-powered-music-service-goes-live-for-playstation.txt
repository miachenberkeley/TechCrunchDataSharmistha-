If youre a PlayStation owner who is also a Spotify addict, then theres good news for you today  Sony and the music streaming service have teamed up to let you listen to your tunes while you game.The Spotify-powered service was announced in January, butitarrived forPlayStation Musictoday. Tracks can be switched using the iOS or Android app, which means PS4 and PS3 customers in 41 countries worldwide canswitch the in-game soundtrack to theirfavorite tunes without interrupting their gaming.Personally Im not so keen on this. Most games are the result of massiveproduction efforts,a key component of which is thesoundtrack which is often developedto add to the experience and immerse you inside the game. Reverting to Spotify, to me, is like switching the audio off in a movie to listen toyour favorite playlist. A little counter-productive and excessive  and I say that as a paying Spotify customer.But, we are all unique in our opinions, andGustav Sderstrm, Chief Product Officer at Spotify, isin the other camp.Music has always been a big part of gaming,he said in a statement. I remember playing computer games like Quake and Counter-Strike with my favorite tunes on in the background  taking the experience to a whole new level. With todays launch, were bringing back that magic of gaming with music  all in a beautifully designed and smooth experience that looks great on the big screen.Each to their own thenThis partnership with Sony is another example of Spotifys desireto go beyondcatering to your music needs on mobile and desktop and instead be the soundtrack to your life. The Swedish company teamed up with Uber last year to let passengers pick their music while they ride, and gaming is another area where it was inclined to make its presence felt.The alliance is also a sensible one for Sony, which closed its struggling Music Unlimited service in favor of working with Spotify.Its chief console gaming rival, Microsoft (Xbox), has its own music streaming service, so it isnt a huge surprise to see Sony align itselfwith one of the biggest names in the streaming game.
