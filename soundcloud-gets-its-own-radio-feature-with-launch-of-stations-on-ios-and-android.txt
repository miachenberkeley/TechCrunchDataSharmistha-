With opportune timing, given Apples decision to put its curated iTunes Radiostations behind a paywall,music streaming serviceSoundCloud today launched its own take on continuous, lean-back listening with the debut of Stations. Similar to other radio services, like Pandora, Stations allow users to listen to an endless stream of music based on a track, search terms, or other content stream.The idea, the company explains in its announcement, is to offer a new way to discover the tracks youve never heard anywhere else by making it easier to find other music thats related to your Likes on its service.SoundCloud alreadyunderstood the relationships and similarities between songs, which it highlighted through its Related Tracks feature, but it had yetto take advantage of that data to offer a more simplified listening experience. That made using SoundCloud to find new music that fit your interests more difficult  and thats a problem for a service thats known to bea place to discover emerging or under-the-radar talent.The feature has long beenone of users biggest requests. Before today, discovering new songs actually involved a fair amount of work.To create your first SoundCloud station, users will pull up a menu after searching for a term, track, content stream, or your Collection, and then tap the Start Station option. Afterwards, that Station will remain a part of your Collection, along with your Likes and Playlists. The company also notes that there are today over 100 million tracks on itsservice to choose from.The launch of Stations comes at a time when SoundCloud is trying to figure out ways to monetize its business. The company raised some 32 million in debt financing dating back toearly 2015, and confirmed more recently that it plans to roll out paid subscriptions and advertising across its global markets later this year.Of course, before SoundCloud can charge for a premium tier, it needs toestablish a baseline service where its at least on par with the rest of the streaming music market. That could certainly include a radio feature like Stations  something that Pandora, Apple Music, Spotify, Play Music, and others,offer.SoundCloud says the Stations feature is live now on both its iOS and Android applications.
