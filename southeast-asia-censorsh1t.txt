With a growing middle class rising up across its population of more than 600 million people, Southeast Asia is truly a growth market. Added to that, the influx of mobile devices bringing Internet to hundreds of millions of people for the first  and putting it right in their pocket, no less  makes it a particularly exciting place for technology, which has the potential to be hugely transformative.Unfortunately, while tech may be blazing a trailthat includes improvingcommunications, increasing access to resources, makingpayment methods more robust and more, attitudes across the region can be major hurdles that hinder development. Particularly from governments and other authorities.To make that point clear, three prominent and very different examples of censorship from countries across the region made headlines last week.Indonesia grabbedthe somewhat unwanted accolade of becoming the first country to block Netflix following its monster 130 country expansion announced in early January.Telekom Indonesia blocked the service from all of its platforms last week, according to the Jakarta Post. While the government distanced itself from involvement, the state-run mobile operators concern focused around Netflixs ability to run violent and adult content without adhering to content moderation regulations in the country, which has the worlds largest Muslim population.The company also lacks a permit to do business in Indonesia  a problem that Uber and local rival Grab know well enough  which was cited as another reason. So, if you think challenges with licensing in your country are responsible for Netflix running a small library of content, imagine what its like in Indonesia where a lack of paperwork is responsible for switching off access to the service in its entirety for users.For a reminder of how random/unclear bans can be in Indonesia, refer to motorbike taxi services, which were blocked then unblocked during a 24-hour period last month.Example two comes from Malaysia, where Medium was blocked for carrying an investigative reportdelving into corruptionclaims relatedtoPrime MinisterNajib.The media outlet Sarawak Report  regularly publishes stories on Medium because its website is already blocked in Malaysia, but itslatest report appeared to be enough to push authorities to take action. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission contacted Medium asking that the post be removed for being false, unsubstantiated, misleading, and in violation of the written law of Malaysia.Medium stood firm, however, claiming that it stands by the report and investigative journalism generally.Mediums in no position to evaluate the truth of the Sarawak Reports Medium post. Weve received no evidence that the post violates any of our Rules, or any law, the company wrote in a blog post.Since it uses HTTPS to secure its site, Malaysian authorities were left with the choice of leaving the post as it is, since Medium wouldnt remove it, or blocking the website entirely. It look the latter choice, so now the publishing platform is no longer available in the country. Quite absurd.Exhibit three comes from Thailand, where the government which came to power viaa military coup in 2014  ispressuring leading Internet companies Google, Facebook and chat app Line, which has over 30 million users in the country, to censor content on their services.Thailand has cracked down hard on dissenting voices online since the coup  last week a politician was arrested for sharing a video mocking junta leader (and Prime Minister) Prayuth Chan-ocha  and it is reported to be developing a single internet gateway. If deployed, such a system would allow authorities to directly control the availability of online content without needing to liaise with mobile operators, ISPs or Internet companies like Google, Facebook and Line.The Internet has the potential to positively impact life in this vibrant part of the world, but these three examples  and there are countless that are thrown up each week  show the kind of challenges that push back on progress.
