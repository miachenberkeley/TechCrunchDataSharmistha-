Snapchat just rolled out an update that lets users decorate their Snaps with the 200+ stickers they released aspart of Chat 2.0.The new feature worksexactly like emojis  they even live inside the same button on the camera screen. Just like the emoji feature you can drag, resize and reposition any sticker on your photos or videos. The stickers even work with Snapchats new 3D Sticker feature.While not technically a new feature, the update will certainly help users better communicate their thoughts and emotions via Snaps.Unlike emojis, the stickers arent sorted into different categories  they all are inside one long scroll list. Andbecause this list doesnt have the same sticker search capabilities that Chat has, it may be hard to find the exact sticker you want to use.Another potential issue is thatsomeof the stickers are better suited to be sent in chat instead of adorned on a photo or video. While most users put emojis on their content as a decoration (like adding a hat or sunglasses to a selfie), these stickers will probably be used in a different way.Notably, this isnt the only news to come out of Snapchat HQ today. This morning the company replaced all of its ultra-popular Lenses with nine different X-Men themed sponsored Lenses.Normally Snapchat will addsponsored Lensesto the front of the lineup, but still leavesnon-sponsored ones (which are normally more popular with users). This is the first time they have ever totally removed the regular ones. While the X-Men ones are certainly well-made, they hamper the creativity of users who rely on the rest to express themselves to friends on the platform.The decision to remove the beloved Lenses isnt sitting well with users, and was an irresponsible decision for a company that is trying to prove to users it wont sacrifice its core experience for the benefit of corporate sponsors. And while this move will only last 24 hours, it says exactly the opposite  that short-term financial gains are more important than keeping users happy.The new sticker feature is live now with updates available in the iOS App Store and Google PlayStore, and the X-Men Lenses are already live in the app, if youfeel like checking them out.
