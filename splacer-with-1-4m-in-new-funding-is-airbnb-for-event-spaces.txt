Splacer, the Tel Aviv-based marketplace for listing and renting out creative event space, today announced that it has raised $1.4 million in seed funding led by Carmel Ventures. A number of angel investors, including Shlomo Kramer, Sam Ben Avraham, and Eyal Shaked, also participated in the round,Alongside the funding announcement, Splacer is also going live with a beta product in New York City.What Airbnb does for longer-term stays in a home, Splacer does for short-term event spaces. Users can list personal or commercial space, set prices, and users can rent them out for different types of events.The company was founded in Tel Aviv by architects Lihi Gerstner and Adi Biran, and launched in the fall of 2014. Splacer has since grown to have over 100 event spaces listed in Israel, and is launching with 70 spaces listed in New York City.The Splacer founders told TechCrunch that the platform isnt meant for big parties, though of course that will likely end up being a minor use case. Rather, Splacers predominant use cases thus far have been company off-sites, photo shoots, and art exhibitions.Not all spaces are approved to be on the network, as the company wants to curate the assortment of spaces listed in the marketplace. Users can rent spaces both by the hour or by the day. Plus, users are offered a network of service providers, ranging from caterers to musicians to photographers (and even aerial dancers), so that they can plan the entirety of an event through a single portal.So far, Splacer has worked with companies like Facebook, Fiverr, Outbrain, and Playbuzz (among others) in Tel Aviv to offer creative spaces for corporate events
