Spotify, which last week announced60 million users (15 million paying) worldwide, is announcing an upgrade to its Windows Phone app that it hopes will getmore ownersof Microsoft-powered mobile phones to use its streaming music service. The new app featuresa slicker-looking black-colored theme, alongside (finally) the appearance of SpotifysYour Music feature to let users save albums and tracks to their collections, as well as its updated Browse feature.Our new design makes accessing your favourite music smoother than ever before. The new dark theme and refined interface lets the content come forward and pop, just like in a cinema when you dim the lights, the company notes in a blog post.Meanwhile, the Browse feature  which was first launched way back in 2013  sees Spotify delivering even more relevant and localised content, which tapsinto the trend among music services to beever more sophisticated, personalizing music to specific moments and places where you are.Microsofts Windows Phone mobile platform often plays second fiddle to Android and iOS when it comes to developers creating and updating apps  with the common refrain being that there are not enough users of those devices to merit the investment needed to develop for it.Its unclear, in that regard, what motivated Spotify to upgrade this app now. (We askedif there was a financial incentive to do so; the answer was no.) Spotify launched its first Windows app back in 2010 but it took until 2013 to update that to Windows Phone 8.Suffice it to say that for Spotify subscriberswho already use the iOS or Android apps, this latest upgrade to the WP app is about getting more parity with those other two, more popular platforms.That said, Spotifys competitors Rdio and Deezer have given love to Windows Phone andthat may be one reason why the music streaming company will continue to pursue users on that platform, as part of its bigger strategy to be available to anyone who wants to use it.There likelyis a biggerreason for why Spotify would be interested in at last updating its Windows Phone app.Some 52% of all listening on Spotify now happens on mobile and tablet devices  meaning that Spotify is effectively a mobile-first company.Thathelps the company generate more revenues, since you need to pay for subscriptions to access all music features on these devices. And givenSpotify isamong those reportedly interested in filing for an IPO soon, its no surprise to see itupdating apps across all mobile platforms to drive this trend further.
