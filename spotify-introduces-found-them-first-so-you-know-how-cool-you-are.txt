The definition for hipster is ever-evolving, but I have one go-to tell to determine whether or not someone is a real hipster. If a sick tune comes on, and you hear I listened to this before it was cool, chances are youre in the presence of a true hipster.And today, Spotify has introduced a feature that will let you know whether you yourself are a hipster who listened to an artist before they were cool.The tool is called Found them first and its a simple web page that lets you log in through Spotify to find out, based on your listening history, which big-name artists you discovered early on.Because Im so cool, Ive discovered approximately zero new artists.But alas! Theres hope for me yet.Whether youre an artisan in finding up-and-coming artists or a tried and true Britney Spears fan like myself, Spotify provides a playlist of new, relatively unheard-of artists tailored to your listening preferences.Its a cute little feature, and could help folks add a little edge to their music library.
