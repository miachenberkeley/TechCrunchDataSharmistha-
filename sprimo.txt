Weve written about a number of air purifiersbefore, but Sprimo is taking a different approach  instead of trying to clean all the air in the room, it creates a personalized stream of clean air for individual users.Now, a phrase like personalized stream of clean air might sound a little silly, but CEO Ray Combs and CTO Harold Han (who has a Ph.D. in chemistry from New York University) convinced me that if youre going to buy an air purifier, Sprimo could be an efficient and affordable alternative.After all, they said that only 1 percent of the air from whole room purifiers actually reaches you, making the personalized approach 10 times more efficient. Plus, itallows for things like temperature to be tailored to your preferences.Have you ever gotten in someones car and adjusting the air vents is the first thing you do? Combs said. We all have a perception of what we want our air to feel like.The filters are customizable based on your needs, say if you have a particular problem with pollen or live in a city where theres a high concentration of a certainchemical. Combs said Sprimo can get smarter about this over time, because it will analyze the used filters that customers send in through the filter exchange program.Sprimo is currently crowdfunding on Crowd Supply, with a pre-order price of $319.
