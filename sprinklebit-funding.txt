SprinkleBit, a startup that helps you invest with guidance from friends and experts, has raised $10 million in new funding from GTC.Its not a new idea to tap into the wisdom of the crowd to do better on the stock market, but SprinkleBit offers a unique tool called the Value Prediction Index, or VPI  each stock gets scored based on whether the community thinks its price will increase, and each user gets scored based on how accurately they predict future prices. (The VPI is actually based on CEO Alexander Wallins undergraduate research at UCSD.)While the VPI is maybe the most interesting thing about SprinkleBits approach, the startupsbuilt a fullsocial platform, where users can trade risk-free with SprinkleBucks and follow other users trades. Then, if they feel like putting actual money on the line, they can switch to SprinkleBits brokerage mode and buy and sell stocks for real. (Wallin said that with the combination of social investing and real trading, his team hadto do a lot of work to make sure SprinkleBit is compliant with FINRA regulations.)Theres also an educational component  the company offers a set of online investing tutorials called SprinkleBit University.You can use SprinkleBits social side for free, but it charges an $8 commission on trades. You can also pay $9.95 a month for SprinkleBit Premium, which cuts the commission to $5 and includes additional data and tools.As for how the broader turmoil in the stock market might might affect usage, he said, I think its a good time, because when the market is going well, its all about greed, and any platform will make money  Now, when you have to actually know which stocks are going to go up, you need a tool [like this].SprinkleBit has raised a total of $13.5 million. Its also in the process of relocating its headquarters from San Diego to New York City.
