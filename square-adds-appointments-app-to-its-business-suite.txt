Piece by piece, Square is trying to provide all of the tools that businesses need to manage themselves. They have the payment processing part down, a payroll product, real-time analytics and now a way to manage appointments.The company says that millions of appointments have been made through Square since the products launch last August and this new app for iOS will allow businesses to manage those appointments from anywhere. Any business thats already using Squares appointment software is going to appreciate it.Breaking out each of these components into apps is smart, because Square can iterate on each without having to touch the other.Being able to access everything without sitting down at a computer sounds like the norm for consumers, but not so much for businesses. Most of the software that does the things Squares tackling is clunky and certainly doesnt have accompanying mobile apps.
