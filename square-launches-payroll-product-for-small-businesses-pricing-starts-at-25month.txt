Mobile payment startup Square has been gradually building out the products it offers to small businesses to position itself asa one-stop shop for their variousfront-of-house and back-office needs. Today sees the latestdevelopment on that theme: the company has launched Square Payroll, software for businesses to pay and track taxes and other costsfor both hourly and salaried employees. The product, initially available only in California, is priced at $20 per month, with $5 per employee on top of that.Square Payrollis out officially today, butits been in testing for a while: it was spotted as far back as last September, being tested at a price point of $10/month among select businesses in California.Thelive product will also be available only in California at launch, but the plan is to expand it to more states soon.In terms of payroll software, Square is positioning itself  at least for now  as a fairly simple product (those line drawings in the video below are not misleading).Square Payroll isentering a pretty crowded market, competing against the likes of Intuits Quick Books, ADP, Paychex and others. A few, like Wave Accounting, offer some but not all the same features: Wave, for example,doesnt handle tax payments or tax filings  they estimated tax liabilities. It is also less expensive. Itstarts with two base tiers of $10 and $15 plus $4 per each employee.Square Payroll includes timecards, taxes, and the ability to track and pay both salaried and hourly workers, and its price is all-in.Its a smart idea and there are a couple of clear advantages forSquare to build and offer a payroll product.For current customers, it becomes one more way for Square to tie them to its service, and to make more margin out of those users (important since payments alone area very thin-margin service when you consider the other parties in the chain that also take cuts).Its also a way of potentially snagging new customers for the startup, which is currently one of the leaders in its category but competing strongly against the likes of PayPal and others.Other services and productsthat Square has rolled out to service small businesses beyond basic payments and hardware to take payments include Square Cash for cash advances,Square Capital for financing, appointments scheduling, analytics, online stores, preordering and more.Square itself is also going through an interesting time. Its co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, is nowputting in some moonlighting hours as the interim CEO at Twitter  a job some believe hes angling to take on permanently, which could leave Square out of shape for a while.All the more reason to add some reinforcements to the platform by way of a new service, and to keep pressing ahead with its growth.Squares video on how Payroll works is below:
