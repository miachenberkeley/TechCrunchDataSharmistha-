Square made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange this morningwith a little pop. Trading as $SQ, the payments company opened at $11.20 per shareand continuedclimbing. Last night the companypriced its IPO at $9, an offering that raised$243 million and valuedthe company at around $2.9 billion.Its a positive sign for Square after a few blows in the lead-up to today. Last year, the companyraised a round at a $6 billion valuation. But for its IPO, it first projected a range of $11 to 13 per share, which would only value the company at a little more than $4 billion. The $9 per share IPO was a further conservative turn.Square helped put the whole business of mobile payments on the map with its charismatic CEO Jack Dorsey (whos dividing histime between Square andhis new-ish role as CEO of Twitter), while products like its smartphone dongle and stand can feel ubiquitous at times. However, the companys consumer-facing services dont seem to have taken off, and its facing increasing competition from other point-of-sale services.Square itself is not profitable, with its filings showing wideninglosses  most recently a net loss of a net loss of $54 millionon revenue of $332 million in the third quarter of this year.As of 11:01am Eastern, the stock wastrading at $13.60 per share, up 51 percent from its IPO price. Even without the pop, Dorsey probably got points with his mom Marcia Dorsey  she rang the opening bell. She was joined by Cheri Mims, owner of Lilybelle (one of the first businesses to accept payments via Square), and Squares College Code Camp participants Terri Burns and Jackie Luo.
