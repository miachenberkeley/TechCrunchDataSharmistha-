Square says some of the functions being given a home in St. Louis is Compliance Operations, Customer Support, IT Tech, Recruiting and Office Experience. Its as good a spot as any to tap into the midwest. Its not a bad place to nab talent from local universities, either. The city is pretty excited to have Square come to town, as well.Anyone who has followed Jack Dorseys story knows how much he cares about his native St. Louis. He participated in rallies in Ferguson.And we walk. #handsupdontshoot https://t.co/ah4z98InGW Jack (@jack) August 16, 2014At one point, it was rumored that Dorsey had been arrested. He wasnt. But he tweeted and shared during a good chunk of the start of the marches. Now he gets to take his company, one of them anyways, back home. With a rumored run to go public sometime this year, Dorsey appears to be engaged as one can be when theyre the temporary CEO at another company.
