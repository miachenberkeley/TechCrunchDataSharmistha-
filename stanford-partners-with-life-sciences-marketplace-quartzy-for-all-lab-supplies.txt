Quartzy is a lab suppliesmarketplace often used among life scientists at various universities, but particularlyatStanford. The academic institutionmade that relationship official today. Quartzy will now be deployed in labs across the Stanford campusto save the university cash on lab supplies.The Quartzy marketplace launched out of Y Combinator four years backto provide an easier way for scientists to price-compare life science tools and equipment. Co-foundersAdam Regelmann and Jayant Kulkarni met while conducting their own lab research at Columbia University.The two noticed a lack of supply-chain and management tools to make the lab process more efficient.Quartzy uses a bidding platform to help scientists find less expensive products from competing suppliers.The startup also provides lab-management tools that aim to make neworders easy when supplies get low.It also helps labs avoid sticky regulations.The United States federal government requires two quotes for items that cost more than $3,000.The Quartzy bidding platform automatically generates competitive quotes from multiple suppliers that will hopefully savelabs money withoutwasting time getting those quotes.Quartzy believes it can save Stanford $15 million out of a $100 million estimated annual lab supplies spend with the new partnership. However, the startup wont make money on saving money for the academic institution. Instead, suppliers pay a commission to Quartzy on products purchased. Commissions are the same rate for each supplier so there isnt a bias for certain suppliers over others, according to Kulkarni.There isnt much competition in the space, either. Science Exchangehelps labs save money byprovidingoutsourcing of the experiments rather than tools for your own lab use.HappiLabs provides price comparison forlab supplies as well, but charges for the lab shopping consultants starting at $250 per month.More than 10,000 labs and many major academic institutions now use the price-comparison service to save, including Duke, Harvard, MIT and now campus-wide atStanford.We expect to reach critical mass on the supplier-side with this addition of demand generated by Stanford, Kulkarni told TechCrunch. This will make the platform and the marketplace more valuable to other labs and jump-start our adoption at other large institutions across the U.S.
