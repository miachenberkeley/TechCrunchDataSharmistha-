Do you like Star Wars? Do you like virtual reality? The Venn diagram of those two fan bases presumably has quite the overlap  and yet, there hasnt been much official Star Wars VR stuff to date.Thats about to change.Lucasfilm, FX powerhouse Industrial Light & Magic, and Skywalker Sound have just teamed up to announce a new endeavor: the ILM Experience Lab  a team brought together almost solely to tackle the budding world of VR.With those three names being thrown around, you might expect some Star Wars-related content to be a focus  and sure enough, USA Today reports that Star Wars VR content is priority No. 1.The video below gives but a few glimpses into what theyve cooked up so far:Like the VR community itself, ILM hardly seems committed to any one VR solution at this point. At least based on that video, it seems theyre dabbling with everything from HTCs Vive, to the Oculus Rift, to insane, projection-based, Holodeck-style full room experiences.Hell, even if youre not into VR, the video is worth it just for a glimpse at the sort of toys this group has at their disposal. I mean, check out that friggin real time, simulated-camera motion capture at the 30-second mark. Drool.
