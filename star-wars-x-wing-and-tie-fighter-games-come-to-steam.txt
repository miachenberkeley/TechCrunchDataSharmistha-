Well its essentially Star Wars time, with May the 4th in sight and the new movie set for launch later this year  and it probably wont not be Star Wars time ever again if Disney has its way. To celebrate, Steam is hosting a big Star Wars Day sale, with discounts on classic games, and debuting the X-Wing and TIE Fighter series on its platform.Space dogfight simulators all, the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games spanned the 90s, giving the Best Decade plenty of fantasy realization fun for kids who grew up wishing they could don orange or black jumpsuits and light up the inky blackness of space with either red or green laser fire. The entire X-Wing series, which includes TIE Fighter and crossover titles, is available for 10 percent off during the duration of this sale.Other Star Wars games are also on sale, including hits like Battlefront II, Empire at War, the Knights of the Old Republic series, the Jedi Knight games, Dark Forces and many, many more. You can pick up a choice section of 14 titles total for 77 percent off in honor of the so-called Star Wars day, too, so basically you should be able to play Star Wars video games straight from now until December 18 when The Force Awakens hits theaters.Of course, you may have already picked up the classic X-Wing series when GOG.com made it available late last year, but if Star Wars is good at just one thing, its making sure fans re-purchase content over and over again for multiple platforms in multiple formats until the end of time.
