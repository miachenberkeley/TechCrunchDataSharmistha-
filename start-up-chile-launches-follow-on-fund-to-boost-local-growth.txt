Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.Shortly after launching Start-Up Chile, the state-backed accelerator programdesigned to spur the development of astartup ecosystem in Chile, the Chilean government realized they had a problem on their hands. The program was running smoothly, but adearth of local investors was drivinga good portion of its graduates to a premature death.Five years later, Start-Up Chile has devised a solution to this problem it will fund the startups itself, through a follow-on fund launching today calledStart-Up Chile SCALE.Start-Up Chile has graduatedover 1000 startupsfrom its accelerator program that offers entrepreneurs $40k in equity-free financing to temporarily relocate to Santiago, Chile. These companieshave gone on to raise hundreds of millions in follow-on funding, generating a massive amount of press for the program and for Chiles budding tech scene.But the projecthas faced its fair share ofchallenges. You can relocatehundreds ofinternational entrepreneurs to Chile, fly in dozens of experienced mentors, and hand outstacks of government money to everyone, but buildinga startup ecosystem from scratch takes time.Thats why we created the SCALE fund, says Sebastian Vidal, director of Start-Up Chile. 85% of the funds that Start-Up Chile companies have raised  which is like 110 million so far  is capital from abroad, the majority from the States.For startups based in Chile, its difficult to find early stage capital to sustain a businessthats not yet profitable. Latin America is home to a different breed of venture investor than your typical Silicon Valley seed fund these guys tend toexpectan unrealistic demonstration of traction before theyll placeabeton a young company. As a result, startupsoften jump ship after completing the program in Chile,resuming operationsin the U.S. or Europe where obtaining morecash isnt such a challenge.Through the follow-on fund, Start-Up Chile will offer 60 million Chilean pesos (about $100k USD) in new financing to three graduates per batch of 30 upon completion of the three-month program. Just like the accelerator, the SCALE funding is equity-free.Of course, theres a catch  the money will be given through a co-financed grant, in which the $100k will account for 70% of the total funding and the recipient of the grant must put up the remaining 30%.The startups need to figure out a way of finding that capital, that 30%, says Vidal. The people in the industry that weve talked with are really comfortable with that model.And the second condition? The company must incorporate in Chile, and plan to stick around for a while.We never talk about Chile as a final market, because its not big enough, says Vidal. What we sell is that Chile is a great platform to start, to test, and to grow from. The political sphere is stable, the economy is stable, all of the legal things actually work, the regulations are friendly so if you can set operations in Chile and grow from Chile, it will be easy for you to grow in the rest of Latin America or abroad.This is a model that anumberof countrieshave sought to replicate.Start-Up Chiles directorshave worked with the organizers ofStart-Up Brasil, Start-Up Per, and Malaysias MaGIC, sharinga playbook theyve created with any countries that are interested.Governments move in herds  they try to follow each other, theyre not risk takers, says Torsten Kolind, CEO of YouNoodle, the startup competition platform thats been running Start-Up Chiles application process from day one.Start-Up Chile was the first of its kind back in 2010, but Kolind has seen a recent uptake in government-backedprograms joining YouNoodles platform, aiming to replicate the success of the Chilean model.Theres a recent wave of government now that finally seems to get that a startup ecosystem may hold the key to long term national development, saysKolind.And this is arguably the strongestevidenceofStart-Up Chiles success  its still working out the kinks in Chile, but in the meantimeitscatalyzed a Startup Nation movementacross the globe.
