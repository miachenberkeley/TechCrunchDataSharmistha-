Anonymous Twitter persona Startup L. Jackson has captured a large following in the tech community due to hisbiting commentary on Silicon Valley cultureand regular startup advice.Weve made our guesses about who he is, but were still not sure.Product Hunts Ryan Hoover and Erik Torenberg interviewed the man behind the mysteryfor their podcast and agreed to let us post it on TechCrunch. The two edited the interview and masked his voice to protect his identity, but it could still shed some light on who he is.Startup L. Jackson mentions in the interview that hesflattered that we reported on semantic analysis linking his account to Svbtle founder Dustin Curtis, but swears thats not him.From the podcast we get a few nuggets of information about him, however: We learn thathe was at a startup when he first made the profile in 2011; ispassionate about diversity in tech; reads Techmeme every morning; uses WeChat; and is onLinkedIn, but doesnt listen toSpotify.He mentions people like Ben Horowitz, Sheryl Sandberg and Dave McClure in the podcast. Anyone of themcould be him. Or not.Finally, we learn that SLJs identity is an open secret with some of the Silicon Valley digerati. At least two-dozen people are aware of his real identity, he says, although they have remained relatively tight-lipped to date.Were still hoping to find out who he is, and would like to buy him a drink some day. Then again, who knows? Maybe we already have.
