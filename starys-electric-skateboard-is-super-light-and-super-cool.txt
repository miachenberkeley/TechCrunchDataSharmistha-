Electric skateboards are cool  thats official but they come ten-a-penny these days.If you want to find a good one, China is the place to look.But dont worry, we went there and did the searching for you.At our TechCrunch Beijing eventearlier this month, I hung out with the team from Stary, a very cool company from Shanghai. Rex Chen, the companys CEO, took some time out of the show to give us a demonstration of Starys board  which raised a hugely impressive $740,000 on Kickstarter earlier this year.Not only is the Stary board quick with atop speed of18.6 MPH  but it is seriously, seriously light thanks to a battery that is stashed inside the board itself, and a motor subtly built into one of the rear wheels. Did I mention a handheld control which  thankfully for those with as little skill as me  includes a brake?All of thiscombines to makeone of the least assuming motorized skateboards in the world.Good news: if you missed the Kickstartercampaign and like the look of the board, you can go ahead and order one from Stary.io, where they are selling for $899.Fair warning though, itwont ship until March 2016  but, if youre into skating, its pretty darn cool and worth the wait.
