State lawmakers and the District of Columbia have put together a group of bills pushing for legislationto protect our digital privacy. The coalition of 16 states and D.C. say surveillance technology and a lack of regulation has given Big Brother too much power when it comes tomonitoring online information.A bipartisan consensus on privacy rights is emerging, and now the states are taking collective action where Congress has been largely asleep at the switch, ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero wrote in a blog post about the move to truncate monitoring of online activity. This movement is about seizing control over our lives. Everyone should be empowered to decide who has access to their personal information.It should come as no surprise that privacy advocates such as Edward Snowden are also in favor of an overhaul to digital privacy laws.It's time.

Any change in the law in these states would affect 100 million Americans.
