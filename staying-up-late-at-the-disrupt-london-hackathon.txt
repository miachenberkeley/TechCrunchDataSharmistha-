Dropping by the Disrupt London hackathon at around midnight, we expected to see many participants losing energy or flat-out asleep  and understandably so. Instead, almost everyone remained appallingly friendly, enthusiastic and eager to talk about their projects.We hate to pick favorites, especially since the judges will be making their own decisions in just a few hours. So our hats go off to each team (including the one building an Internet-connected sombrero) planning to power through till morning  particularly the ones who put up with our increasingly inebriated and off-topic questions.Tickets to Disrupt London are still available and can be purchased here.
