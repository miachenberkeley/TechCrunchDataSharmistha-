Stellar, theStripe-backedopen-source payment network, has launched its first major integration in the form of a partnership with Oradian, a company that sellscloud-based software tomicro finance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries.As a refresher, Stellar is a non-profit foundation with the goal of connecting different financial systems around the world. Startedbythe original creatorof Mt. Gox, Stellar first launched byopenly distributingLumens (the platforms digital currency) to anyone that signed up online.However, the platform has since shifted its focus onto facilitating the exchange of existing currencies, essentially becoming an open-source SWIFT.For its first real-world test, Stellar decided to tackle a very real problem  money transfer in rural Nigeria. Today, thefoundation announced the launch of a new payment-transfer network insideOradian, built on top of Stellars platform.By integratingtheStellar platform into their core software, Oradian willallow 300,000 Nigerians to cheaply transfer money between MFIs over the Stellar network.Joyce Kim,Executive Director of Stellar, explained that the partnership will bring the first live money transfer network to Nigeria. With the Oradian integration, communities that primarily relied upon cash for money transfer in and out of their villages can now transfer money instantly and safely, regardless of their location.A Map ofall MFI branches participating in thelaunch of the new programSo why Nigeria? The foundation explained that Nigeria not only has the largest economy in Africa, but also has the largest population. But, despite these numbers, the nation remains economically isolated from the rest of the world.So while the program is initially focused on transmitting money within the country, its eventual goal is to allow safeand affordable remittance across borders, all on top of the Stellar network.
