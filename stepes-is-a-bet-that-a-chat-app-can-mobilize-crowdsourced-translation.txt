Mobile messaging is eating the world. So it follows thatmobile messaging interfaces will eatUI design. To wit: meet Stepes, a chat-based translation app created by veteran software localization company CSOFT.For chat-based read: it has a mobile messaging style UI. (For another recent example of messaging interface appropriate see also: Dojo-Labs.)CSOFT is drawing on its 10 years+ of translation services expertise, including a crowdsourced glossary for industry/topic specific nomenclature, called TermWiki, which it launched around four years ago, and the circa 50,000 translators already on its books.So Stepes is not a typical startup, but rather a new ventureby an old (in tech terms) translation software companydrawing onsome up-to-the-minute app interface trends to tacklea specific problem.That problem? How to deliver translation services via smartphone  and thereby unlock a potentially massivemarket of bi/multilingual people to grow the number of translators available for on-demand translation work (and thereby grow the overall size of the translation pie).Instead of Stepes just being targeted atthe circa 250,000 professional translators it says are currently working in the field,CSOFT is eyeing up something like half the worlds population (aka the total number of bi/multilingual people) as potential users of itsapp.So yeah, pretty ambitious stuff.Yetlook at the hundreds of millions of users mobile messaging platformslike WhatsApp have managed to acquireand you can see thelogic.Thinking being: you dont have to be a pro translator to be able to apply language skills to translate a few snippets of text if you have a bit of downtime and your phone to hand. As many people surely do.Making an app thats easy enough for anyone who can speak more than one language to use to translate text on-demand is why theyfixed on usinga mobile messaging interface,says Carl Yao, Stepes VP of global strategy and development. The app also supports text to speech, so users do not necessary even need to be able to type to take a translation job on the platform.On the demand side, CSOFTs rationalis there are plenty of smaller businesses that would like to be able to localize their content  if only it didnt cost so much time and money to do so.Translation is still too expensive, and is too difficult to get Because Stepes is making the whole translation process so much easier we think its going to unlock this whole pent-up demand for translation, he argues.CSOFT started work on Stepes aroundMarch this year, settling on using amobile messaging interface several months in  after trying to figure out how to make the translation workflow viable on mobile devices. Translating large amounts of text on a small screen demands a bite-sized approach, reckonsYao, whilemaking translation more accessible generally means simplifying the tools.All the previous translation software is mostly desktop-based, which means theyre not available on a mobile. Not only that, a lot of the software tools are becoming increasingly difficult to use because of the [html] tag manipulations [and other text formatting requirements] Its really making the translation process very difficult for just anybody, he says.Stepes makes translation available on mobile for the first time and makes the whole translation task very easy  so that we think is a big, new advancement [It] makes the translatable text just like what you normally see in a chat message  just the straightforward sentence, no tags to worry about.It took a long time to figure it out, he adds. We were thinking that the fact that nobody type long emails on their mobile Same thing nobody writes dissertations on their mobile. So thats why a lot of these other translation software companies just dont bother with mobile  they think it cant be done. So we had to address that issue and come up with a viable solution to make sure that this whole translation experience is good and is efficient.CSOFT has filed multiple patents to try to defend its approach here, including for the apps swipe gestures  that let users move between a messaging bubble showing the current sentence theyre translating to view thattext within the context of the surrounding sentences in the document(swiping the other way to see the proximatesentencestheyve already translated) so the overall translation quality does not end up chopped into little pieces too.Mobile suddenly makes the whole translation process very intuitive, argues Yao. And very efficient.Stepes is launching today on Android, with an iOS app due shortly  its currently in review with Apple. A Windows version is also planned for the future.As with existing translation business models, the pricing for translations is aperword model. Per word rates will vary depending on factors like the target language and subject field, with Yao saying they might range from 3c to 10c per word. They will also vary depending on how long a translator has been working via the platform, with better rates for peoplewho clock more years translating via Stepes.How will Stepes ensure quality translations, given its opening up its platform to anyone who claims to speak another language, not just to professional translators? As with other on-demand approaches theres a built in review system  so translators are rated on every job they complete, helping to surface better translators on the platform.This is almost like crowdpolicing. If you dont do a good job you will be ranked very low Stepes linguists are going to really be paying attention to everything they submit because they know they are ranked, and the translation will have their identity connected to it. If they dont do a good job they will be ranked low  whether there is translation accuracy or slow performance, not on time performance, so that itself we think its a very important driving factor for improved quality, he says.Yao also argues that opening up to non-professional translators who might be subject matter experts in certain other fields they might be a professional engineer or doctor, for example  will also help raise quality of translations whenhaving that specific expert knowledge mightbehelpful to a specifictranslation task.The users will understand the subject matter better than the professional translator, he argues. (Although it remains to be seen how many doctors/engineers have time/incentive to do small-time translationjobs in their spare time  presumably as many as have time to be Uber drivers outside work hours)While CSOFT ishoping to push Stepesto the 50,000 professional translators it already has on its books, itwill also be doing some pre-screening of new sign-ups  including a screen translation test  again with an eye on quality. The platform will also have ongoing selective reviews, wherea translation can beautomatically reviewed by a second translator in a professional category, says Yao.Translators will be paid for completed translation jobs via an in-app wallet  with various transfer options such as the ability to withdraw to PayPal. While customers paying to have documentstranslated via Stepes will be able to log into a desktop version of the platform to see their translation happening in real time (if theyre curious).Of course there are plenty of free onlinemachine translation apps out there  such as Google Translate  but Yao says the company is not concerned about competition from algorithms, given thatso much of translation requires cultural background for nuanced context, and also because there are so many languages where machine translation doesnt even exist yet (he notes there are 26 languages just in India, for instance).And Stepes target small business customer base wontwant topushpoor quality translations attheir customers. In other words,never aska machine to translate your document when you can crowdsourcea human to do it instead.Im very confident [that machine translation will not get good enough to destroy a crowdsourced translation business] One of the biggest challenge with machine translation is first of all you have to have enough data, he says.[But] having more data to a certain extent is not going to help you with the quality anymore. Because data gets contaminated. And machine translations number one enemy is the contamination. Because the machine translator doesnt know whether this is right or wrong.So thats why its next to impossible, at least for the immediate future, that a machine will ever be able to match human translation.
