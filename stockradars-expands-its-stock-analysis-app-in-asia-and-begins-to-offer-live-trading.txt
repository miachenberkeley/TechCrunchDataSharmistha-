Its product is at the cutting-edge, having recently enabled instant trading inside its app, butfinancial barriers arent just being pushed in Western markets.StockRadars, a Thailand-based service providing mobile-based analytics and insight for trading, just followed Robinhoods lead and enabled real-time stock trading inside its app for the first time. That live-trading feature is limited to Thailand for now, but the company hasexpanded its analytics service to eight new countries China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, India and Singapore with a view to rolling real-time tradingout in these places, too.To help that regional push, Siam Squared, the company behind StockRadars, hasclosed new funding which was announced at a press event today.The round is undisclosed, but TechCrunch understands from a source close to the deal that it is $700,000. StockRadars raised $800,000 last year and this latest round is a bridge towards a larger raise later this year.This latestround is led by JapansCyber Agent Ventures, an existing investor, and it includesparticipation from a number of angel investors, including prominent stock traders in Bangkok. That, SiamSquared founderTeerachart Max Kortrakul told TechCrunch, is an important validation from the market and likely to be strategic as the startup pushes to democratize stock investing in Thailand and Asia.Our technology and app has always helped people get ahead by analyzing stock performance, but now we offer the complete solution for investment, he added.The StockRadarappfor iOS and Android allows users to track and analyze public stock.Users can pay for radars, which are essentially layers of intelligence and analysis that help identifybest performing stocks and investment opportunities.Southeast Asias fintech space is emerging with potential, anchored by Singapore, the regions hub for finance and startup investment. Trade Hero is arguably the biggest fish, having raised $10 million, but others outsideof the stock investment vertical include social payments firm Fastacash, which closed a $15 million Series Blast year, and payment enablers 2C2P and Omisewhich have each raised multiple millions from investors.Updated to correct Fastcashs round, which was a Series B not Series A.
