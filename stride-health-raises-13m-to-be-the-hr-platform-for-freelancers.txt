Looking to provide health insurance to the 53 million Americans who dont get benefits from their employers,Stride Healthhas raised$13 million in new funding.Venrock led the Series A round, with participation from Fidelity Biosciences and previousinvestor NEA, which brings Strides total venture funding to $17.5 million.For the freelancers and independent contractorswhomake up one third of the U.S. labor force, Stride offers a hassle-free alternative to Healthcare.gov.After youenter yourowndata, includingage, gender, location, and illness history,Strides forecasting model evaluates how much care youlluse throughout the year, pricesit on every health plan, and couples it with the coverage price to show you the total cost of each plan.Whereas Healthcare.gov takes the average user well over an hour to register for a health plan, Stride users average 12 to 15 minutes to get through both the recommendation and enrollment process.Healthcare.gov drops you off at the doorstep of the carrier and thats it, says Noah Lang, founder of Stride.We stick around throughout the year  our team will sit on hold with the insurance company for two hours so you dont have to, he says.Stride has come a long way since launching in California in March of last year. The service isnow live in six additional states  New York, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania  spanning 44% of the population, and theyretappinginto growingnetworks of contract employeesthrough partnershipswith Uber, TaskRabbit, and Postmates.Initially a recommendation engine connecting workers to health plans, Stride is evolving intoa broadersupport structure forindependent workers.The key is to utilize the broker revenue streamin order to provide a bunch more services for workers who are not getting the set of services that have historically been provided by the employer, says Bryan Roberts of Venrock, who is joining Strides board.Then you can become the HR platform for people who dont have one, and help them with taxes, and expenses, and aggregation of income streams  and really empower this burgeoning portion of the U.S. workforce, he says.Thats exactly where Stride is headed. Theyve already partnered with 50,000 pharmacies in the U.S. to help usersfind the most affordable prescriptions in their area, whether theyre insured or not. And later this summer, Stride will be opening up its service to people who have already purchased health plans somewhere else.Youre going to see us releasing additional products that both customers and non-customers can use  were going to be touching their financial lives a little bit more than we were before, says Lang.This includesnotifying users to pay monthly premiums before they lose coverage, helping customers deduct health expensesfrom their taxes, or providing employers of freelance workers (like Uber or Postmates) the option to offer their employees healthcare stipends through the Stride platform.Theres a lack of trust in consumer brands in healthcare today, and one of the reasons were expanding quickly to 50 states is to own that space  were building a national brand for independent working Americans, Lang says.
