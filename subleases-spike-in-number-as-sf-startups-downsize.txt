In January, office rents in San Francisco eclipsed those of New York to become the most expensive in the country.Two months later, there are signs the San Francisco may not maintain its dubious position for long. The biggest indicator:Theres suddenly 1.7 million square feet of sublease space available in San Francisco, up more than 50percent from 1.1 million square feet in November, according to CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm.Thatkind ofjump infour months time suggests ripple effects from a funding slowdown that stretch beyond a small but growing number of layoffs.If the trend isnt giving local landlords flashbacks of the late 1990s, it may soon. The Bay Areas real estate market enjoyed a historically active 2015, with San Francisco accounting for the worlds highest rent growth at 14 percent, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. (Oakland saw the third biggest jump in rent nationally, said the brokerage.)Thelast time San Francisco surpassed New York in price per square footage, says CBRE,was 2000, the same yearthe tech market famously peaked, then abruptly imploded.Of course, todays volatility in the public tech sector pales in comparisonto the tech market nosedive that followed the dot-com boom of 16 years ago. The slowdown in venture investing isnt as sudden or severe, either, making it too early to tell if the economy has turned in a meaningful way, says Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE.Still, says Yasukochi, There are definitely signs of change.Its mostly a question of how severe they are, and how they evolve.Bay Area brokers, landlords and tenants appear to be in a kind of discovery stage at the moment.On the one hand, despitethedramatic increase insubleased space thats becomeavailable, new tenants arent seeing a huge discount, which is usually an indication of a weak market.Itdepends on how long the lease is one, two or five years or more in terms of cost, says Yasukochi. But if you compare a good quality sublease space to a good, quality space direct from its owner, youre seeing maybe a 10 percent markdown.Its when discounts rise to 30 and 40 percent that amarket is officially in trouble, saysYasukochi.Yasukochi says another clue that the market is holding its own centers on commercial real estate development, which has been booming in recent years and continues unabated for now.I havent seen developers stop their projects yet, says Yasukochi, who began tracking the real estate industry in 2000. Most of the buildings that are under construction right now are fairly well under way, and the one office building in downtown San Francisco thats just starting construction appears to be going ahead with its plans.According to Colliers International data, four commercial properties were completed in San Francisco in the fourth quarter alone, opening up 1.2 million square feet of new space to the market.Notably, all the newly completed construction was pre-leased, with tenants scheduled to takeoccupancy during the first half ofthis year. Yasukochi saysthat were also notreally seeing landlords trying to increase rents and otherwise tighten terms for tenants, which is a clear sign of nervousness.That may be starting to change.So suggestsEvan Combs, a San Francisco-based adviser at Cresa, a corporate real estate advisory firm that helpstech startups land the right space and which began to observe the increase in subleased property in the third quarter of last year.Combs says that while we havent seen landlords shifting their pricing plans yet, he and his colleagues have registeredmore landlords now trying to tie up their vacancies. Ifthey can lock someone in for fiveto seven years, theyre going to do it.CBREs Yasukochi also notes that the real estate market typically lags the broader investment market by half a year. That could mean that if the market is going to get squeezed, that shift is around thecorner.When the stock market peaked in April 2000, the real estate market reacted six months later, he says. The same thing happened [following the financial crisis of] 2008. Whether this market peaked lastJuly when the Nasdaq hit5200,or it effectively peaked in the fallor later  possibly when mutual fund investorsbegan publicly marking down their private company holdingsis an open question, Yasukochi notes.Either way, he says, Ive got to imagine that any new [building] starts this year will be scrutinized much more.Plainly, so will theamount ofspace that tech companies need to make it through this year,given amostly shut IPO market and investors who are thinking harder about each check they write.Suchreassessments arent so terrible, particularly given the runaway perks that startups had begun to offer their employees. Lets face it; theres less pressure to build an office slide when everyone else iscutting back on spending.The growing amount of subleased inventory is undoubtedly welcome news for nascent tech companies, too.While startups still request those personal touches they all want the communal kitchen and the game room, Combs says,startups have also grown more opportunistic.Thoughsubleases arentcoming at a hugediscount (yet), young companiesare stillbenefiting from entering into placesthat other tech companies previously occupied.The infrastructure is in place, says Combs. These officesrequire less build out.That [equates to] cash flow preservation, and at a time when startups appear to need it the most.
