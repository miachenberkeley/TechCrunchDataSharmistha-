We all saw it coming, but its still hard to swallow. Well-designed calendar app and service Sunrise will be removed from the stores in the next few days. The servers will be shutting down on August 31st.Todays news shouldnt come as a surprise as Microsoft acquired the New York-based startup in early 2015. The iOS app hasnt been updated since July. And Microsoft already announced that Sunrise would be shutting down. We just didnt know when.The plan is to put all of Sunrises great calendar features into Microsofts mobile email client, Outlook, which is what the Sunrise team has been working on.For now, the calendar part of Outlook is nowhere near as good as Sunrise. Thats why Ive been trying alternatives and writing poems about Sunrise.Sadly, I still miss Sunrise. Is it too late now to say Im sorry?Thanks for the heads up Microsoft. If youre still using Sunrise, its time to move on. As for me, Im going to pour myself a drink.
