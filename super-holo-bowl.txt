Watching sports could soon be a very different experience  at least if its up to Microsoft and the NFL. Before you know it, a holographic player could be charging through your walls and replays could play in 3D on your coffee table.Microsoft today released a new concept for its HoloLens augmented reality goggles that shows off its vision for what the combination of sports and HoloLenscould soon look like. Its worth watching, even if you dont like football.Not to rain on the parade, but as anybody who has tried the HoloLens prototype will tell you,this is still very much science fiction  not because HoloLens doesnt work (Ive tried it, and it sure does), but because the field of vision you get from the current version simply doesnt give you the kind of immersive experience Microsoft shows in its video.Microsoft is soliciting applications from developers right now and expects to ship its $3,000 HoloLens developer edition to a select group of them in the first quarter ofthis year (likely around the time of its Build developer conference, which conveniently starts on March 30).
