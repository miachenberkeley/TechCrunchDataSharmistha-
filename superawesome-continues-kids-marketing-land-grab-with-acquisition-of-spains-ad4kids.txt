SuperAwesome, the ad network and marketing platform for kids and teens, continues to be on a mini-shopping spree. The London-headquartered company is acquiring Spanish startup Ad4Kids, a platform for mobile app developers to cross-promote their kid-safe apps, in an all-cash, otherwise undisclosed, deal.It adds to a spew of recent acquisitions and acqui-hires by SuperAwesome that includes the purchase of U.S.-based MobiGirl Media, a mobile ad network for girls, and, more recently, the sales and ad teams of kids virtual world Bin Weevils.And lets not mention a failed attempt to take MyFamilyClub, the parenting finance community and Mumsnet competitor, off the hands of media giant DC Thomson. A deal I understand went right to the wire before ultimately being aborted.Its a massive validation for the entire kids market and sends a huge message to brands that they should follow suit, he says. Theres $11 billion-plus spent on TV advertising but just $700 million in digital advertising across the kids market. Clearly thats completely out of step with the reality of where kids are.And while Collins is clearly biased  SuperAwesome is starting to resemble a kids marketing land grab while no one is looking; its hard to argue with his assertion that Google has realised that theres a wall of money waiting in the sector so theyre going after it.The market is going to 3x or 4x in the next couple of years, he adds.Meanwhile, its my understanding that Seville-based Ad4kids had been looking for investors or an exit, and so SuperAwesome saw an opportunity by means of acquisition to expand its reach further across Europe.Weve been focusing heavily on the U.S. market (which is growing quickly) but the opportunity to strengthen our reach in the EU made a lot of sense, says Collins.
