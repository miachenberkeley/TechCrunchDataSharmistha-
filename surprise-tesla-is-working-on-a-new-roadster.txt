The first car Tesla ever built, the Roadster, hasnt gotten a whole lot of love lately. They stopped building them back in 2012, after all.It looks like the Roadster is set for a revival, though. Buried deep in todays other Tesla news was word of a brand new Roadster model.After announcing a holy-crap-thats-fast, 0-to-60-in-2.8-seconds mode for the Model S P85D that the company rightly calls Ludicrous mode, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dropped this little detail:There is of course one speed faster than ludicrous, but that is reserved for the next generation Roadster in 4 years: maximum plaid.(Both Ludicrous mode and maximum plaid, of course, being Spaceball references)So itll be a few years, but Tesla isnt done with the Roadster just yet. And thats good news  particularly for those who want the breakneck speeds of the Model S P85D in a body thats a bit more exciting.Musk confirmed on a press call that, Spaceball references aside, this would be a new model.
