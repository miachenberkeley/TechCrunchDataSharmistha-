Controlling large swarms of robots is hard, at least on a human scale. But what if you trained them to follow your finger  via a tablet  much like youd train a swarm of cats to follow a laser pointer. Now youre cooking with gas.Georgia Techs GRITS Lab has created a system for moving multiple independent robots around just by touching a screen. Wherever your finger lands thats where the robots go. Not unlike Lily, the selfie drone, these robots flock around a central point automatically, missing each other as they move around and ensuring their paths are unencumbered. Quoth the team:While these sorts of tricks dont seem important, imagine a group of little robots following instructions autonomously around a disaster area or inside a building. An operator could ask the robots to check out a general location  a far corner, for example  and the robots would wend their way there like merry little mice.Its not possible for a person to control a thousand or a million robots by individually programming each one where to go, said Magnus Egerstedt, Schlumberger Professor in Georgia Techs School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a release. Instead, the operator controls an area that needs to be explored. Then the robots work together to determine the best ways to accomplish the job.There isnt much in the way of commercialization of these robots right now but expect some sort of usable version of this flocking technique to appear down the line as we start using drones to carry packages and ground robots to scout inhospitable areas. I, for one, welcome our flocking robotic overlords.via Spectrum
