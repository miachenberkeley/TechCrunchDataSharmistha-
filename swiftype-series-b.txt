Y Combinator-incubated search startup Swiftype has raised $13 million in Series B funding.When I first covered the company back in 2012, the pitch was pretty straightforward  it provided customizable search tools that didnt suck to sites like TechCrunch.On the other hand, online publishers might not be the most lucrative customer base, so while co-founders Matt Riley and Quin Hoxie told me they still support publishers (and we still use Swiftype at TechCrunch), theyve also expanded into other areas, particularly knowledge bases (basically, FAQs and customer support sites) and e-commerce.As examples of how the companys technology can deliver a better experience in both areas, Riley pointed to Swiftypes semantic understanding of searches  in e-commerce, it can be important to understand the difference between a blue dress and dress shoes, and with a knowledge base, its important not to get confused when someone enters a long, complicated question as their query. (The companyalso added live analytics last year.)Swiftype says its now used by hundreds of thousands of websites and apps, with customers ranging from Qualcomm and Dr. Pepper to Twitch and CloudFlare.The Series B was led by New Enterprise Associates, which also led the Series A. NEAs Chetan Puttagunta, who was recently promoted to partner,will join the firms John Sakoda  as well as Hoxie and Riley  on the Swiftype board.Asked why they seem to be doubling down on their relationship with NEA rather than bringing on new investors, Riley said, We feel like theyre going to be long-term partners.  Chetan works really hard and hes been incredibly helpful to both Quin and me, helping to guide us through what were learning about running a business.Swiftype has now raised more than $20 million in funding. Its investors include CrunchFund (which is backed by TechCrunch-owner AOL and, like TechCrunch, was founded by Michael Arrington).You can read more in Swiftypes blog post about the funding.
