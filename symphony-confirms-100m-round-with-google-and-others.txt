Symphony, the secure cloud-based communications platform,announced today that ithas received a $100 million round from a list of investors that includes Google, Inc.Googles part in theinvestmentwasfirstreported last week bythe Wall Street Journal,but the search giant was also joined byLakestar, Natixis, Societe Generale, UBS andexisting investor Merus Capital.The company actually went looking for $50 million, but the demand was so great, it ended up doubling its original request,Symphony CEO David Gurle told TechCrunch.While the stock markethas been erratic recently, and hasntalways been kind to cloud services, investors apparently liked what they saw with Symphony. The market is volatile, and people are cautious right now, but in spite of those conditions, investors allowed us to get more money than we wanted, he said.Its atestament to what we are doing, he added.Gurle suggested that this could be the last time Symphony has to dip into the capital markets for investment, which is fairly unusual for a company just two rounds into its investment lifecycle and just over a year old. While he joked nothing is certain but death and paying taxes, he said thatis the plan right now.We are in a good position not to go back to capital markets. For the time being we are well-situated with cash and in a very privileged position, he said.Symphony scored $66 million in its original investment round in Fall, 2014 from a consortium of Wall Street investment banks. This round is about expanding beyond its financial services roots, Gurle said.Weve always wanted to be the communication platform of choice for [all] business users, Gurle said. By starting with financial services, it helped set a standard for compliance and security that should apply across all industries, he said.Certainly, this is an interesting investment for Google, that comes from Google, Inc, rather than Google Ventures. Its not exactly a secret that Google has had trouble with social and Google + seems to be the forgotten step child these days.Google could belooking outwardly, and Symphony not only offers a secure communications tool that could help compete withMicrosofts Skype/Lync, it also has some intriguing content tracking abilities, letting you follow hashtags and keywords both inside the system and in public social networks like Twitter that could be attractive to Google.The company plans to use the money toexpand its sales and marketing arm. Up to this point, its been heavily weighted toward engineering with 100 of its 130 employees in engineeringtoday. While the company will add to that, it plans to double the number of employees over the next 12-18 monthswith the vast majority in sales and marketing, Gurle said.That involves expanding its presence in Europe and opening new offices in Japan and Australia next year. The company could also look at an acquisition or two if that makes sense and it plans to leave a good chunk in the bank as a hedge against a possible market slow-down.The product is actually available for free for anyone to use, but to get the enterprise-level security capability, it requires buying the enterprise version tool.
