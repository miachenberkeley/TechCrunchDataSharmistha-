Watching Netflix on your phone is a great way to blast through some spare time  but its also a great way to blast through your monthly allotment of data in no time flat.T-Mobile is using this as a competitive advantage. From this Sunday on, T-Mobile will no longer count Netflix (and a few other video services) against your data plan.T-Mobile calls the new feature Binge On, playing on the fact that people often refer to blasting through a zillion episodes of something in one sitting as binge watching.One caveat: streams on binge on will drop down to non-HD res of 480p, a considerably lower quality than the crazy high-def streams that most people are accustomed to getting. That wont look too terrible on most palm-sized phone displays  but youll probably notice the difference.Heres the list of sites that no longer hit your data plan:Itll be curious to see how  or if  other carriers respond to this. T-Mobile made a similar move with music services like Spotify/Pandora/etc. back in June of last year, and no other carrier followed suit.Music services dont use that much data, though  but video streaming sites? Thats a whole different story. Id imagine this move will make a considerably bigger impact.But wait: what about YouTube? That seems like quite the omission.
