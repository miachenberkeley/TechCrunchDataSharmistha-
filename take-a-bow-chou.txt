 Beingthe plucky mobile underdog in the fiery caldera of the smartphone market means HTC absolutely has to do things differently to grab some attention.So that meansbringing the ruckus to its marketing messages, as it puts it.Whether thats, in recent years,Ironman spitting out ridiculous acronyms. Orthelatest video ad to bear its three-letter stamp (via theVerge): a rap tribute called Hold The Crown, apparently written by HTC superfan Doc G of hip-hop outfit P.M. Dawn  with lyrics like your smartphones scared; they dont want to clash with a titan we own the universe; your Galaxy is overrated and make like the nerdy bloggers; put it in your pocket now.And  yes theres more  especially awkward backing moves courtesy ofa skinny, whiteHTC Americamarketing guy, called David Bruce.LinkedIn lists Bruceas a regional account execfor HTC, but hes rebrandedas MC D-Bruce for the purposes of this video parody. We hope.I say parody, but the effect ismore intentional self-mockery. Subtext: the H in HTC stands forsense of Humor, yo After all, this is not the first time weve enjoyed the smartphone markets most maverick maker sending itself up to bag some eyeballs. Remember this?Call the rapcringeworthy if you like  well it is, and thats kindathe point  but I for one salute HTCs CEO Peter Chou for possessinga funny bone and for letting his marketing departmentrapall over it.There is of course nothing more tedious and less humanizing than gadgetry that takes itself tooseriously. Add to that, pulling off this level of awkward corporate cringe actually takes some creative sweating toil.And thevideo appears to have struck the right chordwith that most notoriously hard to impress demographic:YouTube commenters.So perhaps HTC is onto something with itsWTF marketing.Take a bow Chou /Turn it loose Bruce.One things for sure: HTC iscertainly besting Android upstart rival Xiaomi in the funny videostakes. Unless the subtle genius of frying pan-based slap-stickis lost in translation.Judge for yourself
