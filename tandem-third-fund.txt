Mobile startup accelerator Tandem is announcing that it has closed a third fund totaling $100 million  a big step up from its second, $33 million fund.Tandem has previously backed startups like Bash Gaming (acquired by GSN), lost-item tracker Tile, and PlayHaven (now known as Upsight). It invests $200,000 initially and also brings startups to its Burlingame, Calif. offices for a six-month mentoring program.Co-founder Doug Renert told me that the new, bigger fund will allow Tandem to invest in more startups, to find startups from around the world, and to invest more money after the initial funding. (Tandem says it can invest $10 million or more in a startup.)I actually wrote about the third fund way back in July 2013, but Renert said the fundraising process took about as long as hed anticipated, because didnt really start in earnest until last year  until then, Tandem was still was still using money from the previous fund.Renert added that Tandems focus has expanded to include the Internet of Things, i.e., Internet-connected hardware. In fact, the new office includes a hardware lab. (The photo at the top of this post shows Renert and his co-founder Sunil Bhargava in the lab.) He said hes particularly excited about startups that arent just selling a gadget but offer a service as well, and startupstargeting boring industries that people have actually forgotten about  he pointed to companiesin the current group that focuson swimming pools and home security.We actually like these businesses in staid industries that are ripe for disruption, Renert said.I mentioned the current batch of startups, and it is indeed a larger group  six startups total (the standard for Tandem was previously three startups, though it was already growing). Heres the full list, with descriptions provided by the accelerator:The deadline apply for Tandems next group of startups is January 19. Heres the application.
