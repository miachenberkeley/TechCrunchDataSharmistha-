(Sphero, a robotics startup in the Disney accelerator, was picked by CEO Bob Iger to build a BB-8 droidbased on Disneys upcoming Star Wars film.) However, Stringfellow said this is the first retail-focused accelerator that Techstars has created.Ten companies will be selected to work out of the Target offices for three months next summer, where theyll be mentored by Target executives, as well as other local entrepreneurs and business leaders.The focus is on retail, but Stringfellow said that especially inthis first class, Were going to be very broad in terms of the categories of companies were accepting. So hes encouraging anyone who sees where Target can add value to their company or they can add value to Target to apply.That doesnt mean the startups will limited to working with Target. Stringfellow and Daniel Feld (vice president of operations at Techstars) both emphasized that participantswill be free to work with other retailers.And while the accelerator includes a small equity stake, Feld said, Techstars is the investor.  Target is going to be investing time and energy and talent into the companies for the benefit of the companies.Interested entrepreneurs can apply for the Techstars Retail accelerator here.Update: Techstars has also announced the hiring of Ryan Broshar, founder of Matchstick Ventures and co-founder of Beta.MN, as its managing director.
