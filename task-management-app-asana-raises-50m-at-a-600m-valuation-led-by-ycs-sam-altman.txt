Asana, an enterprise app thatlets peopleset and track projects and other goals, has hit a goal of its own: today, the company is announcingthat it has raised $50 million. The Series C round  led by Y-Combinators Sam Altman  values the company at $600 million, the company tells me.As a bit of context, Asana last raised $28 million in 2012; thatSeries Bwas at a $280 million valuation, according to our sources.Co-founded in 2009 by Facebook co-founderDustin Moskovitzand early FB employeeJustin Rosensteinout of the belief, in their own words, that every team in the world is capable of accomplishing bigger goals, and that software could help empower them to drive work forward with more ease, clarity, and accountability, the company will be using the funds to continue building out Asanas functionality (more on that below) and also expand its customer base internationally (its largely a US-based list of clients today).Asana today has 13,000 paying businesses as customers, up from 10,000 in September, and over 140,000 businesses using the productoverall adding some 10,000 every month. The company has bothfree and premium tiers, with the latter charged at$8.33 per member per month for groups above 15, and for more features.Moskovitz and Rosenstein saythat for the past four years,annual recurring revenue has beenmorethan doubling, and that the company is on track to profitability in thenext few years. This fundraising is the fuel we need to get to the next stage, and to accelerate the fulfillment of our mission, the founders note.In addition to Altman (who saidhe has wanted to invest in the company for a long time) thisroundincludes a long list of other very high-profile backers  a testament both to the founders own pedigrees but also Asanas place as one of the more respected and used startups in the productivity/enterprise apps space.They include 8VC (Joe Lonsdales new VC firm post Formation 8); Peter Thiels Founders Fund (which led Asanas Series B);Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan (respectively CEOs of Facebook and The Primary School);Tony Hsieh (Zappos CEO and Vegas visionary); Andrew Mason (Detour CEO and Groupon co-founder); Adam DAngelo of Quora;Aditya Agarwal and Ruchi Sanghvi; Eric Ries (Lean Startup author); Roger McNamee (Elevation Partners founder); andMoskovitz and Rosenstein themselves.The twopoint out that these investors businesses are Asana users, and the individuals use it, too, with some funny side notes. Dropbox VP Aditya Agarwal and Dropbox alum Ruchi Sanghvi use Asana to manage their domesticity; and Masons fervour, meanwhile, is so strong that he makes us look lukewarn on this whole Asana thing.As more businesses move their work processes online  creating documents and other data in apps like Quip or Google Docs or Microsoftthrough; communicating with each other (think Slack or Yammer)  productivity apps are havinga moment right now. Just last week, BetterWorks  another platform that helps workers set and manage tasks and goals  announced a Series B of $20 million.Indeed, in addition toBetterWorks and Asana itself, there are others likeBasecamp, Wrike and Trello all offering ways to boost productivity and help organizeso-called knowledge workers (essentially, thosetied to keyboards or screens to get their jobs done). That makes for a competitive landscape but also a sign of how there is a ripe opportunity to do more.For its part, Asana has been testing a beta of a product called Track Anything, which sounds likea dashboard-style product thatwill let people automaticallysignal to colleagues jobs forcompleting tasks without them having to do the legwork. In a working world where we are forever multitasking and may be more intent on getting things done rather than ticking and updating progress reports to let people know that we have, adding in automationseems to be an essential development. This is a challenge that others are tackling, too. BetterWorks is building integrations with whateversoftware use most, which in turn communicates our progress on a task in the background.
