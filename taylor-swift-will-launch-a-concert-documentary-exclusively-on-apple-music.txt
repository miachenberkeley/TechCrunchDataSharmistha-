After a series of back-and-forths between Apple and Taylor Swift over royalties, a near-break up between the superstar and Apple Music and a final mea culpa between the two, Swift is now planning on releasinga documentary for her 1989 concert tour exclusively on AppleMusic.Thank you so much for all the birthday wishes. I have a little surprise for you.

It could help attract more potential subscribers to Apple Music.While it represents a small sliver of potential revenue for the company, Apple Music can potentially makeApples platforms all that much more sticky  and keep people locked in Apples ecosystem. With Swift releasing her documentary exclusively on Apple Music, its likely others will follow  and give Apple an increasing library of content exclusive to its own services.Thisalso helps Apple Music offer something unique and unavailable onother music streaming services. Its an area where activity has started to quickly ramp up with the launchof YouTube Musicand the continuing presence of Spotify. Apple Music is also now on Android devices, helping Apple expand its brand even beyond its own devices  and potentially lure those users over to an iPhone or iPad.All this, taken together with Swifts new exclusive documentary, gives Apple a better method of drawing people into buying Apple devices.The crux of the issue was that while the unpaid trial period was not necessarily a problem for Swift,it couldbe a problem for independent musicians trying to make a living. Swift has garnered such a following that she was able to force Apples hand and change its policy, returning to paying royalties during the free trial period.This is simply the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album. Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart. Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015
