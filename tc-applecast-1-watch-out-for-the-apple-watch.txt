Its our first ever TechCrunch AppleCast, and were starting things off with a long look at the Apple Watch and its companion app, as well as a discussion on the (still theoretical) 12-inch MacBook Air. We also dive into Swift, Apples new programming language, which is really heating up in terms of developer interest, and touch on App Store discovery and what could still be done to help improve that situation.Our inaugural foray into Apple territory is just the beginning  well be aiming to bring you a new episode every week, covering the news of the day, as well as more general topics.
