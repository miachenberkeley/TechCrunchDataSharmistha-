This week, we reviewed the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, and we liked it. A lot. Apples MBP line is now the best value for money for anyone who wants to really be able to do work on the road, bar none, and the 13-inch size has great portability. But we cant help but wonder whats next for the MacBook Pro lineup, in light of the big changes signalled by the new MacBook.We also cover the latest Apple TV rumors in this weeks episode, based on the brand new report from Buzzfeed and John Paczkowski that claims a new piece of hardware, with a full App Store and Siri voice control is imminent. With apps and live TV streaming services, Apples set-top box could explode in the late half of 2015.June should be big for Apple, with this launch and a streaming music service debut, but remember we still have the Apple Watch and new MacBook launches between now and then.
