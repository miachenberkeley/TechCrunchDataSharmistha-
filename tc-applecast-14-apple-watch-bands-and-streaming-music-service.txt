This week were happy to have survived TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015 intact, so we talked a bit about how the Apple Watch seemed to make that process a lot easier to handle. The device lets you focus on whats happening around you, without missing things that arent, which is pretty much ideal for conference-going.We also discuss the Made for Apple Watch program, wherein Apple is providing detailed specifications and components to help create authorized third-party Apple Watch bands. Finally, we delve into the most recent news around Apples rumored coming streaming music service  a brand new report from Re/code today offers some specifics about what will be on offer besides what Beats already provides.This years Worldwide Developers Conference should shed some light on a bunch of the stuff we discuss, and it doesnt look like well be through talking about the Apple Watch anytime soon (weve got Apple Watch charging stands on the way). But if youve got anything specific you want to hear about on the show, be sure to send us a note.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
