On this weeks AppleCast, we discuss the overblown reaction to the news (gasp!) that people might steal your Apple Watch. Theres also more news coming in about potential Apple TV features, and the rumor mill in general is heating up ahead of WWDC, so we make some predictions about what well see there, in terms of Apple TV, WatchKit and other potential developments.Were actually kind of split on how big of a deal Apple Watch lacking an Activation Lock really is, but the consensus is that it probably isnt an omission that will remain long. Apple knows that adding that kind of feature can significantly affect theft rates, and is probably already at work on something or Watch OS 2.0.As for WWDC, its looking more and more likely like well see it act as a launchpad for whatever Apples streaming music offering turns out to be. We also all agree that new Apple TV hardware should break cover there, and that well hear a lot more about Watch software development. Specifically, it seems likely the native development framework will be introduced at this heavily developer-focused event.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
