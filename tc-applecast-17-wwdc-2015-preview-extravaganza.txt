The Apple WWDC 2015 keynote is just days away, so we discuss what you can expect to see at that special presentation. Basically its going to be a whole lotto iOS 9 and OS X 10.11, with a healthy heaping of Apple Watch and Watch OS thrown in. Beyond that, there are probably a few surprises in store.We go into detail about what we expect to see regarding Proactive, Home and HomeKit, Apple Maps Transit directions, and the rumored iTunes streaming music service. Weve also got some outlier predictions about Watch OS version 1.1 (or 2.0, whatever the next major revision is) and how Apple will go about testing native apps on the wearable.Besides WWDC, we also talk a bit about Thunderbolt 3, the newly-announced update for Intels high-bandwidth input/output standard. The next version sounds like it could be the only port Apple needs for a new generation of fast and light notebook Macs, and that presents a very interesting possibility for this coming holiday season.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
