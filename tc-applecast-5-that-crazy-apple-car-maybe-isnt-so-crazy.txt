Apple has spent the whole week in the news because of a car it might be making, so thats a real thing that happened. We discuss how the rumor went from airy tales to something quite solid, including a possible timeline for launch in 2020. Just what might an Apple Car actually look like, and why would the company even bother to make one? We dont know for certain, but we definitely have some ideas, and so does our friend MG Siegler.Other topics include the possibility that Apple will launch a public beta program for iOS, similar to the one it has for Mac OS X, in order to beta test new features and OS updates with a larger, more diverse cross-section of the general user population. This would be very good, and Apple can definitely afford to loosen up again when it comes to who gets a peek at new software early on.Finally, we turn our attention to Altos Adventure, a new iOS game from Toronto developer Snowman, which is a fantastic endless runner that harkens back to the glory days of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but with a simple, modern, beautiful aesthetic and gameplay geared for mobile. If youre looking for something to occupy your entire weekend, youve come to the right place.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
