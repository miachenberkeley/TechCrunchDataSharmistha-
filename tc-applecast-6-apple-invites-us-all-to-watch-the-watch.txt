This week Apple dropped an invite to a special event on March 9, and everyone forgot Mobile World Congress was even happening. The event will likely focus on the Apple Watch, which is set for an April retail debut, and which Apple has been talking about since it unveiled the wearable wrist computer back at its iPhone event last September.Were expecting to get firm details on store dates for the Apple Watch on the 9th, as well as pricing for the various models, and specific information about accessories and third-party apps. But we also could be in for some additional announcements regarding long-rumored products, like the supposed 12-inch MacBook Air, and the larger iPad Pro with similar display dimensions. The timing might be right for a shared announcement of a host of new products.Next week will probably bring more info regarding the upcoming event, so maybe well have additional answers in time for the next AppleCast. In the meantime, send us any questions you might have about the event or the announcements thatll be made there, and well do our best to answer either next time, or on the episode following the actual announcement.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
