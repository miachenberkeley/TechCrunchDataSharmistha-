Its that time: The Apple Watch event happens Monday, and well get answers to all our remaining burning questions about the wearable coming out of Cupertino. Based on our discussion, were very much still in the dark about how much these will cost, and just how much third-party software will be able to offer. Also, we discuss what else Apple might show off on stage, including a refreshed Apple TV or Thunderbolt display.Price remains the big blank space in terms of our current knowledge about the Apple Watch, given how many details have been filled in by last-minute leaks and reports. Were also eager to see who Apple chooses to help show off whats possible with third-party apps on the Apple Watch, especially given the apparent limitations of the developer tools available currently.Apple will probably also have some surprises in store  its a very rare special event hosted by the company where nothing unexpected comes out. Well be there to cover it live, of course, and will also have lots of follow-up and features around the new announcements in the days to follow, so stay tuned.Direct download available here, or find us on iTunes and SoundCloud.
