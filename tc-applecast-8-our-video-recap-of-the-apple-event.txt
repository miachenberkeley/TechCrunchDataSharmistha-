On Monday, Apple held a special event focused on the all-new 12-inch MacBook with a Retina display, and the Apple Watch, providing us a deeper look at the smartwatchs software. The special event merits a special podcast, so we got Matthew Panzarino, Darrell Etherington and Kyle Russell together to capture the magic on video. And theres an audio version, too, so pick your poison.The Apple Watch was indeed a star of the show, but the event also highlighted Apples new MacBook, which has a case thats 13.1mm thin at its thickest point, with a taper that accommodates a custom-created, terraced battery arrangement for all-day use (10 hours give or take). That notebook also has a 12-inch Retina display, and a single USB-C type input/output port for power and data connectivity.Apples notebook is clearly its vision for the future, and one of the more interesting links between the Apple Watch and the computer is the use of two of its newest technological achievements: force touch and taptic feedback. These account for a lot of the wow factor associated with both products, and we discuss them at length.The video is above, and the audio stream is below, as usual.
