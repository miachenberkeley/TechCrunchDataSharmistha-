This weeks Cribs episode takes us to Minted, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers. Minted hangs its headquarters shingle in San Franciscos historic Jackson Square neighborhood.Stunning is the word for Minteds interior. The two-story, 32,000-square-foot office space was originally built in 1909 and boasts large windows with lots of natural light,high concrete ceilings and walls covered with art, and turned over books, complimenting a mix of hard and soft textiles. Minted also imported the large slabs of greyed wood flooring and gave it a braided chevron (or herringbone) design.Studio O+A, a Bay Area architecture and design firm that also shaped the look for other well-known tech companies such as Yelp and Uber, produced Minteds office flow. CEO Mariam pulled inKE Designfounder and interior designer Kendall Ermshar to work on Minteds look. Ermshar has designed a few tech founders residential areas around Silicon Valley. He wouldnt name names, but has worked onNaficys home.Naficywanted Minted to have a comfortable, homey feel. She and Ermshar worked together on creating a space that truly feltthat way for employees. Youll see pillows, faux fur and soft rugs mixed in with dark leather couches and gorgeous lighting to create the look. Also, note the sheen of the copper wall greeting visitorsat Minteds front desk.Workers gather in an old library or a repurposed bank vault filled with dozens of big, fluffy pillows to meet and work. There are flower arranging classes, art sessions and easels ready for a painting break near the gorgeous views from the buildings large paned windows.Other social perks include a full-time barista serving Blue Bottle coffee and access to yoga classes, healthy snacks and a game room. I met up with Naficy to take a look.
