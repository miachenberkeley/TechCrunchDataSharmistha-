This week, we talk a lot about watches since the first salvo of Apple Watch reviews are out, and we can finally compare it in practical terms to Android Wear. We also discuss the Galaxy S6, which has every sign of being the best Android smartphone available.Our discussion of Android Wear jumps off from Googles official blog post about the platform today, which seems like a meek response to the press the early reviews of Apples wearable has been garnering. Google points out that its curating Android Wear watch faces differently, and also offers a smattering of links for third-party watch bands, but we believe it needs to do more with its own storefront to play up the personalization options for wearables built on its own software.We also talk about the Galaxy S6 Edge, which is a very impressive smartphone at first glance. The camera is especially powerful, which is a big advantage when it comes to comparing Samsungs device to the rest of the Android flagship crowd.Subscribe on iTunes and check out past episodes right here on TechCrunch.Download it directly here: http://traffic.libsyn.com/droidcast/droidcast-44.mp3
