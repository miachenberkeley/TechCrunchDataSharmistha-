Our first Droidcast back in 2015 includes ample CES discussion, as well as first-hand accounts of Googles Project Ara news from Kyle Russell. Darrell Etherington talks about the YotaPhone 2 dual-screen smartphone with e-ink tech, and Greg Kumparak spurs us all on to greater heights. The holiday cobwebs and CES hangovers are gone, and were eager to see what comes in 2015 for Googles mobile OS.Upcoming stuff were tracking include the LG G Flex 2, one of the few smartphones launched at CES this year, as well as MWC, which is possibly the biggest mobile-focused event of the year and which happens the first week of March. If you have any questions or comments on the show, please send them along and well try to answer them next week.Subscribe on iTunes and check out past episodes right here on TechCrunch.Download it directly here: http://traffic.libsyn.com/droidcast/droidcast-33.mp3
