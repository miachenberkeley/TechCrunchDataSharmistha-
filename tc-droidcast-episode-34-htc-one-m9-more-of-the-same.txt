This week we look at the rumoured new HTC One M9 (or whatever itll be called, HTCs newest flagship) which well get our first look at on March 1. These first spy shots seem to indicate itll be similar to last years M8, but is that good enough to make it one of the best Android phones of 2015? In other news, we take another look at the Amazon Fire Phone, six months after its launch, and end up wishing we hadnt.The Droidcast team of Darrell Etherington, Kyle Russell, and Greg Kumparak also wonder about the secret sauce that leads to wearable success, and whether HTC can muster some of that for its own rumored device. HTC is a little like that kidfrom grade school you always thought was going to be like a celebrity or software mogul when you grew up  but who ended up just gettinga pretty good job at the top local employer instead.As usually, if you have something youd like us to discuss on the Droidcast, please email and let us know.Subscribe on iTunes and check out past episodes right here on TechCrunch.Download it directly here: http://traffic.libsyn.com/droidcast/droidcast-34.mp3
