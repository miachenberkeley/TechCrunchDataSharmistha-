This week, we have a rare opportunity to just plain unleash on a device: The Neptune Duo, which puts all the smartphone smarts inside an Android-powered smartwatch, then makes the screen in your pocket essentially a dumb receiver. Its backwards and bad, and we find were mostly in agreement on that point.In other news, LG has another Android Wear device coming to market, making three for the Korean OEM. This one is called the Watch Urbane, and it attempts a high-fashion approach thanks to fancy metal finishes, with a round face taken pretty much directly from the G Watch R. But is a fancy take on hardware enough to chase the premium customers who will be seeking out the Apple Watch?We also address Sonys SmartEyeglass, and whether it can meet a better end than Google Glass. And finally, we imagine what Samsung might be up to with wireless charging in the Galaxy S6, and whether anything it can do in that regard would be enough to seriously influence sales and bring in new customers, given the limits of wireless charging in general.Subscribe on iTunes and check out past episodes right here on TechCrunch.Download it directly here: http://traffic.libsyn.com/droidcast/droidcast-38.mp3
