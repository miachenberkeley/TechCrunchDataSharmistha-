As weverecently pointed out, here on TC, T&Cs suck. Butwhat sucks even more than impenetrable, multi-clause legalese thatno-one reads is the fact these unlovely documents can change without warning  effectively requiring users of the services they govern to engage in a perpetual reading to ensure they are abreast of changes.Aka:These conditions may change without prior notice, so we recommend you to consult them regularly.In an attempt to circumventthis slippery,Catch-22 behavior,a team oflaw specialists and engineersbased in Spain has put together an online tracker for T&Cs changesto help flag up when small print shifts, and help users figure out when to takenotice of a particular update (and maybe even read the relevant chunks of text).The free trackerdoes this by comparing the most recent version of legal texts with the prior version, running a comparison every 12 hours to pick up changes regularly. It then lists (and dates) these changes, as well as color-coding their significance (including flagging up whether they have been communicated to users). It also displays the percentage of text that has changed since the last update.Documentchanges are reviewed by someone with legal knowledge prior to publishing on the site  so its not just a tech-powered text comparison service, according to the team, but rather involves a layer ofhuman expertiseto determine how significant a T&Cs update is.The tracker monitors changes in Terms of Use, Privacy Policies, Cookie Notices and multipleother legal texts that are generally badged as terms and conditions. Old and new T&Cs are presented side by side for comparison. Text that has been added to the new T&Cs is highlighted ingreen. Text thats been deleted is highlighted in red (on the old T&Cs).Itscurrently keeping tabs on some 5,600+ services and 6,700+ legal documents (not all of these are available in English, with Spanish the secondary default if theres no English version)  and saysthere have been just under 130 changes to T&Cs of the businesses its been monitoring in the past week.As well as browsing recent changes, users can search for  and subscribe to  specific companies to keep track ofhow their T&Cs evolve.Recent changes flagged up by the tracker include genetic testing service 23andMe adding a suggestion for usersto consult a genetic counselor prior to testing toits T&Cs; specifyingpercentages for when its labs arent able to process a sample (up to 3% of the time) or a second sample (up to 0.35% of the time); and noting thatits research arm may be sponsored by, conducted on behalf of, or in collaboration with third parties, such as non-profit foundations, academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies.While a recent erasure from TC parent AOLs Terms of Service document removesexplicit detailsnotice that users signing up to its service and providing a mobile or landline telephone number are consenting to giving AOL the ability to use autodialed and prerecorded messages to contact them.A further deleted clause specifies that users are consenting to receiving SMS/text messages to their number, and provided information on how to opt out.Extensive changes to Apples Commitment to Customer Privacy documentare also recordedbythe tracker  including significant wording shifts (in line with Apple recently overhauling how it presents privacy info to users), and shifting details such as the proportion of Apple users wheredata has been disclosed due to a government request: less than 0.00571%has beenupdated to less than 0.00673% in the most recent update.Jorge Morell Ramos, one of the Mallorca-based team behind the tracker, notes that many companies are making (even more) regular changes to privacy policies in light of the European Court of Justice invalidating the U.S.-Europe data-sharing Safe Harbor agreement earlier this month.Hesays the tracker is one of multiple tech-law based projects the team is working oninits legal lab. They also want to developan API for the trackerto get the information circulating more widely. The wider idea behind the labisto develop legal tools and productstotry to shake upa sector thats pretty set in its ways, he adds.
