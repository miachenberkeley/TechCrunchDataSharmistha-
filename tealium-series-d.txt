Tag management is not, perhaps, the sexiest problem for a startup to tackle, but Tealium seems to have turned it into a successful business, as indicated by the ever-growing funding rounds that it raises every yearlike clockwork. And yes, its announcing the latest of those rounds today  a $30.7 million Series D led by Georgian Partners.For those of you who dont know, tag management means helping websites implement the tags that they use to gather data  for example placing cookies for ad targeting. Thats pretty important on its own, but CEO Jeff Lunsford told me that the broader vision is to build a real-time data platform on top.After all, Lunsford told me that the average Tealium customer is trying to integrate its data with more than 20 different systems, ranging from email marketing to banner ad networks to content management systems. Bringing data into those systems leads to more personalized messaging, but often requiresa lag of 24 hours or more.In contrast, Lunsford said that with Tealiums AudienceStream product, marketers can get that data in real time.I have a 21-year-old daughter, and if you try to target her what she was interested in 24 hours ago, forget about it, he said. You need to target her based on what shes interested in [while shes still in the same session]. Were trying to streamline this data supply chain to help our customers go from batch file transfers to real time.About 50 of Tealiums 500+ customers are currently using AudienceStream, Lunsford said. Looking ahead, hes planning to expand internationally and to move beyond marketing, because he said theres a lot of apps besides marketing apps that could use this data.He also emphasized that as Tealium expands, its also trying to keep a neutral approach: Were not trying to be a personalization vendor. Were trying to be that standard neutral data layer that everyone feeds off of.The company says its organic sales grew 138 percent last year.The new funding included a major investment from Bain Capital, with participation from previous investors Battery Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Presidio Ventures.
