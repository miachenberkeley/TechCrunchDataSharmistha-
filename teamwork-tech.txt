Last quarters$333 millionis by far the highest amount of capital committed in a single quarter to date.VCs closedsome huge dealslast year, includinga $120 million mega-roundfor enterprise messaging startupSlack, butthe recent influx ofearly-stage capitalprovestheresstill a needfor bettertools.Last quarter, the average seed deal weighed in at just over$1 million more than two times 2013saverage of $430k.Most founders behind thenew waveof collaboration tech are well-acquaintedwith the flaws in the current system. Eric Yuan, founder and CEO of video collaboration startup Zoom, has more first-hand knowledgethan most.As the ex-Corporate VP of Engineering at Cisco, Yuanspent years building and iterating on enterprise videoconferencing appWebEx before founding Zoom. Zooms latest $30 million, from a list of investors including Jerry Yang, Qualcomm Ventures and Emergence Capital Partners, represents the largest round in the space this year.While working on WebEx, Yuan identifieda huge market opportunity for mobile device-enabledvideo conferencing. Its a mobile era, [yet]no other conference room solution can support that, says Yuan.Zoomunifies video conferencing and group messaging in a single tool so that companies can deploya full capacityconference room with a single iPad.The adoption of mobile devices is creating a huge opportunity, says Santi Subotovsky, partner atEmergence Capital. Eighty percent of the worlds workforce is not sitting in front of a computer, but now they have mobile devices,Subotovsky says.Zoom is among a growing bunch of venture-backed startups aiming to bridgethe dividebetween mobile and desktop collaboration functionality. Quip, a mobile productivity startup, has accumulated$15 million in venture fundingto improvethe document sharing and editing process across all devices.In some ways, the way people work with each other hasnt really changed in 30 years, says Kevin Gibbs, co-founder and Head of Engineering at Quip.We have these amazing smartphones that are so powerful, but mostly what you can do with them is send an email  opening and editing documents on a phone is generally not a good experience, says Gibbs.Gibbs says that companies running on Quip range fromsmall startup teamsto giants like Facebook and Instacart.But the tech world isnt the only place where collaboration tech is simplifying teamwork. Yuan says that 30% of Zooms customers are in the education sector, and another 10% inhealth care.Were seeing a new wave of vertically focused collaboration applications in industries where you need a specific technology in order to communicate, says Subotovsky.Subotovsky, who led the Emergence Capitalsrecent deal for Zoom, says it was the largest check the firmhas ever written. When you look at these verticals, they cant use off the shelf apps because theyre notmeeting regulations, they need to use proprietary tools. If someone builds an application that meets those standards, they can build a huge collaboration suite, says Subotovsky.Remind, a communication servicefor teachers, students and parents, has raised $60 million in venture funding to build outa mobile-focused collaboration toolfor the education market. Launched in 2012, Remind is currently used by 35% of U.S. teachers to send text reminders or administer real time quizzes to their students.We spend a ton of time listening to small nuances from teachers that make a big difference, says Brett Kopf, founder of Remind. For example, were very focused on safety  we track message history, you cant ever delete a message, a teacher never sees a students number and a student never sees a teachers number. And if a teacher tries to send a message after 9pm, we send a message like might 9:30pm be a little late?Whether in a middle school, a hospital, or a startup office space, the next wave ofcollaboration startupswill succeedby solvingindustry-specific problems.If youre looking for something in a marketplace, like education or health care, you need something that works  a product thats enterprise grade, but not necessarily at enterprise grade prices, says Subotovsky.In the next 5 to 10 years, were going tosee the collaboration space blow up significantly.
