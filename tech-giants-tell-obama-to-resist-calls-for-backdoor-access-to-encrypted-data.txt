Apple, Google, Yahoo and more than 140 other tech industry companies have written toPresident Obama urging him to shoot down demands for backdoor access to user data on smartphones and other communication devices and platforms, the Washington Post reports.Update: You can now see the letter here.The tech industry hasincreasingly pushed the issue of user privacy since Edward Snowden first leaked the details of NSA spying initiatives back in 2013. However, some agenciesof the state are uneasy about the rise of encryption.U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson recently commented that the inability to access encrypted information poses public safety challenges. In other words, the inabilityto access data could preventdefense agencies from actually defending the nation  or so the argument goes.This letter, which is due to be sent to Obama on Tuesday, counters the claim that encrypting user data is dangerous for the nation.Strong encryption is the cornerstone of the modern information economys security, the companies wrote in the letter, which wasalso signed by technology consultants and rights groups.It is not just endorsed by tech firms, however.The Post reported that three of the five members of Obamas committee into technology practices, which was established following the Snowdenleaks,signed the letter  which was organized byNew America Foundations Open Technology Institute.Since last fall, the president has been letting his top law enforcement officials criticize companies for making their devices more secure and letting them suggest that Congress should pass pro-backdoor legislation, Kevin Bankston,policy director of the institute, told the Post.Its time for Obama to put an end to these dangerous suggestions that we should deliberately weaken the cybersecurity of Americans products and services. Its time for America to lead the world toward a more secure future rather than a digital ecosystem riddled with vulnerabilities of our own making, Bankston added.Obama previouslytoldRe/codes Kara Swisherthat he is a bigger advocateofencryption than U.S.law enforcement officials, but he also conceded that it poses issuesfor defense agencies. That said, the Snowden leaks have made it clear that allowing near-blanket access to user data is a hugely inefficient and seemingly easily abused way of managing the situation. The debate willrage on, but  from a users point of view  it is important to see that tech companies are standing up for privacy.
