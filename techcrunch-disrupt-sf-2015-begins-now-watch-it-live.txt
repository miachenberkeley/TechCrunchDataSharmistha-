Two days down, one to go.Weve seen the likes of Ron Conway, Yuri Milner, Aileen Lee, and John Doerr cross our stage. Snoop Dogg and Andre Iguodala also sat down for a chat. And then, of course, major entrepreneurs like Drew Houston, Nick Woodman, Tim Westergren, and Andrew Boz Bosworth taught us a little something about building products that not only delight but make money.And if that werent enough, we saw 25 companies launch on the Disrupt Battlefield stage.Today, well hear from Sam Altman, Ron Johnson, Vinod Khosla and Eric Migicovsky, and then well head into the Disrupt Battlefield Finals, featuring Agrilyst, Green Bits, Leap Financial, Preemadonna, Scrumpt, and Stitch.Enjoy!
