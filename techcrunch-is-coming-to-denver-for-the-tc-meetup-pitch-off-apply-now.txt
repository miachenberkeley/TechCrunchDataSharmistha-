Autumn is here, my friends, and with the falling leaves I bring you good tidings of great joy that shall be heard among the greater Denver area:In exactly one month, TechCrunch is hitting the Rocky Mountain State for the TC Meetup + Pitch-Off in Denver in conjunction with Denver Startup Week. The event will be held at 1644 Platte Street on October 1 at 6pm.This will be our first Meetup event in Denver, so its fair to hit you with a bit of an explanation: The TC Meetup + Pitch-off is a one-night-only event that invites folks from the tech scene (or anyone really) to come together and get to know each other.But thats not all.We also hold a pitch-off, wherein ten pre-selected companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of expert VC judges.First place receives a table in Startup Alley at TC Disrupt. Second place gets two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner takes home one ticket to the big show.All in all, its bound to be a night to remember.Also, there will be booze (so 21+ only, please).If youre interested in participating in the Pitch-Off, apply right here.Tickets to the event can be found here.Sponsors make TechCrunch Events possible.
