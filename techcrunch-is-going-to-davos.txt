The World Economic Forum  held in the mountain village of Davos, Switzerland every year  has increasingly become a place where its usual attendees (the captains of the worlds biggest industries) have been joined by the biggest and hottest technology firms. As software famously eats the world so too do the most influential people in tech now eat the canaps served at the meetings of heads of states.The reasons are very simple: Technology is having an enormous effect on the policies of governments and the biggest global industries. And technology leaders like Eric Schmidt, Marissa Mayer and Bill Gates are attending Davos alongside some of the biggest startups, as they too affect the world. Furthermore, technology solutions for the problems of the developing world  an ongoing concern at Davos  are mushrooming.Its for these reasons that TechCrunch has decided to go in force to Davos, and bring our tech mojo to the so-called Magic Mountain.
