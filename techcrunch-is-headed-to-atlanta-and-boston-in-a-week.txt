Each year, we visit the beautiful city of Atlanta, and each year, we walk away more impressed than the year before. The same is true of Boston  we visit in the depths of winter, and still Boston startups trek out to show their stuff.Next week, well visit these amazing cities once again with hopes to discover the best new technology out there. The goal is to bring the community together, get to know the fine entrepreneurs of Atlanta, and get the word out about cool local startups.In order to do this, we hold a Pitch-Off, where pre-selected companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product on stage to a panel of judges, including TechCrunch editors and local venture capitalists. In the end, well crown a winner and carry on talking about tech and throwing back a few cold ones.First place will receive a table at the Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt NY in May. Second place will receive two general admission tickets to Disrupt, and third place will receive one.But this isnt just about the entrepreneurs on stage. This is about the college kid who has a bright idea and wants to see what its like to build a startup. This is for the designer, the engineer, the journalist. Everyone is invited, as long as theyre 21 or older.Sound like something you might be into?You can buy tickets for the Atlanta Meetup (Tuesday, February 24 at 6pm at Prive, 960 Spring St. NW) right here.You can buy tickets for the Boston Meetup (Thursday, February 26 at 6pm at The Estate) right here.And without any further ado, Id like to announce the startups selected to participate in the TC Pitch-Offs in Atlanta and Boston:
