Its that time of year again. TechCrunch has survived Holiday Gift Guides and CES adventures in Vegas and is ready once again to hit the road. Boston and Atlanta, youre up to bat first. Get your game face on. Were bringing our world famous TechCrunch Pitch-Off all over the country over the next few months, and we cant wait to get started in two of our all-time favorite cities. The Pitch-Off is a two-piece event. We invite a panel of investor judges to check out the very best startups in each city we visit. Each company has exactly 60 seconds to pitch their startup with no demoes allowed. (If you want to participate, make sure to apply here.) Afterward, the startups, the investors, the TechCrunch writers, and the wonderful audience get to hang out, throw back a couple beers (these are 21+ events), and get to know each other. Were starting down south where weve had some of our most memorable meetups ever, visiting Atlantas Prive at 960 Spring St. NW on February 24, from 6pm to 10pm. Then, well head right back up to the North East to check out the latest and greatest startups out of Boston. That meetup will be held on February 26 at The Estate from 6pm to 10pm. Tickets cost $10 and can be found here for Atlanta and here for Boston.For more information on sponsorship packages and to discuss becoming a sponsor, please contact sponsors@techcrunch.com.
