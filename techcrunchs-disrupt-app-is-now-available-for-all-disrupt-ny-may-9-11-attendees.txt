We promised to make networking at Disrupt a lot better, and today were making a big part of that promise a reality with the launch of the Disrupt app inApples App Store and Google Play.The app is custom-designed for attendees at TechCrunchs Disrupt NY (May 9-11). Point of pride: We built the app in-house with help from our friends at Layer, the winner of TechCrunchs Battlefield SF in 2013. Every feature is about finding people, communicating with them and getting the most out of Disrupt.Once you have a ticket to Disrupt NY, you can download the app and register.See you at Disrupt NY!
