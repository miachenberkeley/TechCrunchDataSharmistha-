Reliable startup data is tough to find and track in Asia  let alone in the U.S. or other parts of the world  and, with the region an increasingly important one, this isaproblem thatTechlist, a service from fellow blog Tech In Asia (hi guys),aims to solve. Today, Tech In Asia announcedthe service has pivoted to a new model andthat it is part ofthe Y Combinator Winter 2015 program.Entry to YC is amajorendorsement for Techlist, whichis the only participantfrom Southeast Asia inthe latest batch atthe highly respected U.S. accelerator.Techlist is not a startup itself, instead theservice is part of Tech In Asia, a media companywith offices in Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and Japan, and$2.89 million in funding from investors to date. Tech In Asia counts75 employees across its three businesses: media Tech In Asia,itsAsia-focused tech and startup news site, andGames In Asia its Startup Asia events program, and Techlist.Our mission is to help build the startup ecosystem in Asia, Willis Wee, who founded TechIn Asia after graduating fromSingapore Management University in 2010, told TechCrunch in an interview. Last year, we realized thathaving a database would help accelerate things.Techlist was initiallya platform to connect investors and startups in Asia, much like Angel List, but Wee said he quickly realized that it wasnt being used that way and the model was changed accordingly.Foundersdidnt want to share their data that openly. But whenwe talked to them,theytold us thatthey would share informationif we locked it up  in other words, if it was only seen byinvestors and selected others, then they would be more willing to give, he explained.Thus, while there are surface level comparisons between Techlist and TechCrunchs own Crunchbase,the full spectrumofTechlist data  which includes more than 1,000 Asian companies, and 100-plus new entries a week  is only forpaying customers. There is a free option, but availableinformationis limited.Access to the Pro version of Techlist is priced at$399 per seat per month, a sufficient hurdle to attract the right audience.That package providesaccess to a treasure trove of data about Asian startups  including funding/employee/web traffic history  as well as vertical, industry-wide data for trends, such as funding.Tech In Asia also offers an enterprise package for more advanced requirements. Thats priced according to the needs of each client and operates much like a consulting partnership, with Techlist workingto provide requests using itsdatabase and in-house analysis.What sets Techlist aside from other data services is not only its focus on Asia but itspartner-led approach tocollecting data.Wee said that around half of the sites informationis pulled inusing technology, while a further 40 percent comesfrom Techlists own staff  the remaining 10 percent is via startups themselves. One-tenthmight not sound like a lot, but, beyond the numbers, the most valuable data about a company is typically for the eyes of founders only, so securing some of that harder-to-find information is what Weebelieves makes Techlist unique.Databases are often focused on serving investors, but Techlist isbuilt more like a marketplace and less like a one-sided business, hesaid.Aside from the pricing barrier, all Techlist users must agree to an NDA on sign-up which forbids them from using data beyond due diligence purposes. (That chart above is one graphic that Techlist deemed suitable for public consumption, in case you wondered.)Furtherdown the line, we are considering how we can help startups raise money, Wee said of Techlists future plans. With our data, and the demand and supply, we are definitely working something.Wee didnt disclose the number of paying Techlist customers at this point, but he said that over 100 investors have joined in the past month. SoftBank Capital, DeNA and GMO Venture Partners are among the major VC firmson its client roster.As for the longer term future of Techlist and Tech In Asia itself, Wee said he is focused on the potential that he sees in the company rather than an exit.There are alot of other media companies talking to us, but were not ready to sell at the moment, he revealed. We are focused oncontinuing to takeTech In Asia to the next level. If we sell now, our mission willnot be fulfilled.As someone who has written about Asias tech scene for more than fouryears  and has spent time playing with Techlist  I feel Im pretty qualified to say that Techlist is an interesting project that Im keeping my eye on. Wee said that the company is considering packaging trend-oriented data for media to use in the future, so Im hopeful that the service can also help writers like me chronicleAsias rise with more color.Update: Theres been quite adiscussion about the similarities between Techlist and existing VC database CB Insights after visuals from both services were highlighted on Twitter.CB Insights claimed12 of Tech In Asias staff signed up to its free trial over the past six months. The companys CEO Anand Sanwal calledTechlists design one of the more egregious cases of a line being crossed from inspiration to plagiarism.Wee, Tech In Asias CEO, said his company drew inspiration from CB Insights for some of its visuals andapologized directly for the similarities.He told TechCrunch that, though he believes the Techlist business model will bedifferentiated further down the road, his team is developing new visuals for the site which he expects to go live this week.
