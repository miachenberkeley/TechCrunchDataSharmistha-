Techs freshman class of diversity and inclusion leaders gathered at Rev. Jesse JacksonsPUSHTech 2020 conference today to answer the question, What now?Within the last six months,Dropbox, Pinterest, Airbnb, Twitter and Intuit have all hired employees charged with correcting their diversity problems. At Jacksons conference, intended to increase diversity in tech, those newly minted leaders are determiningtheir path forward.The first step, as addiction counselors say, is admitting you have a problem. Most industry-leading companies have alreadymade thatfirst uncomfortableadmission inthe past year, releasing statistics on the lack of women and people of color in their workforces. Now, instead of transparency reports, the trend has shifted to hiring diversity chiefsto fix the problem  preferably from within the communities these leaders will be tasked to represent.Dropbox has had Judith Williams as its global head of diversity since October; Pinterest added Candice Morgan as head of diversity three months ago; Airbnb hired David King as director of diversity less than two months ago,Jeffrey Siminoff joined Twitter as vice president of inclusion and diversity four months ago,and Michelle Angier has been chief diversity officer at Intuit since December.Seeing a new class of diversity leaders hired across the industry feels good, but the big question is what comes next. Unfortunately for data-driven executives, the answer is more nebulous than just getting better percentages out of recruiting and hiring programs. The big change tech needs is a cultural one  and it seems that diversity chiefsare still figuring out how to make it happen.Themost urgent task, of course, is boosting their companies embarrassingly low percentages of minority employees. But a hiring surge alone isnt enough to trigger a culture shift  andfixing the culture that allows women engineers to be harassed out of their jobs or managers to suggestbuilding a tool to guess the ethnicity ofjob applicants by their last nameswill take more than just a fresh group of new hires.To get employees to stick around, diversity leaders are focusing oninclusion.Morgan and her peers say theyre using a mix of employee resource groups, unconscious bias training, and ally outreach to keep diverse employees from leaving.But theres still so much more to be done, says Airbnbs David King.One of the first conversations [at Airbnb] was about women in tech, King explained. But people werent talking about race. Disability wasnt mentioned at all.Theres resistance among legacy employees who worry theyll be excluded or that they dont have the knowledge base to comfortably join a conversation about diversity. Some employees feel like they dont fit in with the left-leaning politics in their workspaces  King cited the example of a Trump-supporting Airbnb employee who felt excluded from workplace chatter about politics.Even after all the culture work is done, diversity leaders still dont think theyll have convinced everyone in their organizations to be more inclusive.Judith Williams says she believes 10-15 percent of Dropboxs employees will never be supportive of her diversity mission. But, she adds, if she can get support from employees who are invested in diversity or neutral on the subject, You can create a culture where those who will never support you have to be quiet about it.Diversity heads are beginning to look beyond their employees as well.Although users might not be concerned about the diversity of the engineers who build their favorite products, those engineers are encouraged to consider the diversity of their users.Airbnb wants its customers to see it as a company that provides an importanteconomic opportunity to black communities, not as a company that enables hosts to discriminate against travelers with African-American names.Twitter wants to be viewed as the company that helped amplify the Black Lives Matter movement, not as the place where female video game developers face a deluge of rape and death threats.Even as change comes at these companies, the shift for users still seems aspirational.The plans proposed today represent a strong industry-wide start at adjusting workplace culture. But, with all these diversity leaders still brand-new in their roles, its not clear how hard they can push for change.At the end of todays panel on diversity, an audience member stood up and asked the group if executive compensation was tied to corporate diversity goals. One by one, the panelists answered no.
