In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, and amid ongoing operations to catch the perpetrators, with fears of further attacks swirling secure messaging app Telegram has shuttered a swathe of public channels that it says were being used to broadcast what it dubbed ISIS-related content.In an update posted on its public channel yesterday, Telegram News, the company writes that it was disturbed to learn that Telegramspublic channels were being used by ISIS tospread their propaganda  something it says it learned after receiving reports sent to it by users at the abuse@telegram.org email address  and adding that it has blocked 78 ISIS-related channels operating in 12 different languages this week alone.This week we blocked 78 ISIS-related channels across 12 languages. More info on our official channel: https://t.co/69Yhn2MCrK Telegram Messenger (@telegram) November 18, 2015It added that it would be introducing an easier way for users to report objectionable public content in anupcoming app update this week.The messaging app introduced the public broadcast channels back in September, as a replacement for a prior Broadcast lists feature, describing them as a new tool for broadcasting your messages to large audiences, and noting: They can have an unlimited number of members, they can be public with a permanent URL and each post in a channel has its own view counter.Despite the startup expressing apparent surprise at ISIS adoption of its public channels, alsoin SeptemberTelegramco-founder Pavel Durov confirmed in an on stage interview with TechCrunch that ISIS extremists were using the messaging app to communicate. But he said the company remained committed to protecting users privacy  arguing that terrorist groups will always find secure channels to communicate.I dont think we should feel guilty about this. I still think were doing the right thing  protecting our users privacy, he said at the time.As well as privacy, Durov has also been a consistentsupporter offree speech  statingthese are the twin principles guidingthe projects he and his team of engineers develop.Its not clear whether hehas changed his position on eitherprinciple now, in the wake of the Paris attacks, albeitthat seems highly unlikely for such a consistently principled individual.At the time of writing Durov had not responded to a request for comment on Telegramsdecision to purgepublic ISIS channels.However its worth noting that public broadcast channels are a somewhat different communications beastto private communications  given their greater potential reach(hence thechoiceof the word propaganda in the Telegram update, and specific reference to objectionable public content [emphasis mine]).And of course publicly expressed terrorist sentiments are rather harder to accommodateon free speech grounds vs unseen privatemessageswhose specific content remains unknown  even if it issuspected and reviled by default.Update:Durov has now responded to confirm he remains committed to messagingprivacy, telling TechCrunch:We launched public channels in Telegram only a few weeks ago and they have nothing to do with private chats and privacy. In fact, they are something opposite: these are publicly available broadcasts, more like RSS. Since channels represent a completely different means of communication, they require a completely different approach. As for private chats, they were and remain sacred to us. There will be no shift in attitude there.The widerpoliticalpressureTelegram is doubtless hopingto defuse by purgingISIS content from the public face of its messaging platform is fromthe kneejerk response of governments and security agencies onceagain briefing against strong encryption in the wake of the latest terroristattack  in a bid to scapegoat technology anddeflect attention away from their own policy failures.In additional statementsrelating to the clean up of ISIS public channels, Telegram clarified its free speech position on public content as anti-terrorist, but not anti-alternative opinion  provided, of course, the latter is expressed peacefully.While we do block terrorist (eg ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions, it said.For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in a country, Telegram wont be part of such politically-motivated censorship. This goes against our founders principles, it added.Of course its a fine line Telegram is treading here. But thats always the casewhen principles collide with messy, real-world events.Telegramhas seen someimpressive engagementgrowth this year, with the volume of messages sent daily on the platform rising from around 1 billion this February to 12 billion by September, although its monthly active users remained at around the 60 million mark between May and September.
