Another investment for Chinese Internet giant Tencent: its led a $750,000 seed funding round in Baltimore-based Tissue Analytics.Existing investor DreamIt Health  the Philadelphia-based accelerator program for medtechstartups which Tissue Analyticswent through last July (taking pre-seed funding via that program) also participated in the round, along with several healthcare angels also fromthePhiladelphia area.Tissue Analytics is focusing on the niche area of chronic wound care, such as bedsores and diabetic ulcers, usinga smartphone apps camera as amore objective tool for measuring and quantifying wound healing.We are a wound imaging and telehealth company, predominantly. So we look at a very small sub-set of medicine called chronic wounds, says co-founder Kevin Keenahan. This field is sort of archaic in the way patients are managed, its been a very traditionally underserved area of medicine. Were trying to modernize it by increasing the care co-ordination capabilities but also find a more objective way to evaluate these wounds.The idea for the business came afterthe founders spent time on a grad program for medtech innovation  which getsengineers to rotate through different clinical environments to identify problems that could also be business opportunities.The only good way that doctors or nurses have today to demonstrate that a wound is healing is using a ruler to measure the dimensions of the wound, he adds. This technique is so variable and prone to error  the measurement is so noisy that doctors cant actually determine if a wound is healing, or if the treatments working, so they kind of just rely on guess work. And visual approximation. So we want to bring a decimal level of understanding of the actual status of wound healing.Tissue Analytics approach allows for wound data to be collected via its smartphone app by the nurseswho Keenahan says typically manage these sorts of patients in nursing homes and home care groups, and then have that data sent automatically to its web portal  where specialist doctors are able to log in tomanage multiple patients remotely.So its a telemedicine tool with Tissue Analytics aim being to bring aradiology-style approach to the field of chronic wound care.The whole idea behind the concept is to try to make wound-care more like radiology where one specialist can manage patients from all across the region, he notes.From a photo, right now, we can determine the surface area [of a wound], the contraction rates, the length and width measurements  so most of what the nurses would do today  and we do segment tissues. We dont put clinical labels on them at this point but we can actually present some more advanced information to clinicians today, he adds.The startups technology is currently focused on enabling the gathering of accurate wound data via smartphone so human specialists can make decisions about patient care, howeverKeenahan says it sees potential for the technology to take on more of adiagnostic role in future.We are walking a line as far as being a diagnostic device, he tells TechCrunch. I guess theres two phases; what we can launch immediately, and what we are collecting data for for future regulatory submissions. What were launching immediately is some more basic processing  its a lot around color correction, and simple measurements. All the future work that were doing is much more around predictive analytics and making a diagnosis  a specific diagnosis  about the status of wound healing. And eventually even suggesting therapies.The team behind the appspun out of the Center for Bioengineering Innovation &Design at Johns Hopkins University in spring 2014  having worked on the underlyingimage analysis techniques as part of theirthesis atthe universitylaunching a limited beta version of the app at Johns Hopkinslast November, and rolling out a more open beta thisApril. Customer numbers are not being broken out at this point.Keenahan says the new funding will largely be used for a study its doing in conjunction with Penn Medicine to evaluate the economic impact of its system  which ultimately will form its SaaS sales pitch to healthcare and insurance companies.Were looking at total wound healing time, the rate of wound closure,were looking at hospital readmissions, were looking at infection rates, amputation rates, and then the total healthcare expenditures. So hopefully well be able to tip the needle on the majority of those categories, he notes.While the initial focus for Tissue Analytics is the U.S. market,Keenahan is keen to point out the impact of chronic wounds in emerging markets and the potential for the technology to be applied more widely. One of the aspects were particularly excited about is the tremendous impact that diabetic ulcers have in the developing world, he says, noting what can be far higher health costs of managing the condition in a country like India vs the U.S., for example.We are really excited in working with some of the companies in [Tencents] portfolio that could help us start to look at the developing world as a real market, he adds.
