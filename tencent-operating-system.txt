Tencent today unveiled an operating system for smartwatches, TVs and other Internet-connecteddevices today. The system, which was first discussed last year, leverages Tencents hugely population social services, which includes QQ and mobile messagingapp WeChat.The Tencent OSand TOS+ is available to be licensed without cost, like Googles Android. Tencent launcheda platform for smartphonesback in January, but this new software is focused on wearables and other Internet-connected devices, such as smartwatches, wearables and smart TV sets.Speaking at the GMIC event in Beijing, Tencent COO Mark Ren said the platform offered a more social option that could be used to make money using third-party services while taking advantage of integrated social services from Tencent.Tencent is not the first to jump on this opportunity. Alibaba launched a smart home businessfocused on turning any device or utility into a smart one, while it already uses its Yun OS  which is being adopted by Meizu, a smartphone maker that Alibaba invested in. Xiaomi toohas a platform of hardware companies those devices are sold within its Mi.com online store, and optimized for its smartphones.That said, just launching a new platform doesnt turn it into a success. Baidu, for one, closed down its Android ROM last month due to lack of interest. TheChinese giant may have opted out of mobile, but it did acquire ROM makerDianxin indicating that it does still have aspirations in this space. Samsung is still trying to sell developers onTizen, but theoperating system has yet to become a viable competitor to Android.
