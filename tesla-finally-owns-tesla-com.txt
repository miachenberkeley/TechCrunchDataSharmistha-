Tesla.com is now in the hands of Elon Musk. Stu Grossman owned the domain since 1992 but it mostly sat unused. As of February 19, 2016, it redirects visitors to TeslaMotors.com and all is right with the world.The story goes that Grossman bought the domain because of his affinity to the legendary engineer. Apparently he was going to turn it into a fan site. That didnt happen.The details of the ownership switch have not been announced. Its unclear if Tesla Motors bought the domain from Grossman or if the company scooped it up another way. Either way, as many companies can attest, its a big win for Tesla. Right, Apple?
