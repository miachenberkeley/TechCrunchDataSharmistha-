We just got the official word: Tesla is announcing something tomorrow.What is that something? We actually have no idea at the moment. Id love to say YEAH! GET HYPED! NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL BE SUPER INTERESTING! for the sake of readership  but I cant really do that, because Tesla is keeping details super sparse.Could it be that Tesla has finally locked down the ship dates for itselectric SUV, the Model X? Perhaps.Could it be something more ridiculous? Its possible!Of course, its also possible that its something mundane; worth noting is that Tesla is pulling in reporters via the phone, rather than an in-person press conference, which generally suggests that photos/videos/visuals wont be super important. With that said, Tesla announcements generally dont disappoint.Whatever the case  swing by tomorrow at just after 11 am Pacific for details on whatever it is theyre announcing. (Update: Heres the news.)
