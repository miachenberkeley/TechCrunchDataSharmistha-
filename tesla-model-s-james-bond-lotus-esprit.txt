The Tesla Model S is one helluva car  but it cant do everything. It cant recharge as fast as you could fill a tank of gas. It cant go over 155 miles per hour. Oh, and it cant transform into a submarine and cruise around underwater.With this awesome little easter egg, though, that last one becomes a bit less certainYou see, Elon Musk is a bit of a James Bond fan.Specifically, hes a fan of Bonds submersible Lotus Esprit from 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me  so much so, in fact, that he dropped nearly a million dollars in an auction for the movie prop. His eventual goal? To convert the prop (which, sadly, doesnt do much besides look cool) into an actual, functional submersible vehicle.In a nod to this, Tesla engineers have hidden a most excellent easter egg within the Model S 17-inch touchscreen. Check it out:Note that theres a Jules Verne nod in there, too, with one of the Depth options being 20,000 leagues  as in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.For comparisons sake, heres what that screen usually looks like:And heres the Bond scene that inspired it all:(Note: This doesnt actually make the Model S a submersible, so please dont drive that $80,000 car into the ocean. Also, anti-aircraft missiles are not included.)[via Jalopnik]
