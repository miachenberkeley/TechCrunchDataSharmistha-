A few days ago, Elon Musk pledged to end range anxiety for Model S owners by way of an over-the-air software update.Today, hes detailed how he plans to do that.The short version: the Model S will now run constant calculations (regardless of whether or not youre using the built in turn-by-turn system) on how far you are from a supercharger.If you are about to drive too far from a supercharger to make it back to one, the car will warn you. This makes it effectively impossible for a driver to run out of range unintentionally, says Musk. The car will actually double check; youll have to say Yes, Im sure twiceThe Model S already tries to estimate how much charge youve got left on your battery; itll also tell you how far you are from the nearest supercharger. This update really just ties those two points together, as well as some outside data, to put a big ol warning sign up when youre about to drive just a little too far.The system will also now have a built-in trip planner, which allows you to route long distance trips with superchargers in mind. The range estimator here will factor in things like the additional energy needed for climbing up windy mountain passes, as well as real-time data like high-wind speed.The new range assurance system is coming in Version 6.2, along with features like automatic emergency braking and a valet mode that tones back the cars performance before you hand it off to a valet. Things start to get crazy, though, with Version 7   thats when the first auto-pilot, self-steering functionality will arrive.
