Were just about an hour away from Teslas quarterly earnings calls, but the news is already starting to trickle out.The biggest detail so far: you know the Model 3? Teslas more affordable car, meant to bring their entry-level line down to roughly $35,000?Were finally going to see what it looks like, and hopefully a bit about just what it can do, on March 31st.News of the scheduled unveiling comes by way of a pre-call press release, which mentions the Model 3 ever so briefly:These investments will help prepare the way for Model 3, which is on schedule to be unveiled on March 31st and to start production and deliveries in late 2017.March 31st will also be the date that pre-orders for the new vehicle open up, too. Word of that comes from the top, via a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who added that onlineregistration will kick off on April 1st. Not a hoax, we assume.In both cases, would-be owners will need to lay down $1,000 to cash to kick the ordering process off.Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 11, 2016
