Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that the company intended to show off the Model 3  its most affordable car to date by far, at $35,000  in March of 2016. But as weve learned from the companys adventures with the Model X, Tesla stuff can most definitely get delayed.With that said: good news, Model 3 hopefuls! The Model 3 is still on track for an unveiling in March of 2016.The progress update comes by way of Teslas Q3 2015 shareholder letter, in which Elon and Co. make but one fleeting mention of the Model 3:Operating expenses should increase slightly in Q4, but reflect a further decline in Model X development expenses, offset by increased costs related to expanding our global sales capability and developing Model 3. We are on track to unveil Model 3 in late March 2016.Its worth noting, of course, that unveiling doesnt mean release  actual production isnt expected until some time in 2017. Tesla is still knee deep in shipping Model X pre-orders, after all.
