After two years of rumors and rampant speculation, Tesla will unveil the Model 3 tonight.At a target price of $35,000 before government incentives, the Model 3 is meant to be Teslas first car affordable by those of us (read: most of us) who cant drop $70-$100K on a Model S or $80-$130K for a Model X. Besides that price target, theres not much else we know. No one outside of Tesla is even 100 percent certain what it looks like.Tonight that changes, and theyre streaming it all live.Care to follow along?In a nice change of pace from the industry norm, Tesla isnt tucking the livestream away on some hard-to-findURL nested five clicks deep on their site, or making you dig around for it on Facebook.Instead, theyre throwing it right on their homepage, teslamotors.comWell be at the event, bringing back the news as fast as we can  so tune in tonight for all the details.The unveiling is scheduled to kick off at 8:30pm Pacific but Tesla things have a tendency to start a bit late, so plan accordingly.(Fun fact: The Model 3 was, at one point, set to be called the Model E. But then there was a bit of a trademark standoff, and Tesla switched from E to 3. As you can see above, the logo that Tesla settled on is about as close to an E as one can get while still making absolute sense as 3. Heh.)
