Well, this is something you dont see every day. According to a new report out of Consumer Reports, theTesla Model S P85D, all-wheel-drive electric sedan, performed better in our tests than any other car ever has, earning a perfect road-test score.Actually, it did better than that, scoring 103 points in a scoring system that, by definition, doesnt go past 100.Among the many reasons it scored so remarkably high, says the outlet: its brutally quick acceleration (the car soars from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds);better braking and handling than thestandard Model S (which also receives high marks from Consumer Reports); and its stunning energy efficiency. Consumer Reports notes the car gets the equivalent of 87 miles per gallon.Of course, the car isnt perfect, says the report. Its200-plus mile range can bea concernon a long drive if a charging station isnt nearby. (Consumer Reports clearly hasnt heard ofBjrn Nyland, a programmer who recently drove 452.8 miles on a single charge in a P85D by cruising at 25 miles per hour.)Its also louder than the Model S, less opulent than other luxury vehicles, and too expensive for most of us, with a price tag of$127,820.Still, Consumer Reports is calling it an automotive milepost and a powerful statement of American startup ingenuity.Thats one enviable assessment  and it surelyhas the 12-year-old car company celebrating this morning.
