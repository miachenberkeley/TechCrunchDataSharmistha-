Looks like its going to be a rough Saturday for Teslas IT department: theyve just had both their website and Twitter account hijacked.Update, 3:50 P.M: Tesla CEO Elon Musks personal Twitter account was seemingly hijacked briefly around this time, as well.The first signs of the hijacking popped up around 1:52 P.M. pacific, when a tweet from the account declared that it was now under the control of its attackers, and the accounts name was changed from Tesla Motors to #RIPPRGANG.A few minutes later, the account began promising free Teslas to those who followed certain accounts or to those who called a certain phone number. A quick search suggests that the number belongs to a computer repair shop in Illinois, and was presumably tweeted out to flood the numbers owner with calls. Weve censored the number in the above screenshot for obvious reasons.At nearly the same time, Teslas website was edited to declare that itd been hacked by the same attackers. As of 2:15 p.m., the site had been taken offline  but in the hours since, its returned with the hijacked page multiple times. Its Twitter account, meanwhile, still seems to be hijacked. (Weve avoided linking directly to any of the hacked sites in the off chance that the sites themselves were made to compromise the users security.)Update: At around 2:45 P.M pacific, or roughly an hour after the Twitter account was compromised, it was restored. Teslas site is still offline.Its not unusual for a high-profile Twitter account to get hijacked  many of the most followed accounts in the world have fallen at one time or another. Taylor Swifts account, for example, was hacked just weeks ago. That both Teslas Twitter account and the website were hacked simultaneously, though, points to an issue beyond a one-off Twitter security failing.Its unclear if the hack compromised the security of Teslas own servers, or if the site hijacking is a result of something like DNS/domain redirection. Weve reached out to Tesla for comment here.
