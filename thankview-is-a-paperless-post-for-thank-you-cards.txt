Everyone knows that having to write individualizedthank you cards is the worst part of receivinggifts.Luckily, ThankView is fixing this with its platform that lets userssend customized, video thank you cards to each person on your invite list.Heres how it works:After uploading a recipient list, users can choose a theme and customize their e-card with photos, text, and colors. Then, ThankViewvirtually queues up each thank you card, letting users quickly record back-to-backindividual messages to everyone on their invite list.The result is a thank you videowhere you can personally acknowledge each personand their gift, all at a fraction of the cost of sending a handwritten(and arguably less personal) letter through the mail.While the company has different pricing options depending on how many people you are thanking, themid-tier option is 100 ThankViews for $50definitely less than the cost of postage and stationary.While the cost savings are significant, the best part about ThankView may be the time savings. If youre writing thank you cards for a 200 person wedding, and you take two or three minutes per card, youre spending anywhere from sevento tenhours just writing thank you cards.The New York-based company also lets users track thank you cards after being sent, so you can see when your recipient opened and viewed your video message.While the most obvious use case is events likeweddings and birthdays, its also not hard to imagine ThankView serving a purpose in the workplace. Management could use the service to create custom video cards acknowledging milestones or special events in the companys history, all in a fraction of the time as writing a handwritten note.
