The annual base salary reports must have been submitted in U.S. dollars by full-time employees.*Square and Atlassian were listed on CrunchBase as unicorns at the time we pulled this data, and both made it onto the list of 20 top paying unicorns for engineers. However, Square and Atlassian were taken off because Square has since gone public and Atlassian has announced plans to go public.
