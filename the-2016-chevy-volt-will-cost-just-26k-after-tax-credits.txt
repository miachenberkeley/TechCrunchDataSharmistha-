Chevrolet just announced the final pricing for its 2016 Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid, and its surprisingly affordable.If you get the full$7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, the new Volt will come in at $26,495. If you happen to live in California, state-level credits can bring that down to just $24,995. Thats newsworthy because its starting to dip into traditional hybrid price territory; if you look at the closest comparable offerings from Ford, Hondaor Toyota, youre looking at ~$25,000.While those vehicles all get great mileage compared to similarly sized sedans powered solely by internal combustion, the Volt has a massive battery that lets you handle most trips on electricity alone.One of the big selling points for the original Volt was that the vast majority of Americans commutes were less than the vehicles 40-mile range; the 2016 Volts battery allows you to keep going for up to50 miles before the engine has to kick in to power the electric motor.Even with gas prices going down, the fact that you can go weeks without stopping at the pump means youll spend hundreds of dollars less on fuel each year in addition tosaving a bunch of time.If you dont take the applicable state and federal tax credits into account, the 2016 Chevy Volt will come in at $33,995. Thats still $1,200 less than last years model, impressive considering the improved range  and the glacial pace of progress in battery technology.
