Apple has a new beta for iOS 8.2 out today, and the software contains a hint that suggests it could launch publicly alongside the Apple Watch. The mention of the Apple Watch is found in the Bluetooth menu, according to 9to5Mac, where a message at the bottom of the devices list directs users to head to a dedicated Apple Watch app in order to pair their new wearable with their smartphone.The Apple Watch notice is a strong indicator that the wearablewill launch soon, since this is the fourth beta for iOS 8.2, and previous reports suggest well see a March debut window for Apple Watch consumer sales. Apple has already announced the Apple Watch, and referred to an Apple Watch dedicated app, but as of yet theres no official timeline for its release beyond that its coming sometime early this year.The link contained in the Bluetooth menu in iOS 8.2 that points to the Apple Watch app doesnt actually do anything just yet, as the app itself isnt currently available in the App Store. The feature indicates that Apple wants to make it as easy as possible to pair the wearable with their phones, however, and to provide a dedicated onboarding experience which will presumably include setup and configuration tutorials within the Watch app itself.Apples new wearable will be prices starting at $349 when it does become available, and a March timeframe makes sense in terms of giving Apple more to launch throughout the year, rather than bunching all new devices in fall when the iPad, iPhone and multiple Macs are currently refreshed.
