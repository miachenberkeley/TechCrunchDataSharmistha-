Today is Surface 3 review day for hardware kids  video incoming, I promise  meaning that the media is mostly getting its first full day with the new Microsoft tablet hybrid.The device is much as we expected it to be, a less expensive Surface Pro 3 in a smaller package.Most importantly, however, is the simple fact that you dont have to charge the Surface 3. Ever. As Brad Sams of Neowin noted earlier today, if you plug your Surface 3into itself,it claims to charge for some time.
