The Black Tux, a suit and tuxedo rental startupbased in Santa Monica, has scooped upanother $25 million in funding to make sure groomsmenno longerlook like theyre wearing their dads old suits.Led by Stripes Group (also investors in eco-friendly fashion brand Reformation) with participation from prior investors First Round and Menlo Ventures, the Series B comes less than a year after The Black Tux wrapped up a $10 million Series A in January.The current tuxedo rental market is served by the same two manufactures across every retail store in the U.S., says Blackmon. Were talking polyester suits, microfiber shirts, and plastic shoes any guy who has rented before knows the experience.By owning the entire supply chain and bringing all logisticsin-house, including dry-cleaning, tailoring services and inventory management, The Black Tux is able to offer higher-quality garmentsat a lower rate than the going rental tux.The brands suits and tuxedos, made from the same Italian fabric that many top fashion brands work with, start at $95, with the average customer spending around $140.Catering to an on-demand-obsessed generation, The Black Tux walks youthrough an online fitting process that matches yourmeasurements to Black Tux garments using a sophisticated algorithm (yes, seriously). The company askswhat dayyourevent is, ships yoursuit outa week in advance, and promises to overnight you replacement garments (or foot the bill for local tailoring services) if the suit doesnt fit.Considering that the typical tuxedo rental process involves going into the rental store three times  to get fitted, pick up your tux, and drop it off after the event  and sets you back a good $200 bucks, its no surprisethat The Black Tux has grown its customer base into thehundreds of thousandsand repeatedly sold out of inventory since launching in June of 2013, according to Blackmon.This is a multibillion dollar industry thats completely overlooked because its completely unsexy, Blackmon says. Theres little incentive to change because the whole industry is ubiquitous, and most people in the garment or fashion industry dont look at rentals as something they want to disrupt.That being said, Blackmon says The Black Tux plans toexperiment with offering certain items for final sale because customers frequently ask if they can keep the suits theyve rented.The latest tranche of funding brings the companys funding total to $40 million since 2012.
