The standard sets of stock headphones being shipped by companies like Apple and Samsung are, by and large, garbage. For consumers looking to achievemore of a high-end audio experience, their best bet is traditionally in securing a new pair of cans. A new company, BoomCloud 360, is looking to help consumers boost audio quality more easily with their firstportable product offering.The BoomStick, launching for pre-order today, allows consumers a shot at improving the dynamic quality of all of their headphones with the addition of a single, portable device that plugs into a devices headphone jack. Its not your traditional portable headphone amplifier, it actually really changes how your headphones sound.When plugging a standard pair of Apple EarPods into the BoomStick, I was left with a much more satisfying low-end responsiveness in addition to considerably more dynamic vocals and high-end quality. With all of that said, ApplesEarPods definitely arent winning any sound quality awards anyway, yettheheadphones sounded considerably more palatablewith the addition of the BoomStick.Users looking to get a taste of the improvements in sound reproduction offered bythe BoomStick can check out the BoomCloud 360 website to hear their favorite tunes enhanced by the companys technologies.The design of the product itself is fairly unobtrusive. It has a single boom button on the top-side of the unit which allows you to really hear the difference in sound that the BoomStick is producing by toggling the tech on and off. The device sports a pretty hefty 14-hour battery which was generally satisfactory inhandling my music-listening needs.I chatted with BoomCloud 360co-founderGeorge Applingwho told me that he believed the world was desperately in need of a sound renaissance.While TV has made huge strides in terms of quality, from black and white to 4K, audio hasbeen going backwards. In fact, our research shows that only 4 percent of consumers believe they are achieving a great audio experience with their headphones, Appling said in a statement.Consumers shouldnt have to settle for mediocre audio. With theBoomStick, you can make your free earphones outperform expensive headphonesor you can take your expensive headphonesto a wholenew level of enveloping sound.Ultimately the most criticalsell of this product is in convincing consumers that their $99 is better spent on the BoomStick instead of on a more capable pair of headphones. The BoomStick is certainly a high-quality upgrade to users sporting stock earbudsor other less pronouncedheadphones, but for audiophiles its algorithmic sound re-engineering can perhaps strip away the specific sound signatures of headphone brands that ultimately makes them so unique.A bothersome design quirk of the product is the recessed headphone jack, which much like the 3.5mm port of the first iPhone prohibits the use of headphones with more girthy cables. This hindered me from enjoying itsbenefits with all of myheadphones without adding a second adapter into the fray.For casual listeners, these headphones offer bass and high-end upgrades that can present low and mid-end headphones with a major sound upgrade. Standard earbuds from Apple and Samsung can offer experiences more similar to those of Beats and Bose when using the BoomStick device according to the company.This product is probably best for mobile audiophiles looking to get the most out of multiple sets of headphones.The BoomStick will be available for $99 in spring 2016. Its available in black and silver.
