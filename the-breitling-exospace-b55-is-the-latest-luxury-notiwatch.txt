Breitling, maker of fine watches for people who fly airplanes (or would like to fly airplanes), has just released the Exospace B55, a smartwatch that can relay messages from your phone and includes a high-end quartz movement with advanced timing features. This isnt a smart watch per se so Im calling it a notification watch or notiwatch. Go ahead and laugh.Anyway, the B55 is a multifunction electronic chronograph also receives notifications of the smartphones incoming emails, messages (SMS, WhatsApp) or phone calls (with callers name or number) as well as reminders of upcoming appointments. This means the small LCD screen will display names and info when you get a message.The case is made of titanium and it uses the Caliber B55 with a SuperQuartz movement meaning the quartz crystal has been tested at a range of temperatures and situations. Quoth Breitling:Why would you want this over, say, a FitBit? Maybe you fly a plane or maybe you want to pretend to fly planes. Breitling makes some beautiful mechanical pieces  all high shine and gloss  and their electronic pieces are also well known, especially their Emergency series with built in rescue radio that sends a signal when you crash. Everyone is trying their hand at the notiwatch and I doubt anyone will win much market share with these but heck, theyve got to try.
