The 1980s are back again! The guys who bought the Commodore name are releasing an Android smartphone for about $300. The price includes some bog standard specs but, most important, includes two emulators so you can play classic 1980s games right on your screen. The phone will appear in Europe first  including Italy and Poland  but if you remember programming guessing games in grade school or leading a team of mules over a river while not dying of dysentery, this might just be the phone for you.Youll be able to pick up your PET next week if you so desire. Otherwise, just get thee to the emulator.Product Page via Wired
