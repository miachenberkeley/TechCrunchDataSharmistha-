Ready to get your mind blown? You better sit down. So Chris Hawker, creator of the Power Squid is back and he wants to put power near your butt. His new product, the Couchlet, is a foldable USB power system that peeks up between your couch cushions or mattresses and lets you plug in while seated or lying down.I know, right?It costs $16. Heck, for a limited time its actually $16 for two! Still curious as to what it does? It will let you plug in your phone while on the couch. What else do you need to know?Still not convinced? Hold on. Chris writes:Low voltage, right? That means it wont explode when you pour your Manhattan all over it while you have to watch Matilda for the fortieth time with the kids. Still not feeling it? Boom. Origin story:I mean seriously: this thing solves cramped muscles. Its shipping in December 2015 so youll have to hang loose for a while, plugging your phone into the wall like an animal until Christmas, but by gar wont it feel good to finally root around in your couch cushions, find the Couchlet, and plug in? Seriously? Still nothing. Ok. Whatever. Live in the past, cave-person. Im Couchletting.
