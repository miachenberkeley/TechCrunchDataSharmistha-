Disrupt NY, welcome to Brooklyn.TechCrunchs big conference has moved out of Manhattan, into Brooklyns Red Hook neighborhood. The hackathon that opens the event got started to 12:30pm today, with attendees given less than 24 hours to form teams, build products and prepare a presentation for our judges. Theyll compete for a number of prizes including tickets to Disrupt itself.Most of them were local, coming from New York City and New Jersey, but one team, at least, traveled all the way from Italy. Some seemed optimistic about their chances of winning, while others were a little less confident. Everyone, however, seemed excited to be here  even if that meansbringing sleeping bags for the all-night grind.
