UPDATE: All services have returned and a Google spokesperson provided us with the following statement:Google Drive, Docs editors and Classroom have been restored for 99.5% of affected users as of 1:01 PM Pacific, and for the remaining 0.5% of users by 2:10 PM Pacific. During the event, our top priority was to restore service. We are now turning our attention to understanding what caused the outage; our preliminary diagnosis is that this was caused by a code push which behaved differently in widespread use than it had during testing. If you were affected, we apologize for the disruption this caused. We are calculating the impact to our business customers and will issue SLA credits as appropriate. Full details will follow in our incident report.
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG.If youve noticed that Google Drive and all of the apps that save to it are acting a bit shaky today, youre not alone. Google updated their Apps status page to show that the company is looking into reported issues.Its showing up as a service disruption so nothing is down completely. But nothing is loading either.What do you mean Google Drive is down?

NOOO!!!

Both for my personal account and business account.So you know. Heres your daily reminder: Always be local.Weve reached out to Google for further comment and will update once we hear back.UPDATE: The hell isnt over yet folks, but things are working AOK for me.
