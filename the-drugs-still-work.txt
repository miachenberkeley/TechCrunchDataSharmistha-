An estimated $5 billion worth of prescription medicationgets burned up, flushed down the drain, or thrown in the garbage each year. About$2 billion worth of itjust sits on the shelf at long-term care facilities in the United States until it expires, according toUniversity of Chicagoresearchers.Thats a terrible waste, considering prescription medication is one of the highest costs in our healthcare system and that one in four families in the United Statescant afford to pay for those prescribed medications.SIRUM(Supporting Initiatives to Redistribute Unused Medicine) is a Y Combinator-backed nonprofit that operates out of the Haas Center at Stanford University. Its apatent-pending software platform that acts as a sort of on-demandinventory for pharmacies and care facilities to make it easier to redistribute the otherwiseunused medications to patients who cant afford topay for their prescriptions each year.The law varies from state to state but 42states and Guam currently havesome sort of Good Samaritan program for donated, unused, unexpired medications to low-income patients with a valid prescription.There are state-run drug-donation facilities and other third-party programs, such as DisposeMy Medsto locate placesto donate this unused medicine in eacharea, as well.SIRUM works with thesedrug donation facilities, pharmacies, nursing homes and clinics as a peer-to-peer redistribution platform that cuts out third-party networks. Instead it lets each organization uploaddata on their medical surpluses and needs on the platform in order to find a match for patients in need at that moment.SIRUMco-founders Kiah Williams, George Wang and Adam Kircher estimate the service has helped redistributeabout $3 million worth of unopened, unexpired pills to 20,000 low-income patients since its start in 2011.With funding from Y Combinator, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, and Google.org, SIRUM is currently operating within California, Oregonand Coloradoat the moment. Itplansto eventually open in all 50 states.
