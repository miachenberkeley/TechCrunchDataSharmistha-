Three years after its original eBike the Porteur, Faraday Bicyclesislaunching its second luxury eBike, the Cortland.Now available for preorder on Kickstarter,the Cortland will bring a better battery (290Wh for 25 miles of assisted riding), a more efficient motor, and better software to the line of bikes.The new bike also has an option to attach an auxiliary battery pack under the seat, adding 20 miles to the Cortlands maximum range.Cortland also features hydraulic disc brakes,an 8-speed gear hub, and built-in, 4W LED headlights.While the body of the bike has slightly changed, the Cortland still maintains the simplistic, lightweight design thatFaraday pioneered with the Porteur. With a battery hidden inside the frame, both the new and old models looks like regular bikes  an important feature forbikerswho may have beenhesitant to make the leap to eBikes for aesthetic reasons.Plus, the bike weighs only 40 pounds, making it one of the lightest eBikes on the market.Faraday also announced they are adding an option to add GPS tracking to new and old models, which will interface with the Faraday app that also lets you updatepower settings, trackrides and adjusting your lights.The Cortland is available for preorder now in two models, the Cortland for $2,999 and the less expensive Cortland S for $1,999, which trades thehydraulic disc brakes for mechanical ones, and the carbon belt drive for a chain drive. The Kickstarter campaign ends in a week, but has already blown past its goal of $100,000.
