Apple is rolling out its first software update for the Apple Watch, which brings the Watch OS to version 1.0.1. This update is designed to provide general bug fixes and performance improvements, and also adds display support for the new Emoji characters added to both iOS and OS X in recent updates.To get the new software on your Watch, you can follow the simple process detailed in Apples knowledge base article on the subject, or follow the simple steps below.This update includes improved performance for Siri, stand activity measurement (which would sometimes register a need to stand while standing) and better calorie burn calculations, as well as improved support of distance and pace measurement during outdoor workouts and better support for third-party apps.Apple also added support for seven more languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Russian, Thai and Turkish.After successfully updating my own device, Ive noticed no problems and was able to use the new Emoji as advertised. Performance of apps in general seems more reliable, too, but well keep you updated as we spend more time with the new OS version.
