Things can get messy if you have sex on your period, so many couples avoid it. But The Flex Company wants to replace outdated pads and tampons with a sleek, disc-shaped blood blocker. Flex can be worn during sex to prevent making a mess.TheFlex discs are disposable, can be worn for up to 12 hours and even come in a stylish little packet. Theyre doctor-approved to be hypoallergenic, BPA-free and they wont cause toxic shock syndrome.Flex will open for pre-orders in April and ship in September. 20,000 people have already signed up to try it. Eventually they could be sold in stores, though the price isnt public yet. For now, you can register on The Flex Companys site for a free sample.Flex is so shockingly comfortable that women tell us they forget theyre on their period while theyre wearing it, CEO Lauren Schulte says.Flexwasnt planning its big media push until August, but I thought it was the stand-out company from the Y Combinator startup accelerators Fellowship Virtual Demo Day. The company is funded by Amplify.LA.In her pitch, Flexs Schulte explains Weve built a product that allows couples to increase their opportunity to have sex by 23 percent. The great tragedy of people avoiding sex on their period is that this is really the time when women want it most.Thats why 25 percent of its trial signups are from men!While TechCrunchs female writers didnt love how Flexs marketing hinges on the idea that periods are gross, some said theyd try it. Flex will have to compete with SoftCups, a well-distributed brand with a similar product, though one that doesnt focus on portability or sex.
