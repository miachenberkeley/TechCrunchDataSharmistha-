Editors Note:Peter Csathyis the chief executive officer and an investor forthe business accelerator and development firm Manatt Digital Media.The firm is an investor in DanceOn and advises Whistle Sports.2014 proved to be a transformational year for content-driven digital mediaand investment (a new golden age of content I predicted for TechCrunchat the beginning of this year).For the first time, that investment (muchof it SoCal-based) finally took its rightful place in the sun even in theeyes of ever-skeptical NorCal venture capitalists.It was easy to see why,given megadeals like Disney Studios buying leading multi-channelnetwork (MCN) Maker Studios for up to $1 billion, Facebook buying virtual-reality company Oculus VRfor $2 billion, Microsoft uploading Minecraftmaker Mojang for $2.5 billion, Apple buying Dr. Dres Beats for nearly $3billion, and Amazon snatching up live gamer site Twitch for $1 billion.Five deals totaling roughly $10 billion.What does thisportend for 2015? Certainly, accelerating digitalmedia activity and a continued investor focus - meaning billions of dollars of new bets placedby VCs, strategic investors and acquirers on content-driven opportunities.Beyond that, here are a few specific thoughts on whats in store for the content landscape over the next year:(1) The mobile-driven, premium, short-form video economygrows up, and traditional media companies take noticeon a mass scale. Shell-shocked studio executives internalize thatdigital-first platforms are where they must be to reachsmartphone-obsessed millennials. MCN acquisitions will quickenas more studios jump into the M&A game rather than try tofigure out this new content platform themselves.Some leadingMCNs ripe for acquisition include foodie-focused Tastemade,dance-focused DanceOn, Latino-focused Mitu, sports-focusedWhistle Sports, and Collective Digital Studio.International also becomes a major new battleground for theseborderless video opportunities (European media company RTLGroups $150-$200 million acquisition of U.S.-based fashion-focused MCN StyleHaul is a recent indicator of more to come).(2) Major consumer brands follow suit and act in earnest.Massivemarketing dollars shift from traditional media to moremeasurable digital platforms in the form of branded content (notjust ads), cannibalizing the former for the first time. Majorinvestments are placed on ad-tech companies to maximize andmeasure those spends.We see a number of significant ad-techexits like Yahoos recent acquisition of BrightRoll for $640million. Several brands go further and invest big to becomedigital-first lifestyle media companies themselves a la Red Bull,developing and aggregating content. GoPro, Pepsi and Marriotthave proudly announced such ambitions.(3) YouTube comesunder siege fromcompeting videoplatforms like Facebook andVessel. These off YouTube platforms lure content creatorsaway with promises of more compelling care, feeding andeconomics (including the tantalizing prospect of real subscriptionrevenues).(4) Traditional pay TV packages likewisecomeunder firein the Great Unbundling that began in 2014.What wasunthinkable just one year ago (even 6 months ago!) becamereality as HBO, CBS, Starz and others announced stand-aloneover-the-top (OTT) services. A parade of others follow suit in2015 (which is not all bad for cable companies that benefit fromthe thirst for larger pipes).(5) Media and tech companies will literally converge.Facing these tectonic shifts in long-established business models traditional media companies and major tech companies, which find content increasinglycritical to fuel their own businesses, take M&A seriously.Onewill pullthetrigger on a big deal.(6) On the music side, businesses move away from stand-alone services.Massive moves are made away from businessmodel-challenged stand-alone services (Spotify and Pandora bothstill operate at a loss). Like Apple buying Beats (which was neverabout the economics of Beats Music), numerous potentialbehemoth buyers exist.(7) Gamers see real action too.App developers increasingly focus on story-telling and compelling characters to build multi-platformmedia companies a la Rovio with Angry Birds. Rather than taketraditional media properties and gamify them, these companiesflip the model with an Apps-first approach.Finnish-basedSilvermile and Seriously are two companies with Rovio roots totake  well  seriously. VR also enters the ring with gamers enmasse in 2015.(8) Gamers take towearables. We see an Oculus under everyhard core gamers tree next year, alongside their parents newdigital health and fitness watches.
