HTCs $799 Vive virtual reality headsetopened for pre-orders this morning. The headset will begin shippingApril 5 in the U.S.,just a week or so after the consumer launch of the Oculus Rift, which launches March 28.Pre-orders can be placed on the HTC sitefor shipment to the U.S. and 23 other countries.The $799 package includes the headset, a pair of controllers and two Lighthouse laser-tracking sensors. The bundlealso includes (while supplies last) a trio of quick-and-fun games that show off some of the flexibility offered by the Vives room-scale tracking and motion-tracking: office destructionphysics game Job Simulator, whimsical puzzle game Fantastic Contraption and Googles 3D painting tool Tilt Brush.Ive tried the Vive quite a fewtimes and have loved what Ive seen. It offers a much more rich out-of-the-boxexperience than the Oculus Rift, thanks to its included wireless motion controllers, which allow you to move your virtual hands with ease. The $599Rift currently includes an Xbox controller as its primary input device; the companyhas not yet announced a ship date for its similarly featured Touch wireless motion controllers.Worth reiterating is that you need a gaming PC with decent specs to power the Vive; HTC recommendsthat your PC rocks a Nvidia GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290 graphics card (at a minimum). Valvehas put together a nice little system checker to see how well your PC can run VR content, so if you have any questions about yourspecific rig, best to give the system test a whirl. HTC has specifiedthey will likely follow Oculuss move and begin selling VR-ready PCs bundled alongside the headset, but nothing has been announced yet.
