The other day I was writing an article and I wanted to link to a piece I wrote when I was at CITEworld in 2013  just twoyears ago. I went searching for it, but soon discovered that IDG, the publications owners had taken the site down  and all of its content with it. While this was one small example, it illustrates the issues we have around contentpreservation on the internetIn fact, on a personal level much of my writing from this entirecentury is simply gone. I could have preserved each article Ive written, of course, if I could keep up and remember to do it. Evernote or similar service provides a way for me tocapture web pages  but the archiving onus shouldnt be on individuals like me.If the internet is at its core is a system of record, then it is failing to completethat mission. Sometime in 2014, the internet surpassed a billion websites, while it has since fallen back a bit, its quite obviously an enormous repository.When websites disappear, all of the content is just gone as though itnever existed, and that can have a much bigger impact than you imagine on researchers, scholars or any Joe or Josephine Schmosimply trying to follow a link.Granted, some decent percentage of those pages probably arentworth preserving (and some are simply badinformation), but that really shouldnt be our call. It should all be automatically archived, a digital Library of Congressto preserve and protect all of the contenton the internet.As my experience shows, you cant rely on publishers to keep a record. When it no longer serves a websiteowners commercial purposes, the content can disappear forever. The trouble with that approach is it leaves massive holes in the online record.Cheryl McKinnon, an analyst with Forrester Research, who covers content management, has been following this issue for many years. She says the implications of lost content on the internet could be quite profound.So much of our communication and content consumption now  whether as individuals, as citizens, as employees  is online and in digital form. We rely on publishers (whether entertainment, corporate, scientific, political) that have moved to predominantly, if not exclusively, digital formats. Once gone or removed from online access we incur black holes in our [online] memory, she said.This leads directly to another problem: link rot. You click a link to an article and get a message that the page is gone or you get directed to an entirely different site from the same content owner. This has actually become a serious issue, McKinnon said. The footnotes and backup evidence weve been relying on for the last decade is very precarious and subject to the [whim of] third parties hosting it, she said.In fact, in 2013 the ABA Journal, a publication for the legal professional, reported that link rot has become such a widespread problemin the legal profession that its having an enormous impact on legal research. A 2013 study (PDF), published in the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, found that nearly one-third of the websites cited by the U.S. Supreme Court were nonfunctioning, many of which linked to government or education domains, the ABA article reported.And its not just law, this online amnesia can extend across disciplines, saysJason Scott, Free Range Archivist at the Internet Archive. This [Internet] memory loss extends to science, law, education, and all sorts of other cultural aspects that depend on referencing a stable and informative past to build our knowledge for the present. The loss is pernicious, because we dont immediately notice it  its only over time we realize what we have lost, he said.Its not all bleak, however, The organization Scott works for, TheInternet Archive is attempting to capture, at least a snapshot of the content on the Internet. Ive found some, of my CITEworld content on its Wayback Machine, the archive it keeps of web pages dating back to its earliest days.McKinnon calls the folks at Internet Archive heroes for what they are doing (and I agree).The Internet Archives efforts to archive social media and other sites in shut-down mode are simply awe inspiring. They act when the founders/investors cant or wont, she said.Scott seems to recognize that its going to take more than his organizations efforts, and that we need to formalize archiving as part of the website lifecycle. Whether its laws, expectations, or serving by example; the ability to export and store ones own generated data, and for companies to have shutdown policies that recognize theyve left history, bold moves must be taken. In the meantime, its still somewhat luck and opportunity that saves sites before they disappear, he said.The Internet Archive is a valiant effort, but it isnt perfect. While its atrivial matter finding an archived site if you know its name, its more of a challengefinding individual authors or content by keywords and the internal search tools of archived sites dont seem to work.McKinnon says there are companies and individuals working on this problem. She points to companies like Preservica, which offers digital archiving solutions andHanzo, a company founded to commercialize web archiving technologyas a couple of examples.In some cases, individual organizationshave taken it upon themselves, as The Museum of Modern Art in New York is doing.It has a plan to archive all of its exhibition websites, dating back to its earliest attempts in 1995. This has taken a huge fundraising effort to make happen, however.While all of these are game attempts, what we really needis an organization backed by the internet community with funding and tools to formalize the archiving and preservation process. This would allowevery websitethat wants to participate toeasily back up their sites to a central repository with a fewlines of code.Nobody should experience what I did the other day, going to look for a pagethats only a couple ofyears old, and finding that its disappeared. Content preservation should not be the soleresponsibility of individuals or businesses. We have to find a way to make it an official part of the coding process.If we can send bots out to index the internet, it seems we should be able to find an automated technological solution to preserve content for future generations. At the very least, we are duty bound to try.
