Shortly after the recent Office Of Personal Management data hack, word surfaced on the Dark Net  essentially the hidden Internet  that some of the personal records were for sale. According to security expert Brian Krebs, however, this data could be less damaging than first thought. This is not to say the release of any personal information isnt a catastrophe. However, according to Krebs, the data for sale came from one organization, the Federal Prison Industries also known as Unicor.gov.Earlier this week, miscreants who frequent the Hell cybercrime forum (a Deep Web site reachable only via the Tor network) began passing around a text file that contained more than 23,000 records which appeared to be a user database populated exclusively by user accounts with dot-gov email addresses, wrote Krebs. This data seems to be unconnected with the recent Chinese breach of the OPM and the subsequent theft of tens of thousands of pieces of government data. However, its clear that the Hell hackers are interested in making it seem like they have access to that data.Instead what they probably have is data from Unicor.gov. By simply checking the email addresses in the data Krebs is fairly certain that these are in fact the spoils of an another intrusion of government servers in 2013. He asked Unicor and received this response:The website software was Adobes ColdFusion. Yes. Really. Regardless, it seems that recent OPM breach hasnt led to a sale of the stolen data and is instead an alleged effort by the Chinese government to collect intelligence on US employees. Cold(Fusion) comfort, to be sure, but at least the stolen data is still relatively safe.
