When the first 3Doodler came out it was almost an instant hit. The pen-like plastic extruding system let anyone with a little creativity make fun 3D objects. Now the product just got better.The company has just announced a new version of the device, called the 3Doodler 2.0, on Kickstarter and theyve already far surpassed their $30,000 goal.The new device supports ABS and PLA plastics and has two extruding speeds. You can also lock the extruder so it squirts out plastic constantly. Although my early efforts with this thing werent very good (I was able to make a wobbly box), with a little practice, I found that this thing can be a really fun way to make 3D projects.Early-bird models are sold out, but there are still $85 community models available. Remember: its for 12-year-olds and older so dont hand it over to your toddler (or 40-year-old man) and expect them not to burn themselves. I learned that the hard way when I put the extruder tip on my tongue.
