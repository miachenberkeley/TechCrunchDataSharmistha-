Youve probably noticed; on-demand pharmacy services are springing up like daisies. New York-based Zipdrug, for example, is an online app that processes customers payments and dispatches messengers to pick up their medicine for a $10 delivery service fee. The company has so far raised more than $2.6 million in seed funding from Notation Capital, Lux Capital, and Collaborative Fund, among others.A better-funded upstart is PillPack, a full-service pharmacy that delivers pre-sorted pills packaged individually on a tape-dispenser-like roll to customers every two weeks. It has mostly operated as an online platform, but after raising $50 million last year led by CRV, its opening small brick and mortar locations, too, where patients can consult with licensed pharmacistsand more people can learn ofthe company.Online pharmacyScriptDashformed around the same opportunity last spring.None arestoppingyet anothernew entrant fromgearing up to compete with them. Instead,RobinHealth a 10-month-old, San Francisco-based startup that has already raised an undisclosed amount of seed fundingwill be pitching investors at theMarch 1, invite-only demo day of NFX Guild, a Bay Area accelerator program that graduated its first batch of startups last summer. (Weve written about NFXhere.)Unsurprisingly, perhaps, RobinHealthsays that its different. Itsbig idea: to providing on-demand access to licensed pharmacists around the clock, and todeliver on-demand to customers  within an hour. Those consultations and deliveries are free, offset by increased operational efficiencies in fulfilling the meds, says the company.RobinHealth is working with a pharmacy right now toward that end, but it plans to eventually build out its own network of tiny pharmacies. Says CEO and cofounder Elliot Poppel, Set-up isnt that complex. If you have a pharmacist, you can open your own pharmacy.Asked howRobinHealthdiffers from PillPack specifically, Poppel, a former VC turned operator, tells us in part that PillPack is going after mail order. Were going after retail pharmacy.One way to do that isto focusheavily on the hand-holding that most customers no longer get from pharmacists at major pharmacy chains. Were putting a pharmacist in their pocket, says Poppel of RobinHealths app.Pillpack is also going after older customers, while RobinHealth is going after families andparents in particular, says NFX co-founder James Currier, a serial entrepreneur who says he especiallylikes that RobinHealth is a conversational commerce company, meaning itprimarily touches its usersvia a live messaging interface.Of course, its very early days for all of these startups, whose economics may not be crystal clear but whose appeal is plain,considering the generally dissatisfying, traditional experience of driving to a pharmacy and waiting in line for medication (sometimeswhile not feeling well and often to be told the drugs wont be available straightaway).The market that companies like RobinHealth are pursuing is enormous, too.In 2014, the sale of prescription drugs in the U.S. reportedly totaled a whopping $263 billion.CVS filledabout 23.7percentof those prescriptions.Walgreens and Rite Aid combining to fill about 22percent.
