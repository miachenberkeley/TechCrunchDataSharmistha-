Robots. They can wipe the floor with us at Flappy Bird, Ping Pong, and chess.At least weve still got the last great bastion of human sportsmanship that is beer pong, right? Wrong.Built by Empire Robotics to show off yet another thing that their trippy spherical robot gripper hand is capable of, watch on as it destroys the competition in one flawless turn.If youre not familiar with Empire Robotics Versaball robot, its worth checking out just for the oh damn, thats clever moment youll have when you realize how the gripper is able to pick stuff up.The short version of how it works: that ball is stuffed with a sand-like material. They push air into the ball, allowing the sand to move easily within. They push the air-filled ball onto whatever object needs to be gripped  then suck the air out of the ball. Remove the air, and the sand has nowhere to move. Now it has a perfectly-formed grip on whatever it was wrapped around.As a bonus, the ball itself is made of a cut resistant material  so even when inflated, sharp things like knives and broken glass shouldnt hurt it too much.Empire Robotics will have a booth at CES, where challengers will be able to take it on head-to-head. Alas, unlike a human challenger, the robot probably doesnt get worse after a few too many rounds.[PopSci via Giz]
