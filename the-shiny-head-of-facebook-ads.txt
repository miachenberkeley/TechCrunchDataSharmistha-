Facebook has become the supermassive black hole of mobile. Its sucking every other business towards it, from publishers to small businesses to app developers. At this point, you ever figure out how to play nice with Facebook, or fade into the void. Thats why TechCrunch is bringing Facebooks ad czar Andrew Boz Bosworth to Disrupt SF. Hes going to break down Facebooks plans and how theyll impact everyone else.At the top of my list of questions for Boz is how Facebook is handling the decrease in reach of the News Feed, and what that means for businesses who buy ads, and those who dont.Years ago, Facebook told businesses to buy ads encouraging people to Like their Pages in order to talk to them via News Feed. But that investment has been devalued as competition decreases organicfeed reach. Now Pages are being hit up for money again just to communicate with fans they already paid for. I want to know if Boz and Facebook think thats fair.Well also debate:Freebooting  How will Facebook deal with Pages scrape other peoples videos and publish them as their own?Compensating Creators  Will Facebook pay top artistic talent to share on its network?News Publishers  Should news outlets give up their relationship with fans to load faster in Facebooks Instant Articles?Virtual Reality  Do ads belong in VR?And a whole lot more. One great thing about Boz is that hes brave enough, and has been at Facebook long enough (9 years) to actually speak his mind. Get ready for aspirited conversation on stage at Disrupt SF.
