Weve been waiting for an official Star Wars virtual reality experience for some time. With the movie coming out next month, that time is almost now. In an announcement today on StarWars.com, we got some updates on what to expect.Heres what they had to say:Coming on December 2 is a new virtual reality experience developed along with Google and Verizon. This will feature the first-of-its-kind serialized Google Cardboard Virtual Reality (VR) experience that combines a compelling story, which ties directly into the opening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with the very latest cutting-edge Virtual Reality technology. The Google Cardboard Virtual Reality experience will live in the official Star Wars app and is available on both iOS and Android devices.You can snag one of the themed Cardboards in a Verizon store on December 2nd  exclusively. There are four different ones, and Im sure that theyll become collectible. As does anything physical having to do with Star Wars. Nice score by Verizon. The content will be available on the Star Wars official app for iOS and Android.The group behind the content itself, Industrial Light & Magics ILMxLAB, has been cranking away on creating immersive content for at least six months, so its gotta be good.While you wait, Star-Wars-Up your Google apps.
