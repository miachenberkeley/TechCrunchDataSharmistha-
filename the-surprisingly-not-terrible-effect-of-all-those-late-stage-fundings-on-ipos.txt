Youve seen the headlines; you know that over the last couple of years,a growing number of startupshas gonepublic at valuations belowwhere they werevaluedas privately held companies (or sunkpast them quickly).Youve also come to understand that a lot of late, and often lofty, private company valuations are gettingset by investors who receive preferred shares in exchange for their checks. What that means: those investors receive downside protection in the form of rights to get paid ahead of other investorsortoget paid back more than other investorsin case the companies value declines.Theres a silver lining, though. According to new research out of the law firm Fenwick & West, which has been actively tracking financing terms,of the 41 U.S.-based technology companies that went public eitherlast year or 2014and that had raisedventure fundingin the prior three years (life sciences companies were not included), just 20 percent  thats eight companies  saw these so-called ratchets triggered.One of those companies was the payment services company Square, which EquityZen cofounder Shriram Bhashyam wrote about here at TechCrunch last November. Its a veryuseful example of how this stuff works.As Bhashyam noted then, the companys Series E investors paid $15.46 per share for Series E Preferred Stock. The ratchet in Squares Series E provided that if the IPO price wasless than $18.56 per share, the IPO conversion formulawould adjustsuch that the Series E investors would receive a number of common shares equivalent to a number if the IPO price had been $18.56.Put another way,Squares Series E investors were guaranteed a 20 percent return on Squares IPO. Because Square priced at roughly $13 when it went public in November (its now trading at $9.23), those Series E investors were provided with millions more shares of common stock to guarantee their return.That doesnt sound so great. But Fenwick & West is saying thats not generally happening as much as you might guess.More,according to its research, while the additional equity given out to shareholders on account of these IPO protections grew noticeably, it says, from 2014 to 2015 the effect on the companys other shareholders wasnt huge, averaging just 3 percent of the companys pre-IPO equity.Indeed, it seems that even the private markets got ahead of the public markets on valuations in some cases, and even though inmanyof these deals the investors had protections against them sustaining a loss in an IPO, the effect of the protection wasnta big problem for the company.Of course,41 companies isnt much of a study sample.And as you may also be aware, thereve been no IPOs on U.S. exchanges this month, so well see what happens with the many richly funded companies waiting in the wings.Evenattorney Barry Kramer, who co-authored this latest reportand notes to us that things haveworked out pretty reasonably for all concerned over the last couple of years, adds, a beatlater, At least, so far.You can check out the entirety of Fenwicks survey datahere.
