There are more Kickstarter watches out there these days than grains of sand on the beach. Everyone with a quartz movement and a NATO strap figures they can make and sell some kind of fashion watch to the masses, a concept that is as silly as it is flawed. Thats why the Tactico Geomaster GMT is actually interesting. First, it uses a mechanical ETA movement  an rare movement these days given their scarcity  and the design is at once familiar and unique. In short, its what I wish more watchmakers were doing in crowdfunding circles.The Geomaster is a GMT watch. This means it can display the time in multiple time zones  depending on how to read the bezel. Its great for travelers and pilots. It also features Superluminova hands, coat steel case, and a custom date dial. In short, its very unique and very clever. It was created by Compaa Relojera Especializada para Actividades Subacuticas aka CREPAS, a custom diver manufacturer in Zaragoza, Spain.At about $900 youre paying an awful lot for a GMT watch but based on the quality and design as well as the movement, its not that much. The GMT hand is actually a dial under the face, which is far more interesting than I originally imagined.That said if youre into mechanicals and want something that decidedly cant send winking smiley face emojis to your friends, this might be a nice starter watch.
