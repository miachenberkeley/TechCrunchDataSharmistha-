The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is disrupting New Orleans tonight, which means there is no better time for you to register for tickets than right now.What is a TC Meetup + Pitch-off, you ask? Excellent question!More than a handful of ore-selected companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their product to a panel of esteemed judges. Those judges will hold a quick Q&A after every pitch to tie up any loose ends, and will eventually determine a winner.First place gets one table in Startup Alley at the upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt conference. Second place receives two tickets to the show, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket.The whole thing is going down in conjunction with Nola Tech Week, so you can expect to see some big names from the New Orleans tech scene hanging out during the competition.And afterwards, we drink! (21+ only, please.)Register now!Doors open at 6:30pm tonight. Be there!
