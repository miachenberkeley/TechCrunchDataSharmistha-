Were so close! The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is in three days and time is running out to buy tickets. What is the TC Pitch-off, you ask? Ten pre-selected companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their products to a panel of expert judges. Judges include Greycrofts Alan Patricof, Foursquares J Crowley, FirstMarks Amish Jani, Quires Erin Glenn, and TC East Coast Editor John Biggs. Each pitch concludes with a brief Q&A session and at the end of presentations, judges will determine a winner. First place will receive a table in the Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. Second place gets two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner will take home one ticket to the big show. The event starts at 6pm on Tuesday, August 18 and will be held at Le Poisson Rouge in downtown Manhattan. Tickets cost $25 (this is a 21+ event) and can be purchased right here.
