New Orleans, prepare yourselves.TechCrunch is coming at you with the world-renowned TC Meetup + Pitch-off and its going down way sooner than you might suspect (mostly because Disrupt disrupted my life).For those of you who havent yet heard, the TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is essentially a smaller version of the TC Disrupt Battlefield competition. Ten pre-selected startups will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their wares to the audience and a panel of expert judges, who will conduct a quick Q&A concluding each pitch and eventually determine a winner.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at the next TC Disrupt conference. Second place receives two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket to the show.Afterwards, we all hang out, throw back a few cold ones, and shoot the breeze (and by shoot the breeze, I mean talk tech).Were holding our New Orleans meetup in conjunction with NOLA Tech Week, which means the event will be located at Peoples Heath New Orleans Jazz Market, with doors opening at 6:30pm on October 8.If you want to apply to participate in the pitch-off, head over here and dont tarry. As I said before, were short on time.Tickets to the TC Meetup + Pitch-Off can be found right here.
