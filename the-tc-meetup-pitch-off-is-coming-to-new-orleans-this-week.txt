TechCrunch is headed back to New Orleans, just in time for Nola Tech Week.In true TC fashion, well be bringing the TC Meetup + Pitch-off with us, where ten companies will have the opportunity to pitch their wares to a live audience and a panel of local VC judges.These startups, which will be announced shortly, will have exactly sixty seconds on stage to pitch their product, after which the judges panel will conduct a quick Q&A. Once all the pitches have concluded, judges will determine a winner.First place gets a table in Startup Alley at the next TC Disrupt. Second place gets two tickets to the show, and the Audience Choice winner will take home one ticket to the conference.But its not all about the battle. Well also have a chance to hang out, get to know one another, and throw back a few cold ones (that said, 21+ only please).Were holding our New Orleans meetup in conjunction with NOLA Tech Week, which means the event will be located at Peoples Heath New Orleans Jazz Market, with doors opening at 6:30pm on October 8.If you want to register for the Nola Meetup + Pitch-off, you can buy tickets here.
