Were a day away, people.The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off in NYC is going down in almost exactly 24 hours, and it simply wouldnt be complete without you.Ten companies will have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their products to a panel of expert judges, including Foursquare product manager J Crowley and Greycroft partner Alan Patricof, among others.At the end of each pitch, the judges will conduct a quick Q&A session and, when all presentations are completed, determine a winner.First place receives a table in the Startup Alley at TC Disrupt SF in September. Second place will get two tickets to the big show, and the Audience Choice winner will receive one ticket to the conference.As an added bonus, New York City CTO Minerva Tantoco will be joining us to give some opening remarks about the state of the NYC tech scene.After the Pitch-Off, there will be plenty of time for networking, poaching recruiting, and general merriment. Plus, there will be booze (21+ only, please).The fun begins at 6pm at Le Poisson Rouge on Bleecker St.Today and tomorrow are your last chances to get tickets and join in the fun, so dont wait around.Buy tickets for the Meetup here.
