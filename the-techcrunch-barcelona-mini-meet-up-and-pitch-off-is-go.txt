Since I posted about a potential Mini Meet-Up in Barcelona Ive gotten quite a few emails and requests to attend. To that end, Ive decided to open Pitch-Off applications and RSVPs for a few days to get a rough number of how many people will attend. I dont know if well charge at the door or have to charge a nominal fee  5 Euro or so  via EventBrite but this will at least give me an idea of what will be happening.We expect to hold the event on March 3 from about 8pm until 11pm. We have some folks looking for space right now so well update you as we find a location.Everyone, not just MWC attendees, are invited and well have a pitch-off at 9pm.Pitch-Off Competition
