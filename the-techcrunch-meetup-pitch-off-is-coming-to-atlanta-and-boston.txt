Its that time of the year again. After a restful holiday season, filled with Disrupt Europe and CES, were ready to hit the road again and visit some of our favorite cities.The first TC Meetups of the year will go down in Boston and Atlanta, on February 23 and February 25 respectively. Weve visited both cities for the past few years, and have never been let down by the tech sprouting up in these markets. This year should be no different.But in case youre new to the game, let me fill you in on what exactly a TC Meetup is.The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is an event we hold in different markets where we have the chance to hang out with the local tech scene. But beyond basic networking, we also hold a pitch-off, where ten startups will have exactly one minute to pitch their product to a panel of local VC judges.At the end, we crown our winners, with first place getting a booth in Startup Alley at the upcoming TC Disrupt and two tickets to the conference. Second place gets two tickets to the big show, and the Audience Choice winner gets one ticket.To participate in the pitch-off, startups must apply right here.If you simply want to attend the event, you can purchase tickets right here for Atlanta and right here for Boston.Cant wait to see you!Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
