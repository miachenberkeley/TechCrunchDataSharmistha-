The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off in NYC is kicking off in less than two weeks, and you know better than most that a party isnt really a party unless youre there.But lets not get ahead of ourselves.The TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-off is a very special event, one I favor over most everything else we do at TC, where folks from the local tech scene can come together and enjoy each other.As a cherry on top, we select 10companies to participate in the 60-second pitch-off, in which each company will be given exactly one minute to pitch their wares to a panel of expert judges and, of course, the audience.After each pitch, judges will hold a brief Q&A session and after all of the pitches have concluded, will deliberate and choose a winner.First place will receive a table in the Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. Second place gets two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner will take home one ticket to the big show.Judges include Greycrofts Alan Patricof, Foursquares J Crowley, FirstMarks Amish Jani, Quires Erin Glenn, and TC East Coast Editor John Biggs.It will be a night to remember, unless you have too much to drink. (Thats my way of saying this is a 21+ event.)All will go down on Tuesday, August 18 at Le Poisson Rouge. Tickets ($25) can be purchased right here.See you there, hot stuff!Sponsors make TechCrunch events possible.
