CNN is reporting that Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old boy who was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school, has switched schools. He is leaving MacArthur High School and he and his parents are choosing another school where, we assume, he wont be arrested for curiosity.Ahmed gained Internet fame two days ago when school officials called the police when he brought a homemade clock to school. Officials thought the clock, encased in a handsome metal case, looked like a bomb. Ahmed said he was interrogated at school by police.They told me No, you cant call your parents,' Ahmed said. Youre in the middle of an interrogation at the moment. They asked me a couple of times, Is it a bomb? and I answered a couple of times, Its a clock.'I felt like I was a criminal, the teenager said. I felt like I was a terrorist. I felt like all the names I was called.Ahmed said he was scared at first but now he is happy. In fact, President Obama invited him to the White House and multiple colleges and Valley notables  including Mark Zuckerberg  have offered their support. Its unclear what hes building next, but I cant imagine hell have trouble finding cool parts.Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great. President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015Hi @IStandWithAhmed, we  building things at @twitter too.
