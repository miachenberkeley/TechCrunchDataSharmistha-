Launching today, theTrackRBravo is a Bluetooth-powered device that keeps track of things youd hate to lose.A bit taller and thicker than a quarter, the new $29 aluminum TrackR is meant to be stuck on your keys, in yourwallet or on your dogs collar so you can track it via map in a corresponding iOS and Android app. The Bravo also comes with adhesive stickers, so you can even attach it to things like the remote that always gets stuck under the couch or between the cushions.Once youve got it on your object of choice, the app lets you choose from a list of preset optiond for what it could be, then registers the object in TrackRs Crowd GPS database. Crowd GPS is TrackRs solution for getting around the fact that its essentially impossible to cram a GPS into a device this size and get the months of battery you can squeeze out of Bluetooth LE.Instead of spending more power to deal with the rare occasion that you lose your Bravo after your phone dies, TrackR has made it so that other phones running its app can see devices from the Crowd GPS list and ping you with the latest location.Its a clever solution, but requires the company to pick up a lot more traction before you can feel confident that your device will be discovered.I personally found the TrackR most useful right inside my apartment, which is currently in a state of organized chaos. Everything looks like a mess, but its all in the right place. The problem with this mode of organization is that eventually you forget which bin holds that backup pair of headphones. With the TrackR stuck to them, I could simply swipe over to the headphone item, give it a tap, and hear the Bravo give out a sharp alert. In the case that you misplace your phone but not your keys, you can also press the Bravo to set off an alert from your iPhone.The range you can get on the TrackR Bravo is about what youd expect from a device relying on Bluetooth LE. Depending on what structures are between your phone and the radio, you can expect to maintain communication between devices from 25 to 40 feet away.The TrackR Bravo isnt alone in the Bluetooth tracker space, with options like Tile offering similar functionality in the same general price range. If youre one for aesthetics, I give points to the Bravo for its clean aluminum look, though it can get beat up when attached to keys.Most tracker manufacturers give deep discounts when ordering several (and youre probably going to need to register several devices before thinking to check it is second-nature), so if the idea appeals to you its best to jump in by getting enough to track most of your smaller valuables.
