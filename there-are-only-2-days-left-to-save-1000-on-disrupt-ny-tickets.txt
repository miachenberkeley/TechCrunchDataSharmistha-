The clock is counting down to Disrupt New York (May 4  May 6, if were getting specific) and that means early bird pricing for tickets is about to expire. The window closes on Friday and once it does, prices will go up by $1,000 so consider this fair warning. Get out ahead of this. Disrupt New York is set to be TechCrunchs best conference yet, with a speakers list that includes Limor Fried, Eric Hippeau, Payal Kadakia, Bastian Lehmann, Aaron Levie, Bill Maris, Dave McClure, and thats just the start of it. And thats just the morning sessions. Each afternoon, the hottest new companies in tech will take the stage with their best product pitch in the Startup Battlefield. A panel of incredible judges (which usually includes the likes of Fred Wilson, Ron Conway, Marissa Mayer and more) will take a hard look each Battlefield company before determining the winner of the Disrupt NY Battlefield. The winner takes home $50,000 and the Disrupt cup, with past participants including companies like Postmates, Yammer, and Dropbox.
