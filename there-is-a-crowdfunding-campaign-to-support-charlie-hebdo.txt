Update: ThePress and Pluralism Fund, which was set up by French newspapersto ensure diversity in media publishing (Ill let that sink in),has set up a campaign for Charlie Hebdo support. Its address is here.Theres alsoa crowdfunding campaign to support the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and the families of victims of the killing spree at itsheadquarters.The campaign was started by David Opolon, an MIT PhD and a principal with a large consulting firm here in the U.S.Its great that a lot of people all over the world are donating. Whats more important than just the amount is that we maximize the number of people that contribute, Opolon says.For its good intentions, the logistics of how the money will be distributed hasnt been worked out, Opolon says.Thats something we need to define as we get in touch with Charlie Hebdo, who are rightly mourning and working on the next issue, he told me. The intent is for [the money]to go both to the families of the victims and to ensure the continuity of the paper.
