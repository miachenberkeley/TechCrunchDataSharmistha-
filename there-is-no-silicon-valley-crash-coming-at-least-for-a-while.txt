When valuations are increasing exponentially, excitement is building to a fever pitch, and companies are sprouting seemingly overnight  its almost like everyone becomes afraid that success wont last.The headlines are beginning to appear already, like the July 23rd article inTechCrunch, heralding the imminent doom and gloom that would come from thetech bubble burst: Should it burst, the tech bubble will have ramifications that ripple around the tech world like the shockwave from an apocalyptic asteroid. Most tech hubs are not self-sufficientat all; the fact that they are always referred to as the Silicon Valley of [insert country] should be a tipoff that they are merely branches off the trunk that is Silicon Valley. Even prolific hubs like Israel, China and India depend on Silicon Valley to pump capital through their arteries.Additionally, the media points to the emergence of unicorns those companies valued at more than $1 billion, like Slack  and now the decacorns, which are those valued at more than $10 billion, like Uber (which has been given the illustrious valuation of $50 billion).CB Insights notes that there are currently 107 of these unicorns whose fanciful rainbows may begin to blind investors, and the Valley, to the overall reality that companies cannot all reach those levels of value.At the same time that these self-proclaimed soothsayers are issuing warnings, there is the other side of the coin, where the apocalypse may actually have to wait a bit longer.Unlike the housing market and the previous Silicon Valley burst that started the 21stcentury, the sky is not falling here and Chicken Little should be put on mute at this stage in the tech startup game. Lessons have been learned from the past, and todays investors and entrepreneurs do not plan on repeating history.Its that thought process, and the now in-depth analysis of the data that can be done, that makes what is happening now different from a bubble. The New York Timesrecently reminded us about what a bubble means: A bubble, in the economic sense, is basically a period of excessive speculation in something, whether it is tulips, tech companies or houses.That doesnt stop people from talking and some VCs to back off a bit.Despite sources likeSilicon Valley Newsreporting that the second quarter of 2015 was the largest quarter in Silicon Valley since 2000, investors assure everyone that no one is speculating, but rather investing in those high-demand segments and verticals that are showing significant sustainable revenue and viable metrics.Lets dig into some numbers to further show why the media cant burst our bubble here in the Valley, which show positive signs when looking at IPOs and the number of unicorns on the cusp of going public.Arecently released report from Ernst & Young(EY) about the health of the global IPO market hassignificant numbers to back up this positive forecast that goes beyond just whats happening in the Valley. Here are the highlights:In focusing on theU.S. IPOsspecifically, more numbers emerge that show the sky is still there, despite some decrease in IPOs:However, this is not a bad sign. EY reports that U.S. IPO activity is expected to rise through the rest of 2015 with a robust pipeline, strong investor confidence and improving economic fundamentals. The proof is in the fact that EY found that IPO returns continued to outperform the S&P 500 Index during the first half of 2015, while market volatility declined.Also, although the NASDAQ Composite reached levels similar to the dot-com bubble 15 years ago, valuations of leading public technology companies have tended to be more realistic than the same time period. Additionally,the JOBS Act was mentioned as having a positive influence in terms of driving IPOs.Something else you need to figure is with all these recent companies going public, there are still thousands of employees with stock options that are not fully vested. Some of these employees still have two years until all their millions of dollars worth of stock vests. Most of these people will re-invest in their own startups, houses or in startups in their local areas.Whilesome startupswill not go public as quickly as expected, and appear to belengthening the transaction process, this is not necessarily a bad sign. Instead, more companies are taking a measured approach, planning out their public offerings two years in advance.This further builds out the global IPO pipeline and puts vesting schedules even further out in the timeline for employees, providing a way for more of these startups to shore up their cash reserves and solidify their positions as a developed business.Also, the diversion of funds to fuel unicorns is draining funds that typically have supported IPOs that have been used to scale their business. In this way, the market factors have changed compared to other periods when the bubble burst, making it like comparing apples to oranges.As EY reports, this could lead to anew type of IPOthat actually creates companies that are bigger, more stable, and with more established business models that deliver the sequential quarterly growth public market investors expect and reward.In this way, the IPO is not about scaling up but about focusing on other benefits, including greater transparency, stronger reputation and brand profile, and the potential to access new markets via cross-border listings.Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, one of the Valleys most powerful VCs, put it this way in an interview: In 2000, you had 50million people on the Internet, and the number of smartphones was zero. Today, you have three billion Internet users and two billion smartphones. Its Pong versus Nintendo. Its Carlota Perezs argument that technology is adopted on an S curve: the installation phase, the crash  because the technology isnt ready yet  and then the deployment phase, when technology gets adopted by everyone and the real money gets made.While all good things must eventually come to an end, the measured approach that more founders and investors are taking in terms of disrupting and innovation means the end wont come with a crash, burn, burst or any other destructive event. If anything, it will be a slowdown and recalibration for the next opportunity that comes during a new cycle.The sky is not falling. Instead, lets continue to focus on building sustainable companies with well-conceived strategies and high levels of execution.
