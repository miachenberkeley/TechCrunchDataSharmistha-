Were about a week out from Mobile World Congress, the big trade show where just about everyone-but-Apple traditionally shows off their new flagship phones for the next year.Many of the leaks come by way of Evan Blass, or, as hes perhaps better known, evleaks.His first photo dump came on Saturday, showing off what seems to be the S7 Edge (complete with the Edge series signature wrap around screen) in silver, black and gold:Eye candy. pic.twitter.com/sIJXMx9o8G Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 13, 2016Later that evening, he followed up with shots of the non-Edge S7, with its more standard display:Eye candy, pt. 2. pic.twitter.com/UM6rWM6oTj Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 14, 2016And now, by way of a user on Weibo, we have what looks to be a glimpse (albeit a rather blurry one) at an actual, booting S7 Edge:If youre saying Hey, that looks just like the existing S6, youre not wrong  on its face, the S6 and S7 seem to look pretty darn similar.If rumors are to be believed, though, the S7 should bring plenty of new stuff under the hood: a 3D Touch-esque pressure sensitive screen, a USB C port, and the rumored return of the sorely missed microSD slot (which Samsung dropped in the S6/S6 Edge to the dismay of many)
