(Self plug: The Doctors TARDIS)And now: the Shishkebab, the insane, fire-engulfed sword from Fallout.Built by Caleb Kraft of Make with the help of artist Platinumfungi, this real life version is about as close to its digital original as possible. I mean, look at this (top is the real life build; bottom is the concept art from the game):They start with a katana, then strap on everything from a butane canister to a brake lever stripped off an old motorcycle. And before you think about going and doing this yourself, a heads up: the fact that Caleb also built a Ukelele-sized version of the Mad Max flame guitar helped a lot in the whole not-blowing-himself-up department.The demo video is embedded above, but Caleb also has a day-by-day build diary over at Make  if, like me, you think the process is half the fun, Id recommend it.Will it help you survive the nuclear apocalypse?
