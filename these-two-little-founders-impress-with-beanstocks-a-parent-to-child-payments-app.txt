Two of theyoungestco-founders to take the stage at TechCrunch Disrupts Hackathon on Sunday wereKieran Mann, 9, andRohan Chopra, 10. The duo impressedthe crowd as they delivered a killer pitch for their app, Beanstocks, an app that allows parents to coordinate allowances and payments for their kids that are attached to real bank accounts.Beanstockshas versionsfor both parents and children, allowing mom or dad to set recurring payments for kids chores like cleaning their room and send cash easily.Piggy banks are so last century, exclaimed Mann as hepitched onstage. What the foundershave in mind is a situation where kids are engaging with real life banking practices from an early age. Younger users can use the app to keep track of their cash and manage how theyre spending money.Chopra told me that connecting a bank account also takes away lame excuses from parents who may not have cash on them to pay fordoing the weekly chores, all they have to do is tap on a toggle in Beanstocks and whatever quantity of cash they have in mind is transferred to the childs bank account.Mann and Chopra are both buddies at school who love building stuff. The pairsaid this is thefirst Hackathon theyve participated in, but I wouldnt have guessed it judging by how at-ease they appeared. They both gave me a quick walkthrough of the apps different workflows and were both chatting with each other about improvements that they could add in even as they were delivering a pretty convincing pitch.Mann and Chopra arent done with Beanstocks and seemed excited forall of the potential features they were hoping to add, so keep an eye out for whats next from these two.
