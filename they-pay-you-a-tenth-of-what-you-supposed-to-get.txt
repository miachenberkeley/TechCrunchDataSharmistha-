Theyve got the money, but hes got the microphone. This weekend, Jay Z threw some punches at the big tech companies who compete with his upstart music streaming service Tidal. The freestyle came as part of Jay Zs B-Sides concert, a performanceof some of his rarest songs that was supposed to exclusively be available for live stream on Tidal.Naturally, videos of the show immediately ended up on YouTube.Tidal touts exclusives from its all-star lineup of partnered artists like Kanye West, Daft Punk, Beyonce, Arcade Fire, and Madonna. The problem is that fans dont take kindly to pay walls, and inconvenience encourages piracy.For more on why Tidal sounds doomed, check out my rant video:But something special did come out of Jay Zsshow. He ripped on Google as well as Jimmy Iovine, head of Apples Beats Music, for apparently trying to buy him out. He roasts YouTube for what he considers tiny payouts to artists.Then Jay Z, also referring to himself as Jigga and Hova, addressed criticism that Tidals partnered artists are rich, so why should fans care about making sure theyre paid? He admits his Tidalers own shit but asks why people dont have a problem paying Apple for iPhones or Phil Knights Nike for shoes. Plus Spotify is valued at $9 billion so theyre not exactly starving artists themselves.Dont ever go with the flow. Be the flow.I dont need no middlemen to talk to my n*ggas /I understand if you dont understand I figure Im Jigga / Thats where we differ / I take whats mine you accept what they give you, I get you / I dont take no checks, I take my respect / Pharrell even told me Go with the best bet / Jimmy Iovine offered a safety net / Google dangle round a crazy check / I feel like YouTube is the biggest culprit / Them n*ggas pay you a tenth of what you supposed to getYou know n*ggas died for equal pay, right? / You know when I work I aint your slave, right? / You know Iaint shucking and jivin and high fivin / You know this aint back in the days, right? / But I cant tell by the way they kill Freddie Gray right / Shot down Mike Brown like the way they did Tray, right? Let em continue choking n*ggas / we gon turn style / I aint your token n*gga /You know I came in this game independent, right? / Tidal / My own label / same difference / Oh n*ggas is skeptical cause they own shit / You bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich / Phil Knights worth trillions, you still bought those kicks / Spotifys nine billion and they aint say shit / Lucyyy you got some splainin to do / The only one they hatin on look the same as you / Thats cool / I know they tryin to bamboozle you / Spending millions on media tryin to confuse you / I had to talk to myself Hov, you used to it / Its politics as usual.But for all of Jays witty rhymes, Tidals problems remain. Its starting way behind in the music streaming race, it has no free ad-supported tier to pull in users to pay $10 a month, few will pay $20 for HD sound, and its top exclusives get pirated. At least Tidal is raising the question about how artists can be fairly compensated, even if it doesnt have the answer.
