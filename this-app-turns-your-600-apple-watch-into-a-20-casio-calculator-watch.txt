Plenty of people have compared the Apple Watch to the classic Casio calculator watch; these guys went ahead and made the inevitable app.Meet GeekWatch  the app that turns your Apple Watch into an old-school calculator watch.I mean, sure  you could buy a calculator watch on Amazon for like 15 bucks. But wheres the meta/hipster/ironic/kinda-obnoxious humor in that?They swap out the Casio brand for Geekio for obvious (read: legal) reasons, but the inspiration is clear.One catch: since Apple hasnt enabled custom watch faces yet, its not able to take over the entire screen, and youll still have some borders/margins/text around the edges.Alas, it costs a $1. On the upside, there are myriad goodies to unlock if you poke it in the right way. Remember trying to spell words upside down to pass the time in class as a kid? Thats a good place to start.Alternatively, check out the tizi Calc app; the Casio-style homage isnt as direct (and also costs a buck as an in-app purchase, though the app itself is free), but its got that same geek-stalgia vibe going for it.[via producthunt]
