Damn. We see a lot of really cool DIY projects pass through these parts, but this one is probably the coolest Ive seen in a long while.The Apple Watch is coming out in a few days. You knew that  you read TechCrunch/have the Internet/dont live under a rock/etc.Looking to wrap something a bit more unique around his wrist, Instructables user Aleator777 put together a watch of his own based on one of Apples older releases: the pinnacle of 1977 personal computing, the Apple II.Meet the Apple II Watch.Taking roughly a month to build, this project has just about everything a good, geeky DIY project should: 3D printing! Impressive engineering! Custom programmed microcontrollers! Mounds upon mounds of clever execution!Packed inside that 3D-printed shell (with its perfect shade of sun-faded beige) is a Teensy microcontroller, a 1.8 LCD screen, a rechargeable battery, and a tiny 2W speaker for emitting myriad bleeps and bloops. It even has an itty-bitty floppy drive with equally itty-bitty floppies, though theyre all for looks.Oh, and because no Apple Watch is complete without that digital crown, its got a rotary knob for navigation/input.Perhaps most impressive, Aleator777 isnt keeping his process under wraps to make sure this thing stays one-of-a-kind. Quite the contrary: he has released a step-by-step guide, along with all of the files and software required to build your own.Seriously, Aleator777  great job.
