My favorite DIY projects are ones that an idiot like myself can do in a few days. To wit, this Raspberry Pi laptop that lets you create a portable computer with keyboard and mouse with only a few parts.The project uses the PiJuice battery module and a 5-inch TFT module. In this project you simply cut or print a case for the screen  this one uses laser cut wood  and an HDMI cable.Slap in an HDMI cable, a wireless keyboard and mouse and youre all set. Arguably this thing is far less complex than, say, the Pi-Top 3D-printed laptop but it could be a fun side project. You can also use a standard battery to power the whole thing and you can buy a tiny keyboard and touchpad combo to make things a bit smaller. While you probably wont be doing much GIMP or 3D modeling on this little monster, you can definitely look like a true hax0r.
