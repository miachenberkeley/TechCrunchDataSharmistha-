As weve discussed, Facebooks bot platform is still in its early stages, and most apps arent ready yet to become part of your everyday life. This is mainly due to shortfalls in natural language processing and the trial-and-error process of developers actually figuring out how users are going to use bots.But one company, the slightly inappropriatelynamed And Chill, has figured out how to builda bot thatis actually well suited for Facebooks chat-based interface.And Chill is a movie recommendationengine that is eschewing the traditional like/dislike model of recommendation, instead pledging to dig deeper into the reasons a viewer would want to watch a certain movie.Heres how it works:The bot can be accessed via Facebook Messenger or SMS. After the superfluouspleasantries standard with all bots these days, And Chill asks you to tell it a movie you liked and why.For example, Id say I liked Concussion because it was a true storyabout sports that also seemed like a medical mystery film.And Chill then analyzes these components and uses them to recommend similar films. The startupisnt ready to give specific examples on how exactly its algorithm works, besides that it uses a few different frameworks to detect patterns, attributes,and other factors to pull movie options for viewers.While I was at first skeptical of the startups lack of transparency around the recommendation process (mainly just because I like knowing how things work) most of that disappeared once I actually received some valuable suggestions.All three (decently complicated) questions I posed were answered with movies that I either had already seen and loved, or more frequently hadnt heard of but looked great. Since I usually tend to watch most movies that are similar to ones I like (i.e all Wes Anderson films) I suspect the algorithm specifically tries to recommend films you are likely to not have seen yet.Currently, requests take a few minutes to process (so dont give up if you havent heard back yet), which may be because the startup noted thatthat some requests involve human input to confirm what their data crunching gives them.Overall, the service is a huge leap forward fromthe traditional way of scrolling through a list of hundreds ofmovies at a time.That being said, there could still be some improvements that would enhancethe experience even more.For example, eachresponse currently includes a link to a YouTube trailer so you can quickly check out the preview. But it would alsobe nice to see a rotten tomato score and brief synopsis,so you dont gave to go searching for any additional information online.You can try And Chill by messaging them on Facebook here, or texting them at this number:213-297-3673
