Damn, this is more fun than I wouldve expected.Do you ever type things into Google just to see what whacky stuff pops up in the autocomplete box?GoogleFeud takes that concept and turns it into a Family Feud-style game. How well do you know the hivemind?GoogleFeud provides the first half of a search query, and you fill in the rest. Your goal is to guess as many of the most popular queries as you can.If it provides Should I sell my ., for example, you might guess house, car, or dog. If your guesses line up with one of the most popular queries as searched for by Google visitors, you get a point; if it doesnt, you get a strike. Three strikes, and the game is over. Want to see the answers to that board up above, for example? Here you go.One downside Ive noticed: the engine isnt very good at combining similar results, something that the real Family Feud accounts for behind-the-scenes. You also have to be absolutely specific in your answers  if you say plane and the answer was airplane, thats a strike.Quirks aside, its a damn fun way to kill a few minutes and see how well you can predict the wonderings of the masses.You start off by picking one of four categories: Culture, People, Names, and Questions. Id recommend starting with names, as it seems to be the least susceptible to the aforementioned shortcomings.Bonus tip: theres no built-in multiplayer option, but its still a pretty great game to play cooperatively with a friend. I spent the morning brainstorming guesses with my fiance  and while the game totally kicked our ass, we had a blast.You can find GoogleFeud right over here.Oh, and a bit of fun trivia: the game was built by Justin Hook, who helps to write Bobs Burgers and the 5-part Bobs Burgers comic series.[Via ProductHunt]
