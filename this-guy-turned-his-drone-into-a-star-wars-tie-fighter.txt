Remember that custom Millennium Falcon quadcopter from a few weeks back? It better look out. The Rebel Alliance isnt the only one with birds in the air anymore.As a followup to his Millennium Falcon project, French RC hobbyist Olivier_C has built a second quadcopter  but this time around, hes building for the Empire.Modeled after the TIE Interceptor from Return Of The Jedi, Olivier says this guy took about 15 hours to design and at least as many to get it flying right. In the end, at least 14 propellers were sacrificed for the cause  including a few that sent carbon shrapnel shooting into the walls of his garage.Can it make the Kessel Run in fewerthan 12 parsecs? Nah. But it probably can blow some minds at the local park.For comparison, the maiden flight of his Millennium Falcon:Want to see this thing come together step-by-step? Olivier has a full build gallery right over here.
