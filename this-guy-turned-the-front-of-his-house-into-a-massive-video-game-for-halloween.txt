Most kids love Halloween.Most kids also love video games.Put the two together, and youre going to be the king of your neighborhood (if only for a night).Thats exactly what Rich Fiore did, turning the side of his house into an interactive, Haunted House-themed shooter.The video is a bit short, but youll get the gist:So hows he doing it? Witchcraft, of course. Witchcraft and projectors, a camera for mapping and aligning the visuals, and a modified Wii-remote paired with IR emitters for placing the crosshairs.My favorite part: if you miss a ghost and instead shoot the wall of his house, it breaks away to reveal the Tyvek construction sheets underneath. Shoot at the windows, and they virtually shatter away. Helluva touch.
