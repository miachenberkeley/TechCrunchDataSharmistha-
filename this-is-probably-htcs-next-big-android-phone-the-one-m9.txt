Weve still got nearly a week to go before HTC officially unveils their new top-tier Android phone at Mobile World Congress, but it looks like the details have already started dumping out.On an episode of Droidcast back in January, we were pretty confident that HTCs next big device  which we tentatively called the HTC One M9  would look a whole lot like its HTCs last flagship, the One M8.Sure enough: if these latest leaks are legit, its pretty much a dead ringer. Theyve moved some buttons around, sure, and it looks like theyve gone from two cameras on the rear to one  but unless you really know your stuff, a quick glance would leave you thinking the two devices were one in the same.Check out these spy shots, obtained by the guys at Phandroid:Note that third button below the pair of volume buttons on the right. Thats the power button, which on the One M8 was located on the top of the device. Given how damned big the One M8 is, having the power button up top made it a bit arduous to reach at times.Meanwhile, Germanys MobileGeeks.de found some official-looking renders lurking on a German phone retailer site, though the page has since been gutted of most of its imagery.Fortunately, these shots got snagged before that happened:So, yeah it seemingly looks a lot like the M8. Heres a side-by-side of the back side:But, hell  pretty much all smartphones look alike these days. Its whats on the inside that counts, right?Heres what the rumor mill suggests is under the hood:Everything is still up in the air for now, of course. Even the name is still up for debate; some say its the One M9, some say its just The One. Whatever the case, HTC should be making things 100% official come March 1st in Barcelona.
