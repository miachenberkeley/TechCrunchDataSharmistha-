Editors note:ItayRosenfeldis the CEO of Voxbone and has more than 13 years of experience in the telecommunications industry.WebRTCis an open-source standard (spearheaded by Google in 2012 through the World WideWebConsortium) enabling browsers to make voice or video calls without needing any plug-ins. UsingWebRTC, a user can establish a voice or video call by clicking on a button in a browser representing the other endpoint.This other end could be a person, a conferencing platform, a customer support service, a video source, etc. This capability clearly has massive potential for altering how consumers communicate online  not just between themselves but also with companies that provide everyday services.Despite its promising future,WebRTCstill has a long way to go before it comes anywhere near replacing phone number-based dialing and systems. However, I believe the comingyearwilloffer majorWebRTCadoption in both the telecom augmentation space and thewebapp space. Below are some of the most significant trends that I have noticed and believe will continue to gaintraction.Live voice and video chat for customer support.UsingWebRTCto integrate a companys website traffic into agent-based contact center interactions is an obvious business case. Services likeAmazons MaydayandAMEXs Live Video Chathave proven thatWebRTCtechnology improves the interaction betweenwebapplication users and the contact center.And usingWebRTCfor customer support has other benefits. For example, at the start of a call, the support agent will know who you are and what page youre on, a tremendous efficiency gain that both consumers and enterprises will undoubtedly appreciate.Click-to-join a conference.Another key area is usingWebRTCto join virtual conference calls. Until today, video is primarily reserved for high-end conference rooms and for voice access to a conference  most attendees join with a phone number.Simple click to join audio integration withWebRTCcan provide advantages both in voice quality through HD and spatial audio, as well as reduced costs for conferencing service providersandfor users. Not to mention avoiding the common conference call blunders highlighted in theYouTube videothat went viral lastyear.Going global.WebRTCis opening the door for service providers to extend global offers to consumers and businesses with devices that are not connected to their own phone networks, or when users are using another network. For example,WebRTCwould allow your wireless carrier to extend a communications service (e.g. video, voice, SMS, etc.) to any device on any network in the world without the need for a dedicated app that must be compatible with the majority of smartphones (e.g. WhatsApp).For example, services like T-Mobiles recently announcedWi-Fi calling featurecould be accomplished very easily, technologically speaking, if it usedWebRTC(currently, it does not). This value was confirmed at CES thisyear, where AT&T was announced to bethe first U.S. carrierto supportWebRTC.New services, new businesses.Beyond traditional telecom, several new applications are emerging that use real-time interactions as part of awebapplication or even totally new business models. For example, a number of micro consulting/services sites have emerged (e.g.PopExpert)that bring together experts (in the case of PopExpert, life coaches) with their consumers into face-to-face online consultations.Another example is social apps usingWebRTCto enable voice or video interaction, such asNTTs SkyTalk. Many newWebRTCimplementations are being developed and will come to market in2015.Although all of these trends are exciting, it is critical to look at them from a business perspective to assess the potential for mass adoption in the comingyear. I believe the comingyearwill serve asWebRTCs transition from a novelty and a basis for free communications, to the basis for offering business-related or subscription-based solutions to consumers, specifically from conferencing providers or online expert consultation providers.However, two things need to happen beforeWebRTCcan successfully enable the above described use cases:1. Microsoft, Google and Apple need to end their strategic war games inWebRTCThey have been doing so since its launch, which is whyWebRTCwas only supported by a limited number of browsers (Chrome and Firefox) for most of its existence  not enough to reach critical mass. In addition, there were disputes around which video codec to use, which practically excluded the use of video withWebRTC.Toward the end of 2014, both Google and Microsoft took steps to remove the roadblocks that have prevented widespread adoption ofWebRTCto date. In the (hopefully near) future, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox will all supportWebRTCwith video moving forward, thus reaching critical mass. There is no news yet onWebRTCsupport in Safari.2. Quality of experience needs to improveAsWebRTCwill be used for paid services, providers will be expected to deliver a quality experience that equals or exceeds the experience of the telephone network that consumers are used to. Weve all experienced dropped or unintelligible Internet calls more than wed care to, but we often deal with it because its not paid for.While the convenience of WebRTCor the availability of HD audio and video may be a draw, drop-outs, echoes or other user-experience issues may limit its use and value, which is why solutions are being developed in this area, as well.The combination of assured quality andWebRTCsupport for existing codecs and all major browsers (except Safari), may just make2015the yearthatWebRTCreally takes off. But as you can see, weve got a lot of work to do before we get there.
