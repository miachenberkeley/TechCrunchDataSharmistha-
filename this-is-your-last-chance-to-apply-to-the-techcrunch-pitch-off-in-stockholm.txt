In three short weeks, the TechCrunch team will be in the beautiful city of Stockholm for a good old TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off  and I couldnt be more excited about this event. If youre an entrepreneur and youre available on June 7, its now time to apply to the pitch-off.As the name suggest, the TechCrunch Meetup + Pitch-Off is a double feature. Were all getting together to have a drink, meet interesting people, talk about the startup ecosystem and the meaning of life. And were coming to Stockholm for the first time ever.During the pitch-off competition, eight to ten startups will have exactly two minutes to pitch their product to a panel of local VC judges and TechCrunch editors. At the end of the night, well crown the winner of the Stockholm Pitch-Off.But a competition without prizes is no fun, right? The winner will get a booth in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt in London. Second and third places will respectively get two tickets and one ticket for the big show.Do you think youve got what it takes? Then go ahead and apply right here right now. Applications close on May 23.If you want to attend the event, you can still buy a ticket.Date: June 7
