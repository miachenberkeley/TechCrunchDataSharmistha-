While I am not a huge fan of anime  I stopped at Akira and never picked it back up  I can appreciate attention to detail and true proplica badassery when I see it. And so we present the Dominator from Psycho-Pass, a quick-converting replica gun that moves from paralyzer to eliminator mode. It also connects to your smartphone for some added fun including the analysis of your targets Crime Coefficient score.The the gun, which has been floating around the fan boards for a while, will ship in March and will cost about $680 Japan. From the marketing materials:This product has been created under the supervision of Production I.G director Naoyoshi Shiotani and Nitroplus designer Makoto Ishiwata. DOMINATOR features characteristics identical to the devices seen in PSYCHO-PASS such as automatic transformation, voiceover and sound effects, authentic LED lighting, touch sensor activation, Crime Coefficient analysis and more.When DOMINATOR is aimed at a target, it will automatically analyze and readout the targets Crime Coefficient score. Connecting a smartphone will allow DOMINATOR to capture and stream an image from its built-in camera to the companion smartphone app and overlay Crime Coefficient data on the target image.
The gun has built-in sound features including voice-overs from Noriko Hidaka, the voice of the gun in the anime. Once again I dont know my Psycho-Pass from my Sailor Moon but darned if this isnt a cool replica gun.
