I could lie and tell you that we recorded a special July 4th edition of the TC Gadgets Podcast, but it wouldnt be accurate. In reality, we recorded this podcast over a week ago and I accidentally forgot to push the publish button. But the content still exists, so I felt strongly about sharing it with you guys. In this episode, we talk about the freshly released Amazon Echo, which is a connected speaker that listens to you, answers questions, and takes commands. And beyond that, Amazon recently opened up developer tools so that apps and services can integrate with the device. Its a pretty sick little toy, and has the potential to be the main hub for computing in the home. This weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast is brought to you by John Biggs, Jordan Crook, and Darrell Etherington.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.Click here to download an MP3 of this show.
