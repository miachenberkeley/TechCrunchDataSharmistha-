Hello friends and welcome back to another episode of Bullish, TechCrunchs first talk show. This week were taking a look at digital publications, the spate of recent shutdowns weve endured, and what they might mean.In the studio this week isSunil Rajaraman, who, with a partner, recently bought what is left of The Bold Italic, a beloved San Francisco publication that shut down earlier this year. (A small programming note: I mispronounced Sunils last name in the first half of the show. Please consider myself both embarrassed and apologetic.)As an aside, The Bold Italic is releasing its first piece of original content since its death and resurrection today. Look for it.Bullish airs every Wednesday morning at 7 am Pacific, and 10 am Eastern. Well see you all soon. In the meantime, pour a coffee and hit play.
