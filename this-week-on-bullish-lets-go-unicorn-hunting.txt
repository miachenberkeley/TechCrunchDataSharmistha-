Hello friends, and welcome to Bullish, TechCrunchs newest show. Were going to ship a new episode directly to your monitor each and every Wednesday morning, so make sure to setyour DVR browser to TechCrunch.com.This week, our very first, we focused on the concept of unicorns, a term that was born on these pages, and recently re-examined by Aileen Lee in an epic post that is far more than worth your time.Joining us to kick things off is Keith Krach, the current CEO of Docusign, a unicorn in its own right. The company has raised several hundred million dollars this year, and is currently valued north of $3 billion. Krach dropped by TechCrunch to talk about the massive expansion of companies valued north of $1 billion, and to agree that he is not, in fact, a teen.Hit play, shoot me a tweet with feedback, and, I hope, enjoy. The format of the show is new to your humble host, so if Im not perfect, know that Im working hard on reading from a screen while pretending not to.
