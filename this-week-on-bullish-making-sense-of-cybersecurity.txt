Hello friends, and welcome back to Bullish, TechCrunchs first talk show, and thing that I have run out of opening jokes for.This week we duginto an issue that is near to us all: Cyberbsecurity. As you might have heard from recent news coverage, even our Congress is working on the matter. You can handicap if that is something good, or not.Heres our ownCat Zakrzewski on a bill that passed the Senate today, and is widely expected to receive the signature of the President:In a crushing blow to the tech industry and privacy advocates, the Senate today passed the controversial Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA).The bill, which passed the Senate on a 74-21 bipartisan vote, is intended to allow companies to share information about cybersecurity threats with the government. However, critics, particularly those in the tech industry, say the bill will extend the surveillance capabilities of government intelligence agencies while doing little to prevent hacks.So, weve had better days. At the same time, one could argue that having any sort of action on the matter proves its importance, and preeminence. Perhaps.This week we had Craig Hinkley up to the studio to help us grok at once where we are at, and where we might go. Hinkley is the CEO of WhiteHat Security, a shop that does pretty much what its name says.As youll see in the clip, Hinkley is at once an optimist that things can be done better, but also not entirely enthused at our short-term prospects of shoring up our global cybersecurity. You can draw the balance yourself.Bullish airs every Wednesday morning at 7 am Pacific, and 10 am Eastern. Well see you all soon. In the meantime, pour a coffee and hit play.
