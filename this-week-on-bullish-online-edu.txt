Hello friends, and welcome to Bullish.This week we take a look atonline education, a large and diverse space that extends learning to those whomight find it inaccessible and locks in some students with high debt loads and limited career prospects.Online colleges have a difficult reputation, but that fact is not slowing innovation inside the larger digital education space. The rise of smartphones and growing Internet penetration mean that knowledge is now easy toaccess.To help us dive into the matter, wehad Ajay Kapur drop by TechCrunch to explain how he views the space. Kapur is the CEO and co-founder of Kadenze, an education startup that, for a low monthly fee, helps people take courses form their homes.The company has partnered with schools like Stanford and Princeton to provide content for its service. Kadenze has raised more than $1 million to date.While the education debate in the United States can often seem ridiculous, misguided, small-minded and generally sad, its nice to know that non-government entities are making strides toward bringing more information to more people.Bullish airs every Wednesday at 7 am Pacific, 10 am Eastern.
