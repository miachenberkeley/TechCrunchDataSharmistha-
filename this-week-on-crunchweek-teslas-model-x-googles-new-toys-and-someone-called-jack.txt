Hello friends, and welcome to another episode of CrunchWeek, TechCrunchs weekly roundup show that brings you the best of the past seven daysin just around 10minutes.This week myself, and the excellent Megan Rose Dickey and Drew Olanoff gathered to riff on Teslas new Model X, Googles recent hardware introductions including the new Chromecast, and, of course, whats up with Jack.As a minor aside, the Twitter drama has become slightlysurreal. Investors are impatient, the board is under heavy fire, and the hoi polloi are curious if Twitters product is something that can be turned around in short order. The irony is that Twitters product, at least among its core users, is something held on a pedestal; at issue is how to grow that group while not estranging the folks who create the massive influx of content that Twitters business is predicated on.Where do you draw the line between dilution and orthodoxy?I believe that we managed to make it through the episode without making a single Silicon Valley joke, which is to our credit given the Model Xs door structure. We will see you all in a week. In the meantime, stay cool.
