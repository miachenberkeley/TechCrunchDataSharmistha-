Hello dear friends, and welcome back to another episode of TCBTC, TechCrunchs bitcoin podcast. Akin to the proverbial ancient turtle, we are still here.This time around, John Biggs came back from Poland, and I sat in a conference room in San Francisco to avoid direct sunlight. On the docket is a recent TechCrunch article on the evolution and maturation of bitcoin itself, a short note on some positive trend data, and, of course, what those crazy kids over at Overstock are up to now.We ran a little over this week, but will compensate by trying to do a video show next week. Until then, stay cool my friends, like a well-maintained mining rig.Download MP3Subscribe on iTunes.You can subscribe to the show here.
