One important note about this podcast: Matt cant seem to get his microphones to work. Ever. So if youre wondering why we all sound like professional radio hosts (two of us are, actually) and Matt sounds like hot garbage, its because he is incompetent with microphones. Moving on!Pebble is against the ropes, according to a new story from John Biggs, with the Apple Watch taking smart watch center stage since its launch. Meanwhile, Matt is enjoying his time with the Stratos smart credit card, and were all excited about the new 27-inch Retina iMacs. Except Matt, who thinks his home-brew computer is better for some inexplicable reason. Luckily, we all still love each other, which is proven in the fact that John has to cut us off every single week (because we just want to keep on chatting). We discuss all this and more on this weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast featuring Matt Burns, Jordan Crook,Darrell Etherington, and John Biggs.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific.
