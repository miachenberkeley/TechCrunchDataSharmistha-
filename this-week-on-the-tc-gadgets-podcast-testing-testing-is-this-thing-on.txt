Not going to lie: I have no idea what this is.My attempted explanation is that we were told that we should do video podcasts, and instead of turning on a webcam like normal people, we decided to record ourselves within the world of Minecraft. Why did we choose to do it that way? I dont know. Is it compelling in any way? Again, I dont know.I do know, however, that we talk briefly about Samsungs new phones, the Boogie Board Jot 8.5, and the Coolest Cooler. Oh, and very elementary controls for Minecraft.This weeks episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast features John Biggs,Matt Burns, Natasha Lomas, Romain Dillet, and Jordan Crook.We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here.Click here to download an MP3 of this show.
