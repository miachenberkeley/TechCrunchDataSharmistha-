Today marked a special episode of TCBTC, TechCrunchs bitcoin podcast, as both John Biggs and myself were in the same city. We crashed the TCTV studio to shoot a video build of our little show.This time around, we dug into Coinbases new exchange and what it might mean for the maturation of bitcoin itself, along with a look at a massive bitcoin mining operation that constitutes a material percentage of the larger processing network that powers the blockchain.Well be back to an audio setup next week with a guest or two. Have a great weekend, everyone.
