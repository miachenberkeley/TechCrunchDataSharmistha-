Hello and welcome back to a much-delayed episode of TCBTC, TechCrunchs bitcoin podcast that went on accidental hiatus.John Biggs and I are back on the bitcoin beat. This time around, we dug into recent price fluctuations that have brought media attention back to the cryptocurrency. As we have noted before, the more that the price of bitcoin moves, the more than the public pays attention to the larger technology.Also this week, JPMorgans CEO Jamie Dimon made mouth noises about bitcoin that appeared to disassociate bitcoin from the blockchain. It isnt clear if Dimon was kidding, confused, or essentially saying that compute power behind blockchains should be subsidized, or paid for by financial institutions.Regardless, we are back, and we are glad that you are here.
