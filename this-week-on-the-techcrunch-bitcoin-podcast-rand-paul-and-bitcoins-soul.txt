We are back for another episode of TCBTC, TechCrunchs bitcoin podcast, a show that John Biggs and I put on because, well, cryptocurrencies are cool and we are not.This week we dug into Senator Rand Pauls news, while also exploring some commercial applications of blockchains, and whining about the current Bitcoin v. Blockchain debate. Just another week in bitcoin. I dont think we mentioned the price of bitcoin a single time, which is some sort of feat.Thankfully, the audio issues that plagued our last rendition have been sorted this week. We love you all, and are happy to hear from you. Holler.Download MP3Subscribe on iTunes.You can subscribe to the show here.
