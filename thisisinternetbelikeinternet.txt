The Be Like Me meme (that stick figure about [insert name here] blowing up on your Facebook feed) is the latest viral hit glorifying our greatness  and its annoying the hell out of your friends.According to the BBC, the meme started late last year for a guy named Bill. The Be Like Bill meme recently gained a dedicated Facebook page, which quickly grew to more than 1.5 million likes. There are even parodies like the Spanish version Se Como Jose and Be Like Emily for the ladies.But the meme started blowing up on my Facebook feed (and probably yours) over the weekend when a newly createdmeme generator allowed the ability to insert your own name instead of Bills.The attention has annoyed a lot of people who suddenly found their Facebook feed covered in passive-aggressive messages. It has also caused a counter meme Dont be like Bill or Emily.According to the Be Like Bill memes originatorEugeniu Croitoru, a Moldovian programmer living in Italy, Bill is Just a fictional character who conveys messages in a funny yet often sensible ways. His meme co-conspirator Debabrata Nathalso emphasized that Bill is there to make us laugh and has no resemblance to any real life person.The idea came to Croitoru after posting a similar stick figure meme on his gaming pageVideogamemes.The Be Like Bill version blew up so he and Nath made a separate page from there.Both versions seem to be very popular, but the Be Like Me meme, some outlets say was created a mere 48 hours ago, is the one covering my feed  and only highlights our enthusiasm to glorify ourselves on social media.Did it catch on based on our need to share with the world what we do and do not do right? Its tough to say what made this one catch  or what makes any meme go viral. But what can be said is that this meme will likely go the way of all the others and be over by next weekend. The haters will have to find a new meme to groan over then.
