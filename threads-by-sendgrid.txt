SendGrid CEO Sameer Dohlakia said he thinks of the companys new product, Threads by SendGrid, as the anti-spam.Basically, Threads allows customers to set up automated emails that getsent based on user activity  so you could send an email whenever a customer views a specific web page, uses a specific feature or performs a certain action in your mobile app.For someone like me, who doesnt spend all that much time thinking about email delivery and email marketing, this might soundsimilar towhats already offered by SendGrid and other companies.However, Dholakia said that if you wanted to send these types of targeted emails with a normal marketing tool, youd have to ask your developers to pull out a list of customers matching certain parameters, then create a custom campaign aimed specifically at those users. With Threads, you can set up rules and triggers without writing any code, so that those emails get sent automatically.Dholakia also said that Threads is allowing SendGrid (which says it already delivers 20 billion emails each month) to create a product thats aimed directly at marketers.It opens up a big swath of more marketing-centric emails that typically that have not flown through the SendGrid pipes, he said.He even argued that this could result in more relevant emails for consumers (hence the anti-spam comment): Anytime you put a powerful tool like this in the hands of marketers, they use their creativity to dream up lots of micro segments in terms of how they should be tailoring their messages based on some triggered behavior. Theyre not broad-based, feels-like-spam emails.
