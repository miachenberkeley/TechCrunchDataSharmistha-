Three men were charged in a 23-count indictment in connection with the 2014 hacking of J.P. Morgan Chase and multiple other financial institutions.Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein were first arrested in Israel in July. The third man,Joshua Samuel Aaron, is a U.S. citizen who attended school in Florida and then lived in Tel Aviv and Moscow.The charges, first reported by Reuters, include computer hacking and wire fraud.83 million household and business accounts were jeopardized in theJ.P. Morgan breach last year. According to the indictment, the victims of the hack were in New York, Boston, Omaha, St. Louis and Charlotte.Anthony Murgio, a Florida man who attended school with Aaron, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in a separate indictment.The breach on the nations largest bank has drawn media scrutiny because FBI agents have said it was not particularly sophisticated. Oddly enough, both Aaron and Murgio were fraternity brothers at Florida State, and the New York Times reportedtheconnections between alumni of the university and the hack extend beyond the two men.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasalso filed charges against Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein.Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, will hold a press conference this afternoon to explain the charges.
