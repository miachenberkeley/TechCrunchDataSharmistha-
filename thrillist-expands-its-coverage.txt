Heres one way that ThrillistMedia Group is spending the $54 million that it raised earlier this year: Its adding three new sections to its website, one for entertainment, one for health and one for sex and dating.Naturally, the company is supporting this expansion with some new hires. John Sellers, former senior editor at New York Magazines Vulture, will run the entertainment vertical. Anthony Schneck, former managing editor of MindBodyGreen, is the new health editor. And Nicole Caldwell, former editor in chief of Playgirl (!), will serve as sex and dating editor.Founded a decade ago by Ben Lerer (pictured above) and Adam Rich, Thrillist is a lifestyle site for men, and until now was largely focused on food, drink and travel. President of Sales Eric Ashman said the new sectionsare evolutions of the content weve already been doing.Sex and dating has an obvious connection to food and drink, but more broadly, Ashman said Thrillist aims to help readers drive decision-making in their everyday lives. And while the company is currently focused on these three launches, its also considering the addition ofeven more categories next year: Its certainly not the last of our expansion, for sure.The company is also announcing that it has hired Bill McCandless, former vice presidentof video programming and productionatBleacher Report, to expand its video production efforts. Oh, and its techsiteSupercompressor is now a section on the main Thrillist website.Ultimately, our goal is to build a preeminent lifestyle destination for millennial guysand for a broader audience beyond that, Ashman said. The phrase we use is,people that want to live fun lives.
