Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. Last week I had the opportunity to catch up with James Beshara, Co-Founder at Tilt in San Francisco and one the leaders in the emerging world of revolutionizing fintech and payments.In what turned out to be a pretty strategic and hilarious interview we discussed a range of topics including the onboarding process for users on mobile, the importance of customer retention, his experience raising $37m from the likes of a16z, SV Angel, Sean Parker and Naval Ravikant and what investors really want when investing in Silicon Valley startups.Beshara also discussed why crowdfunding has a similar narrative arc to blogging, his strategy for finding the best co-founder and why he believes simplification is key to success.
