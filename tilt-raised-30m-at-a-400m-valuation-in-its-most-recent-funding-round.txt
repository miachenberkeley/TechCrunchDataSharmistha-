TechCrunch is hearing from multiple sources that Tilt has raised around $30 million in its most-recent funding round as it pushes to expand internationally.We werent in fundraising mode  there was strong outside interest with minimal dilution, and Khaled and I felt like it was the right move for the business, Tilt CEO James Beshara said. Were executing the same as before the fundraising and obviously feel extremely fortunate for the additional vote of confidence as we build Tilt to be the crowdfunding platform for the mobile world. The next few years will be exciting ones to watch in the crowdfunding space.Much of the companys ambitions this year are set on its international expansion as it continues to grow in Canada  where it launched last year and is growing faster than Tilt did in the U.S. when it first launched  and soft-launches in new countries. Tiltalso launched in the United Kingdom. Thatkind of funding makes sense, as expanding to international countries not only requires technical acumen but people as well. Tilt expects to have more than 1,000 college ambassadors at the end of August, and the company has to hire people whoknow those regions well in order to effectively expand.People can use Tilt to raise money for an event, like funding a charity event. The event has to hit a certain level of funding before anyone who committed to paying for the project actually ends up putting money into it.While the funding was raised earlier this year, Tilts venture capital activity also comes around a time whenpreviously bootstrapped GoFundMe raised at a $600 million valuation. In that round, investors took a controlling stake and the founders essentially cashed out, making a small fortune in the process. Throughout that process we heard that GoFundMes numbers were incredible, signaling the ability to make a lot of money in the crowdfunding space.Update:Weve added a comment from Tilt CEO James Beshara.
