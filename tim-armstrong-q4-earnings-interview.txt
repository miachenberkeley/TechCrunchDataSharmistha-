During todays call with analysts, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong laid out some of his plans and priorities for 2015, and he elaborated on those plans in a short TechCrunch interview afterward.This comes after AOL laid off what we heard was about 150 employees, and closed two of its tech sites, Joystiq and TUAW  though they survive, to an extent, as parts of Engadget. Armstrong told analysts that the company will continue to invest in other areas, including the Huffington Post, its womens sites and tech sites (AOL owns TechCrunch), and its ad platform, where the company is working to create a sales force and revenue channel structure for the new world of advertising.In order to pay for those investments, however, Armstrongsaid the leaner and faster AOL had to take resources from existing lower-priority organizations.During our interview, Armstrong described this as a one-time move: The plan around the restructuring was to do [something] that would allow us to do it all at once. And were not only doing restructuring, but investing tens of millions of dollars back into the business.He saidthe company is responding to broader industry changes  including the importance of creating global online brands, the growth of video, and the growth of programmatic advertising, where ad buying and selling is done in a more automated fashion.On the ad side, I was curious about the custom content team that Armstrong mentioned during the call. Hetold me that these teams already exist in pockets throughout AOL, but this will allow the company to pursue more unified sponsored content initiatives. As for whether this team is at odds with AOLs push toward programmatic, Armstrong said, Theyre basically 100 percent complementary. Advertisers have two needs  the first is that they need to make sure brands dont get commoditized around content, while the second piece is that brands have to use automation for the scale that the industry has changed to.By the way, even though Armstrong stayed positive during our interview, those earnings actually didnt go so well for AOL, with disappointing fourth-quarter revenue numbers leading to a significant drop in stock price. We didnt discuss Wall Streets disappointment specifically, but Armstrong did highlight the fact that 2014 was the companys second consecutive year of growth in revenue and profitability, leading him to suggest that AOL is the only large Internet company I know of to go through the first generation of the Internet and come back strong in the second generation.That might be a surprise to the seemingly endless supply of TechCrunch readers who respond to any story about the company by asking, Wait, AOL still exists?I did bring this up, indirectly, by asking whether AOL will eventually become a name thats known primarily to investors and advertisers. Armstrong said that the core AOL brand will be around for a long, long time, while its focus is shifting from connecting humans to the Internet to curating the Internet. Looking ahead, he suggested that the company will have three massive components, namely the corporation, the consumer brand, and the other brands (like TechCrunch) and ad platform business.And yes, because anyone who interviews Armstrong is contractually obligated to bring up those Yahoo acquisition rumors (and more recently a report that Verizon was interested in buying the company), I did ask.Armstrong suggested that this kind of speculation happens because, In a very natural way, AOL comes up in tons of conversations around other companies strategies. But its not that were aligning ourselves with other companies, its that their strategies are coming towards us.He added that there theres a big difference between the extent to which companies are discussed externally and internally at AOL.The conversations around Yahoo  in general, we dont spend any time focused on Yahoo or worried about Yahoo, he said. Weve focused on AOL, and I think thats why weve been successful.
