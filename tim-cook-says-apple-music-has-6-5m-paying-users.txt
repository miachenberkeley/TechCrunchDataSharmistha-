Its been three and a half months since Apple Music launched and, with the first wave of users free three-month trial periods coming to a close at the end of October, Apple has given a taste of how it is faring. Company CEO Tim Cook said the service currently has 6.5 million paying users. On top of that, Cook shared that there are 8.5 million people using the free trial right now.Back in August, Apple saidthat it had 11 million people on thetrial, so it converted just over half of them into paid users. (More on that below.) Apple Musics figures aresome way short of Spotifys 20 million paying customer base, but its not a bad effort for the new service  which isnt yet available on Android and has no free listening option. That former is important in emerging markets, while the latter canhelp snare more conservative users and convert them to paying customers later.Huge caveat though:music streaming services are fairly notorious for muddying the waters when it comes to user numbers. Deezer, the French firm that is going public this month, claims 6.3 million paying subscribers, for instance, yet just 1.5 million are actualpaying members.Apple Music may be similarly vague with its big numbers, since a decent chunk of that 6.5 million may be peoplewho forgot to cancel their free trial and involuntarily became paying members.That might sound easily avoidable but it happened to some staffers at TechCrunch.Ill spare the names and save their embarrassment  the point is that it is very easy to become a paying Apple Music customer without necessarily meaning to be one.Cook, who was speaking at the Wall Street Journals Live event, also discussed Apples plans for CarPlay, security and the new Apple TV, which he revealed is launching next week.
