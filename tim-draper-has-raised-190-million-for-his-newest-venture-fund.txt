I am just skipping a fund to do some work building Draper Universitywhich is Drapers boarding school for aspiring entrepreneursand experimenting with new models for venture capital.Hed added at the time: I will of course be an investor in any new fund we create.That last part is true; Draper remains an investorin DFJs funds, including its newest, $350 million, vehicle, closed in February.As for just skipping a fund, it looks more permanent than that. In fact, Draper is announcing today that he has just raised a brand new, $190 million early-stage fund that he will co-lead with his son, Billy, as well as Andy Tang.The brand the trio are using: Draper Associates, which has historically been a personal investment vehicle for Draper.

Tang, meanwhile, was a longtime managing director at DFJ Dragon Fund; he has also served as the CEO of Drapers co-working space, Hero City.Another son of Draper, Adam Draper, separately co-founded and remains very involved with an early-stage acceleratorcalledBoost.vc.Drapers father and grandfather were famously VCs.Drapers own bets have included Skype and Baidu. He has also invested a personal fortune in bitcoin on the belief that itmight one day be the preeminent store of value for investors.Of his newest fund, he saysthe capital has already been used to invest in a dozen companies, including Compology,a four-year-old, San Francisco-based logistics company for the waste management industry. The company, which has raised an undisclosed amount of funding, puts itssensor into dumpsters,enablinggarbage companies to increase the efficiency of their routes based on howfull the dumpsters are.Draper Associates has also recently backedVerge Genomics, a San Francisco-based Y Combinator alum that raised $4 million in seed funding in November andaims to analyze multiple genes at once to find drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.In an email exchange late last week, Draper said Draper Associates has a wide array of interests.
