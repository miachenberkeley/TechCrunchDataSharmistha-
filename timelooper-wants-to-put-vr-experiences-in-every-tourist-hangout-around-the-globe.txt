What makes historical sites and areas significant isnt generally just what you see at face value. Where pamphlets and audio tours fall short is in truly conveying the deep history that lends significance to these locations.TimeLooper, launching today onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt NYs Startup Battlefield, is looking to give tourists and visitors deeper historical insights into locations via virtual reality. The service, which uses the Google Cardboard smartphone VR platform, has previously beenbuilding up content for London, but will be launching itsservices todayin New York City at some of the major tourist sites, including Times Square, Top of the Rock, Empire State Building, Federal Hall and Dakota.COO Andrew Feinberg wants TimeLooper to be the app thatcollects the most amazing moments in history.The experience is geofenced, which seemsa bit odd, considering you have to actually be at the geographic location to experience that geographical location virtually. But Feinberg said this was done with the intent of more closely aligning the location with its virtual history, which you cant do from your couch.One way to think about the service is as the 21st century update to the museum audio tours of old. TimeLooper doesnt just want to add context, but also a highly visual narrative that recounts the past in a virtual reality setting.TimeLooper is operating as a one-stop-shop at the moment, utilizing the$2 million it raised from Rothenberg Ventures earlier this year to seek out customers and produce VR content in-house for them.We can use VR to help people immerse themselves at these distincthistoric locations and relive the most important moments that happened there, Feinberg said.The particularly advantageoussituation that TimeLooper has set itself up in involves targetingconsumers when their wallets are most vulnerable. Here, thetourists havejust dropped hundreds ofdollarson a plane ticket and hotel, theyve already bought the $9 large bottled water and now theyrepreparing to unload their wallets on the general admission tickets, so whats tossing in a few more bucks to up the experience?
