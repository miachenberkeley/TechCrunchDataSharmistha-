Tinder released an update today that integrates directly with Instagram, letting users scroll through the Instagram profiles of their potential matches within the app itself.Tinder now also supports common connections, letting users see the degree to which theyre separated from a person based on the social graph, as well as presenting all Facebook interests instead of just common interests.The Instagram integration is the most important piece here, as a high percentage of Tinder users already include their Instagram handle within their profile, to give potential mates a more rounded-out view of their life. With Instagram inside Tinder, users can click into a users Instagram profile and see the most recent 34 pictures, with the ability to click directly into their profile to see the whole thing, check out comments, who liked it, and more granular details.For users who have private Instagram accounts, they will be presented with an option to grant Tinder access, which would make your Instagram public on Tinder only.The updated Tinder also adds common connection information into the mix, letting you see that you share a mutual friend with a match (first degree) or that you and your match have two separate friends who happen to be friends with each other (second degree). Essentially, what LinkedIn usually refers to as second- and third-degree connections, Tinder calls first- and second-degree connections, respectively.Beyond that, Tinder has also included all of your Facebook interests on your profile, with the hopes to make it easier for users to get the conversation going.This is the first of many steps to take the recommendations engine to the next level and help you assess the person youre matching with and start those conversations, said Tinder cofounder and President Sean Rad. If we can provide our users with more relevant information for each connection, we can take them halfway there in terms of getting a conversation going.Tinder recently introduced Tinder Plus, an ad-free paid tier of the service and includes access to premium features like PassPort and Rewind, letting you search for matches globally and go back on an accidental left swipe, respectively. Tinder Plus costs between $10 and $20, depending on age.That said, features included in todays update are available to all users, both free and paid.The update for Tinder can be found in the App Store and on Google Play.
