Weve been warning you all week. Weve given you ample time to get out ahead of this. But today is the day. And by the day I mean the last day to register for Disrupt NY with the early bird pricing, which saves you about $1000. But I shouldnt have to convince you  our speakers list should do the trick. Well be joined by tech bigwigs like Aaron Levie, Fred Wilson, Ron Conway, Sean Rad, Dennis Crowley, Limor Fried, and many many more. Tech leaders from across the globe, including founders, CEOs, investors, and even the Chairman of the FCC will hop up on stage to answer a few questions and dole out some advice. But maybe you like to fast-forward through the Game Of Thrones talking scenes to get to the real battles. Well, youre in luck. Disrupt has its own Battlefield filled with startups, all of whom are vying for the top prize of $50,000 and the right to take home the Disrupt Cup. And then theres the Startup Alley, where hundreds of companies from all over the world will have the chance to pitch passersby in what is likely the largest startup mall in the world. Investors, get your checkbooks out and ready. You know, now that I think about it, Silicon Valley may be a more apt reference than Game of Thrones, given that Disrupt is actually part of the story line in HBOs new show about tech life. But no matter which HBO shows you love, Disrupt will have something for you. So dont tarry on getting a good price for your tickets. You can do that right here. The show runs May 4-6 at the historic Manhattan Center. Tickets are available at an early-bird discount rate until April 11.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
