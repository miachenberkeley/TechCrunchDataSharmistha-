Last week, we witnessed something fairly remarkable. A major Alphabet executive Nest Labs CEO TonyFadell  publicly shamed the cofounder and employees ofDropcam, the connected camera company thatNesthad acquired in 2014 for $555 million.In an article inThe Information, Fadell saidthat he didnt think Dropcam cofounder and CEO Greg Duffy hadearned the right to report to himdirectly. Fadellalso explained awayanexodus of Dropcam staffersby suggesting theyweresubpar.A lot of the employees were not as good as we hoped, he told The Information. It was a very small team and unfortunately it wasnt a very experienced team.Fadell may have beenreacting to commentsby Duffy, whopainteda highly unflattering portrait ofFadell in the same article.However,Fadells comments and his poorperformance underscore what an ill fit Fadell is for Alphabetand why Alphabet needs new leadership at Nest.It wasnt supposed to be like this, of course.Nest wasacquired by Google for $3.2 billion in January 2014, a feat that earned Fadellplenty of accolades. Worried about competitionand in awe of Fadell,whod createdtheiPod as an Apple SVP, Duffy concluded that selling was his smartest play when Nestcame knocking that spring.Despite what seemed like a handsome payday for everyone involved with Dropcam,the bet soonlooked like a poor one.As I reportedin November 2014,not only did Duffys beloved VP of marketing almost immediately leave Nest over an apparent culture clash, but numerous employees I interviewed, along with scathing write-upsby former employees onGlassdoor,pointed surprisingly to trouble.Everything revolves around the CEO, wrote one Glassdoor reviewer at the time. Its a dangerous mix of cult of personality and Stockholm syndrome. Comments like [Fadell is] the next Steve Jobs are not uncommon, while people proudly say things like Im used to Tony screaming at me.It wasnt just the different management styles of Fadell and Duffy, whose organization was one-eighththe size of Nestand who was well-liked by his employees. There was suddenly an inability to get anything meaningful done. OneNest employee described to me ahuge meeting culture, to the point where anyone at the director level or up spends their entire day in meetings, many of them duplicative meetings about the same subject, over and over to the point where a lot of people have complained.Things remain much the same 16 months later, suggests The Information, whose report says Nests culture of micromanagement hasmore recently led thefirm to plasterits offices with the phrase Step Up to ostensibly encourage lower-level employees to take more initiative.Duffy wouldnt speak with me back in 2014 when he was still working forFadell, but having left last fall to start something new, he isnt holding back from sharing his experience now.He confirmed toThe Information that he wasembarrassed by Nests products and that hed called Fadell a tyrant bureaucrat to his face. Inthewake of Fadells comments about Dropcam employees to The Information, Duffyfurthertook to Medium yesterday todefend those engineers.In the same post, healso called outNests management for fetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors.Asked yesterday and today to commentforthis story,Nest declined.Certainly, ithasseemed at times likeFadell is playing at Steve Jobswith whom he worked closelyin ways that seem very contrary to how Alphabet runsits other operations.Fadellcouldnt be further apart fromGoogles CEO Sundar Pichai, who is widely reported to be humble and team-oriented to a fault, or from Alphabet CEO Larry Page, whooftenwanders through academicconferencesand engages in tte-a-ttes with prominent scientists (without assuming they know who he is). Even Google Ventures CEO Bill Maris has jokingly said that he merely masquerades as a venture capitalist.Fadellacknowledged the cultural differences between Google/Alphabet and Apple after Nest was acquired, telling anon-stage interviewerin 2014 that Apple had amuch more hierarchical structure, and the communications structure was very understood, while at Google, everyone could just talk to everyone and learn about everything, and there was much more transparency.Im not saying one is better than the other, Fadell continued at the time. But its very different. The very first day, when the [Nest] deal was announced, I got all these various individuals from inside Google saying, Oh, congratulations, and I want to work with you, and Is there something we can help you with? And at Apple, it was very structured. It wasnt like you were going to send a message to Steve for any reason and say congratulations and flood his email box.Time goes by, so slowlyOne can understand why Google wanted Nest to spearhead its hardware efforts. As a private company, Nest had come up withitsbeautiful, signaturethermostat andwas presumed to havemuch more up itssleeve.Fadell is reportedly friends with Page. Not last, one of Nests investors was Google Ventures, which likelymade the arrangement a little more attractive for everyone involved.Yet from the outside looking in, Nest has seemingly devolved from arevolutionary outfit to an iterative one.Thoughthecompany currently manufacturesthree products its thermostat, asmoke alarm, and its Nest cam (via its Dropcam acquisition)  it has repeatedly delayed product releases and disappointed its customers, particularly given the billing that Nestsproducts receive.In one of the more visible cases of customer dissatisfaction, a New York Times reporter said in January that a software bug drained his Nest thermostatsbattery, a discovery he made only when hisinfantbegan crying from his chilly bedroomin the middle of the night. Nests smart smoke alarm has also been plagued by software glitches.In the meantime, saysThe Information,Google has moved forward on similar efforts, including its OnHubwireless router and a stealth project to create a competitor to Amazons Echo.That Google hasdone so without Nests involvement must be demoralizing to Nests current employees, who were presumably drawn to the challenge of helpingNest become one of the worldsgreat hardware companies.But theres reason for even more concern going forward:Fadell has created a culture thats increasingly unlikely to attract the worlds best engineers, which has always been the top priority for its parent company. (Google, in stark contrast, isconsistently ranked as one of the best places to work.)If Alphabet wants to maintain its feel-good reputation, it may be timeto part ways withFadell, or at least to demote him.Hes nowhad more than two years to prove himself.What Fadell has shown insteadisthat hes unable toget out of his own way or Nests.
