In honor of our recent joyous union, I present the top five Verizon commercials that I was able to find in about 10minutes. It should be noted that I have never had Verizon service  mostly because they had awful international coverage for most of the decade. I also think I pissed off their PR person once a long time ago and I havent actively covered them since 2010 or so. Anyway, enjoy!5.
I dont really know who they were fighting here. Probably AT&T. These split-screen ones have been a bane on my TV-watching experience recently, mostly because the message is far from clear.4.
This commercial hits particularly hard in that it describes a product that I cant have in deepest Brooklyn. Seriously. The company cant get me FiOS in Bay Ridge. I also wouldnt let that dude touch my wireless network, ever.3.
This, I assume, is the first Can You Hear Me Now dude commercial. A modern classic indeed.2.So this one is actually nice but it doesnt have much to do with telecoms. Who knew?1.
This is quite unique. Its video from inside Verizon headquarters as they prepared to board AOL this morning. Verizon CEO Lowell C. McAdam is surprisingly candid in this snippet and it seems like well all get along just fine.So there you have it: five indicative Verizon commercials that have stood out, by dint of them appearing first in Google, as modern classics. Its rare to find a company with such cogent and ceaseless messaging.
