Pond5, a company allowing usersto buy and sell stock videos, photos and other media content, is adding to its board of directors a big name from ad industry Torrence Boone, Googles vice president of global agency sales and services.Boonecomes from the ad agency world, having previously worked atWPP, Publicis and Avenue A. His appointment could help Pond5 make further inroads into striking partnerships with agencies, brands and creators.Not that the company has done too badlyon that front  its been used by organizations and artists includingVice, MTV, HBO and Macklemore/Ryan Lewis. It even got a fun shout out on John Olivers Last Week Tonight.Boone told mePond5 is well-positioned thanks to many of the broader changesin the marketing industry: You look at this hyper-fragmented world, with the need for quick turnaround and much more cost-efficient production capabilities. Theyve built this technology platform that addresses all of those secular shifts and its created this pipeline of independent creators.In addition to announcing Boones appointment, Pond5 is celebrating the upload of its five millionth video, which comes from user Gali17, who will get a B&H gift certificate.Looking ahead, the company is planning to move into 360-degree video for use in virtual reality content  in fact, the teamgave me a quick demo of some early VR content and it looked great,allowing me to explore a number of different locations across the country (maybe the world?) in just a few minutes.
