Toshiba has canceled its smart glasses less than one week before the devices were to start shipping. In an announcement today, the Japanese electronics company said it made the decision to stop developing and selling Wearvue TG-1 as part of an effort to streamline its business portfolio and operations.The firm is struggling to recover from a $1.9 billion accounting scandal and has been hit with a 7.3 billion yen (about $65.7 million) fine from Japans Financial Services Agency for falsifying its 2011 and 2012 financial statements.As part of rehabilitation effort, Toshiba announced that it will restructure to reduce costs by cutting jobs and selling off some segments, including its medical equipment unit.A company representative told the Wall Street Journal that the Wearvue, which was announced on Jan. 13,had gained enough interest that it wanted to consider until the very last minute whether to cancel its release.Designed for enterprise use, the Wearvue was meant to free the hands of workers in factories and logistics centers by projecting lists and images onto its right-hand lens. The smart glasses were slated to be the first in a series of devices that would contribute to upgrading working environment for various industries and services, the company said last month.A Toshiba representative told TechCrunch there are no plans to continue developing Wearvue in the future.
