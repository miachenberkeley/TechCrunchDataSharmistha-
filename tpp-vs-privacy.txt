Measures agreed to in an international trade treaty between Pacific Rim countries threaten Internet users privacy and consumer rights, civiland digital rights organizations havewarned today.The full text of the Trans Pacific-Partnership (TPP) international trade agreement some eightyears in the negotiating  waspublished online earlier today (in a version marked subject to legal review), after agreement was reached between the 12 countries early last month, which includethe U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand.The text still needs to be ratified in the individual countries before the treatybecomes binding.The E-Commerce chapter has serious implications for online privacy, said Peter Maybarduk, of non-profit consumer rights organization,Public Citizen, in a statement on TPP. The text reveals that policies protecting personal data when it crosses borders could be subject to challenge as a violation of the TPP.Public Citizen says the agreement puts arequirement oncountries to allow unregulated cross-border transfer of Internet users data and prohibits governments from requiring companies host data on local servers  with what it says is no express protection for privacy and data protection policies to be exempted from the rules.Rather it says policies would be subject to review by TPP tribunals to determineif they meet what itdubs highly subjective, restrictive standards.This meansgovernments seeking to protect consumerprivacy via conditioning international data transfers on compliance with data protection regulations could find their policies exposed to challenges by other governments under the TPP  as well as via extra-judicial tribunals agreed via the treatys controversial Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism.In some cases, our data may be vulnerable in another country  to surveillance or marketing abuses  in ways that it is not at home, continuesMaybarduk. The TPP could limit governments ability to protect us against such threats.TPP seeks to governmultiple aspects of trade and economic policy, with a stated goal oflowering barriers to trade and promoting economic activity. However, as with other such expansive international trade agreements  such as the still-being-negotiated TTIP, between the European Unionand the U.S.  there has been plenty of controversy already, not least over thesecrecy of the negotiations.Thescope ofproposed measures in TPP has also caused major alarm, after portions of the agreement were leaked during negotiations.For example, the EFF has slammedTPPs stance on copyright, such as the extensionof copyright terms andprohibition on circumvention of DRM, writing in an analysis last month: If you look for provisions in the TPP that actually afford new benefits to users, rather than to large, rights-holding corporations, you will look in vain.Responding to the publication of the full text today, the EFFis no lessdamning  saying, for example, that the copyright chapter contains dangerous threats to the publics rights to free expression, access to knowledge, and privacy online (the full text of the IP chapter can be read here)  and describingtheInvestment chapters definition of intellectual property as an asset that can be subject to the investor-state dispute settlement process as shocking.What this means is that companies could sue any of the TPP nations for introducing rules that they allege harm their right to exploit their copyright interests  such as new rights to use copyrighted works for some public interest purpose. A good example of this might be a country wishing to limit civil penalties for copyright infringement of orphan works, which are works whose authors are deceased or are nowhere to be found, the EFFwrites on the latter point.The digital rights organizationis also  like Public Citizen  critical of the treatys bid torestrict the use of data localization laws.Although we generally agree that data localization is an ineffective approach to the protection of personal data, a trade agreement is the wrong place for a sweeping prohibition of such practices, the EFFwrites. For particularly sensitive user data, regulating cross-border transfer of that data or its storage on vulnerable overseas servers may be a valid policy option.The E-Commerce chapter does not prohibit recourse to this option altogether, but imposes a strict test that such measures must not amount to arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade  a test that would be applied by an investment court, not by a data protection authority or human rights tribunal, it adds.So the EFF is basically making the same critique as Public Citizen  that corporate interests are trumping privacy and human rights in TPP.Its also notable that measure to enforce international data flows are driving in the opposite direction vsthe recent rulingby the European Court of Justice invalidating the fifteen year old Safe Harbor data-transfer agreement between the U.S. and the EU  on the grounds that Europeans data was not being adequately protected under aself-certification regime. (It remains to be seen what TTIP will have to say on data flows. Truly that will be a *gets popcorn* moment.)The EFF saysTPP takes the same flawed approach as the old EU-U.S. Safe Harbor  i.e. that it tries to streamlinecross-border data-flows between regions with comprehensive data protection laws and those with weak or voluntary arrangements by encouraging the former to treat the latteras in some way equivalent to their own.Data flows often are beneficial. At the same time, rules mandating data flows should be narrowly tailored with exceptions that clearly and explicitly allow for the protection of privacy and individual liberties, adds Public Citizens Maybarduk. The memory of misuse of data and National Security Agency surveillance is so fresh, and we should be careful about giving up control of our data.Other criticisms of TPP by consumer and digital rights organizations include: weak provisions on net neutrality (and empty provisions on spam); inadequatedefinitions of personal information; weak protections for personal data  such as allowing companies to definetheir own self-serving standards (as the EFF puts it) when it comes to privacy; a lowering of consumer protection standards, given thatunfairness has been left out of theconsumer protection section leavingonly fraudulent and deceptive conduct to bespecificallyproscribed; prohibitions on government requiring the disclosure of source code for mass market software or products containing the software, therebylimiting the ability of countries to take steps to, for example, bolster the cybersecurity of such products.The EFF also attacksthe Telecommunications chapterfor subordinating the security and privacy of usersto the commercial interests of business  noting that the former are only allowed to be taken into account if it can be established that they are not a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services.This is completely backward, it adds. There is no value in having telecommunications services if they do not protect the privacy and security of end users; in fact, such services can be positively harmful, causing serious human rights infringements of users. In any other context, human rights would trump commercial considerations  in fact, this would go entirely without saying  but in the topsy-turvy world of trade negotiations, its the other way around.
