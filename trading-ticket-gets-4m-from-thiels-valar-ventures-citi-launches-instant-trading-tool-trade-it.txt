Finance technology has been one of the morelucrative areas in the world of disruptive startups, with companiespicking upbillions of dollars in private investment; and, by Goldman Sachs estimates, on track to grab $4.7 trillion of revenues away from established financial players. Now, makeway for one more new entranthopingto make its mark in fintech.Trading Ticket, a startupbased out of New York,wants to develop a suite of products that will help consumers become more active, and proactive, investors. It has closed a $4 million seed round as it gears up to officially launch its first product, a mobile-friendly securities trading tool called Trade It.While Trade It is just getting off the ground, thefunding in Trading Ticket is notable in that it is coming from two keynames in the fintech world: Valar Ventures, the investment fund started by PayPal co-founder and top VC Peter Thiel; and Citi Ventures, the investment arm of the Citi banking group. (Prior to this, the company hadraised an undisclosed amount in angel funding from Newfund, and was largely bootstrapped it tells me.)Trading Ticketsthree co-founders have equally notable backgrounds. CEONathan Richardson has leda number of finance and content businesses, includingWayWire, Yahoo Finance, AOL and others.Serge Kreiker is formerly of Bloomberg, and Gaspard de Dreuzy is a co-founder and CEO of doctor house call app Pager. The latter two are also co-founders of Kapitall.Trading Ticket has wide ambitions. The idea isto develop a series of mobile and desktop productscovering all manner of financial transactions: apps to help people open accounts; access credit; place orders for shares and communicate with each other and their financial service providers.Trade It, the first product,will focus on the third of these areas. Its an API-based servicethat lets peopleplace orders for trades instantly and securely directly on third-party sites, apps or Twitter.It works by linking up mentions of a company name, ticker symbol or shortened URL with order tickets that connect witha users brokerage accounts, letting them place orders on the fly.It also will mark the first time that an ETF (exchange trading fund, or a marketable security that tracks an index, a bond, a commodity or a basket of assets) can be traded directly without the need to go through a registered investment adviser.Trade It will make money in three ways, Richardson says: by way oftransaction revenue and taking a fee per order; marketing sponsorships (essentially ad units that will run in the trading order ticket); and technology licensing fees.Early partners for Trade It will includefinancial mobile appsStock Tracker, Stocks Live, Rubicoin, and Invstr; and its also working with Benzinga, MarketWatch, The Motley Fool, TheStreet.com, VETR and ARK Invest for ETFs. Richardson says that the partnerships for the service will all be launching October 1. While the tech works both on desktop and mobile, to date, early usage of the service has seen some 80% of all orders placedvia mobile devices.Like e-commerceAPIs that let you buy items directly from places where you are talking or reading about them online, theidea here is to bring the process of trading directly to the places where you are already going to read and act on business news.In a way, given Richardsons background across both finance and content, its not really a surprise to see him working on a product that brings the two together.Trade It solves the three most difficult problems in mobile trading, said Richardson in a statement. Speed to trade forusers, order volume for brokers, and a direct monetization opportunity for publishers who dont want the conflict of becoming a broker-dealer.While there have been a lot of new services launched that take advantage of online and mobile innovations to cut down the time for certain financial services  online banking possibly being one of the most widely used  services focused on consumers and how they tradehas seen relatively little development.Trading Ticket is the first financial technology company to integrate mobile trading seamlessly into online publishing platforms, said Ramneek Gupta, Managing Director and Co-Head of investing at Citi Ventures, in a statement. Were excited to add them to our portfolio of investments that enable banking to come to the customer, empowering them to act anytime and anywhere.(More specifically, Richardson tells usthat after a user registers with the service, Trade It does not hold credentials for desktop use. We hold user name based on publisher preference, he notes. To make the trade on desktop, users need to enter a password, the amount of the order and then confirm to place the order. On mobile, he notes that some apps will let users store their broker credentials on iOS using TouchID, but users will still need to enter the order, number of shares and confirm with TouchID.)As part of the investment round, Andrew McCormack of Valar and DLJdirect founding CEO Blake Darcy are joining Trading Tickets board, with Gupta coming on as a board observer.Trading Tickets technology position, seasoned leadership team, and strong reception with both established and new financial services players is impressive, said Valars Andrew McCormack in a statement. We believe the global opportunity for integrated, mobile trading is very promising and Trade It is well positioned to capitalize on its most valuable areas.
