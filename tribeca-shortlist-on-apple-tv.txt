Tribeca Shortlist, the streaming movie service from Lionsgate and Tribeca Enterprises (the organization behind the Tribeca Film Festival), is releasing its Apple TV app today.Why does anyone need another movie subscription, even if it only costs $4.99 a month? Tribeca Shortlist President Jeff Bronikowski emphasized his servicesfocus on quality and curation.I just dont have time to be watching movies that I dont think are good, so I have trouble wading through huge, algorithmically-driven catalogs, he said.In contrast, Tribeca Shortlist offers a smaller catalog of movies handpicked by actors, filmmakers and other industry insiders, and usually accompanied by a brief video recommendation called a Shortlister. As evidence of quality, Bronikowski said the top 50 percent of movies available on the service have a Rotten Tomatoes score of about 90 percent.The company isnt releasing any subscriber numbers, but Bronikowski said growth is about on-plan  things are going well.When the service first launched last fall, it was only available on iPad and the web, but it has since expanded to Roku, Amazon Fire TV and now Apple TV. Next up is Android, where Bronikowski said the app will allow subscribers to download movies for offline viewing, just as it does on iOS.
