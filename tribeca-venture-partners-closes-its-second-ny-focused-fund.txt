Tribeca Venture Partners, a New York-based early-stage venture firm founded in 2011, is today announcing that it has closed its second fund with $107 millionsignificantly more thanits$65 million debut fund.Thats good news for New York startups. In a conversation earlier this week with Brian Hirsch and Chip Meakem  Tribecasco-founders and its sole investors (still)  they talked at length of their near-exclusive focus on the startups in their own backyard.That somewhat unique positioning apparently resonated with LPs. (Of the 25 companies backed with their first fund, 21 are based in New York.)As Hirsch and Meakemreadily concede, italso helps that Tribecasecured most of its LP commitments before the third quarter of last year, well in advance of the market turmoil that has followed.Investors are plainly backing Tribecas potential, too. With the oldest company in its portfolio just reaching theripe old age of four, it has seen just two minor exits, including one acqui-hire with the sale of the web TV startup NimbleTV to the publicly traded company Synacor last year.Meanwhile, othersof its bets have been marked up considerably, including the adtech company AppNexus;the iPad point-of-sale systemShopKeep;and the online lending company CommonBond.According to CrunchBase, AppNexus has raised $288 million to date (Tribeca joined its $75 million Series D round; the company has raised three subsequent rounds). ShopKeep has raised $97.5 million from investors (Tribeca led its $8.7 million Series A round). AndCommonBond, whose $2.2 million Series A was also led by Tribeca,has raised nearly $44 million to date, along with $275 million in debt.Of course, mark-ups arent the same as exits, and a lot of companies are beginning to look crippledfrom too muchfunding. AppNexus, for example, has long been a potential IPO target,yet hasnt managed to cross into the public market,in part because of the poor performance of adtech companies thattrade publicly. Meanwhile, its listof preferred shareholders has grown longer.Asked if Tribecais worried that AppNexus may have missed its window to go public, Meakem who wasone of the first employees at early adtech companyActive Imaginations (founded in 1995)says he is not.Ad tech has been in and out of favor since the ad server was created, said Meakem.Specific to AppNexus, the plan is to continue to grow a really good company. At some point, I think it will make sense to access public capital do to that, but we dont need to go public [right now]. AppNexuss business model and unit economics dont look like most of the other ad tech companies out there.
