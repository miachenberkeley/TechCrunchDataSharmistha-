As the Tribeca Film Festival winds down in New York City, were highlighting one of the most tech-driven parts of the event Storyscapes, which showcased 10 works of virtual reality and interactive storytelling.At Storyscapes, I talked to the creators of Notes on Blindness (which won the juried Storyscapes award), 69, The Argus Project and Network Effect, among others. One word that came up repeatedly was empathy  the idea of using technology to really put you in someone elses shoes and make you feel what they feel.Its also worth noting that even if you missed the event, many of these projects are also available through web versions, or at least have a website where you can find out more info  Ive linked to them above.
