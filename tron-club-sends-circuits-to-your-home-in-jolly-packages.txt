While Tron-Club sounds more like a weekly meeting of Tron enthusiasts who enjoy dressing up in unitards and making whooshing sounds as they pretend to ride invisible Lightcycles, its actually a service that sends circuits to your home. Why? Because you should learn electronics, thats why.As hardware becomes easier to build and understand, programmers are finding themselves at a loss. While we can all write a little Python in a pinch, putting together a circuit is another matter altogether. Using the Tron-Club packages you can learn how to build stuff like a pulsed Piezo buzzer, the utility of which is limited but still interesting and could be usable in other projects down the line.I am not bullish on educational circuit toys for kids. I think these things, which are essentially updated versions of the classic electronics kits arent interesting enough to hold attention. However, I think kids and adults can both learn from Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits while adults especially are helped by handling kits like Tron-Clubs.The service costs 14 a month or 150 (plus shipping.) You can cancel at any time.In the end electronics is all about making loud noises and magical smoke so its great to see Tron-Club provide us little fun while they learn electronics. Just dont zap your eye out.
