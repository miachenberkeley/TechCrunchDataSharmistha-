Facebook is Indias Facebook and Twitter is Indias Twitter, but Tinder wont be Indias Tinder.Thats according toSachin Bhatia, co-founder of TrulyMadly, an app that is aiming to take the mobile dating phenomenon fueled by the likes of Tinder and repackageit to fit with Indiassocial and cultural nuances.There is still a stigma around online dating, but our mandate is to make it more cool, Bhatia explained to TechCrunch in an interview.Bhatia, who co-founded top online travel site MakeMyTrip, sat down with two friends  MakeMyTrip colleagueRahul Kumar andHitesh Dhingra,founder of Flipkart owned-Letsbuy to brainstorm areas that were ripe for disruption last year after he exited hiscompany.The trio looked over a number of areas for new opportunities but were most taken by dating, and, in particular, the lack of services catering to the 18-26 year-old demographic. TrulyMadly was createdto fill that void.Certainelements resemble Tinder  mutual matches can begin private conversations inside the app  but TrulyMadly had adapted toIndia. Primarily the fact that women dontfeel safe talking to (and potentially meeting with) men who they dont know via an online service.We talked to women who told us that theyd be onboard if we could promise them verified profiles, and the chance to sift through men usingsome compatibility categories, he explained.TrulyMadlys most obvious difference fromTinder is that it uses trust-based scores to verify its users.You connect your Facebook profile to get started, and also verify yourself via other social networks, your phone number and even offline photo-ID to get more points. The companys algorithm checks that you are single and active on social networks, and your score thus increases.Thats an important factor for guys, Bhatia said, because generally speaking the higher their trust score, the morematches and likes they can attract from girls. The process, of course, also provides women with greater peace-of-mind about their potential matches.Tinder puts a lot of focus on location, but TrulyMadly instead looks to compatibility quizzes and scoring.Were not location specific because this works better from an Indian context, Bhatia said, People insmaller towns often want to meet and date people who are in bigger towns, while the pool of potential dates in small towns islimited.The company was founded last year, initially with an online site only before the founding trio realized the need for mobile apps. An Android shipped first, in August, and the iOS version followed last month.Bhatia explainedthat Android was firstbecause it has the most scale in India. While he doesnt except iOS downloads to catch up, he added that the Apple platform wasa prioritybecause it is used by early-adopters and influencers who can help get word of the service out.An appfor Windows Phone is expected to ship in the next month or so.TrulyMadly has reached 200,000 downloads so far, andaround a third of its users are female. The startuphas just announced a$5.6 million Series A roundthat Bhatia hopes will take it to the next level, and more specifically 3.5 million downloads by the end of the year.Helion Venture Partners led the round, with participation fromKae Capital, which Bhatia said should give the company 18 months of runway. Right now, it is not making money, but there are plans to introduce premium services, which might include paid-for stickers, location-based services for finding matches nearby, and the ability to view more than 10 profiles per day  thats the current maximum right now.Bhatia said that active users  so not all users  are currently using the service for around 40 minutes each day. Often, however, once they are matched with a partner, both parties then take the conversation to Facebook or WhatsApp, Indias top messaging app. In response, TrulyMadly is preparing to add more to its in-app messaging feature  including compatibility quizzes and ice-breaker intros  as it bids to keep users engaged inside its ecosystem.Growth so far been organic, according to Bhatia, and part of the funding will go towards creating new dating/relationship content for third-party social networks (like YouTube and Instagram) toattract new users. Bhatia said that, in the future, TrulyMadly may also create content that lives exclusively inside its service in order to sharpen its appeal.
