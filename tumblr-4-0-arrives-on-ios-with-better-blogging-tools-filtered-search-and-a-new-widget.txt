Tumblr this morning has begun toroll out a sizableupdate to its iOS application with the release of Tumblr 4.0. The new application, which also now appears under a revampedapp icon, includes a number of features previously available only on desktop, like the ability to create secondary blogs on the fly or submit to submission blogs, for example. Meanwhile, other additions are specifically designed for iOS, like the new Today widget.The widget, which takes advantage of Apples iOS 8 feature that allows youto view useful information and other content right on your Today screen, will display whats trending on Tumblr, rather than activity related to your own blog, or updates from your Tumblr network.In addition to the features mentioned above, which are focused on allowingyou to do more blogging from your iOS device by quickly creating moreblogs or participating in blogs that accept posts from others, the updated app also received a few features that had already rolled out toAndroid.This includes Tumblr users most-requested feature: the ability to makevideo posts simply by copying and pasting in a video URL.Plus, iOS users can now filter searches by post type  like photos, videos or chats  as well as move between the top resultsand the most recent results. These are features that havebeen available inthepopular third-party Tumblr app for power users XKitfor some time, but weresorely lacking in Tumblr for iOS itself.Also now arriving in the updated app are a handful of more minor improvements, including a sticky search bar, sticky avatars, a better iPad layout, better GIF loading (no seriously, thank you), and more.The updated Tumblr app began rolling out to iOS users as of 7 AM EST this morning, so if you dont see it yet, you should shortly.Update: This post originally noted an Experiments section was available under Settings. Tumblr explains this is an internal-only build feature.
