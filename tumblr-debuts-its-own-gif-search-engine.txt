Tumblr this morning is rolling out a new feature designed totake advantage of the extensive collection of GIFs hosted on its service: a GIF search engine. The news follows that of Facebooks decisionto officially support the animated file format on users Timelines, announced last week. With Tumblrs implementation, web users will now be able to more easily locate GIFs on Tumblr as well asadd themto their posts, while also properly crediting the GIFs original creator, the company says.The search engine doesnt relyon a third-party integration, such asa partnership with the popular GIF resource Giphy, for example, but instead only includes those GIFs that have been posted to the Tumblr platform.The GIFs are indexed and cataloged using Tumblrs search algorithms, which rely on tags to properly identify the GIFs.That means Tumblr users should be able to surface GIFs using less common keywords than on some other search services, including via unique Tumblr slang, sayings and other abbreviations that members of the various fandoms on Tumblr use. For example, a search for aos should be able to pull up GIFs related to the TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., while a search for hp could pull up GIFs related to the character Harry Potter, thanks to the way the engine has been designed. It also means users should be able to search Tumblrs GIFs by phrases that were included in the posts tags, like I want to believe, forX-Files GIFs, for instance.To determine which GIFs are ranked more highly in the search results, Tumblr takes a variety of factors into consideration, but engagement  including likes and reblogs  is a strong factor.Users who want to add a GIF to their post will now be able to do so by clicking the plus + button the web interface, then clicking the new GIF button and entering in their search terms. After selecting the GIF, its automatically added to the postalong with a credit for the creator, which appears immediately below the image with a link to the original post.That person will be notified that their GIF has been used and linked through notifications which are pushed out across all platforms, including web and mobile.The GIFs are indexed from across all of Tumblr, whose site today includes over 239 million blogs with more than 80 million new posts daily. Currently, there are more than 112 billion posts on Tumblr, many of which include GIFs.What makes Tumblrs search service interestingis that the site has, for a long time, been known to be one of the web destinations that helped influencethe GIFs comeback over the years. The file format grewpopular in the web early days as a way to add visual interest and movement to web pages. But as internet speeds increased and computing technology improved, GIFs were discarded for some time in favor of more high-quality files.In recent years, however,GIFs have been seeing a renaissance of sorts. But these days, GIFs tend to emerge from edited video files, sometimes with advanced effects like filteringor adjustments in speed, as opposed to Web 1.0s GIFs which were often crude animations, like the once-ubiquitous dancing banana GIF or the flashing under construction sign for web pages still being built.And Tumblr has served to host many of these newer, more modern GIFs for years, including a number of original creations.At launch, Tumblrs GIF Search is only available on the web, but attribution and notifications are on all platforms, including Android and iOS. Tumblr hasnt yet said when the feature will make its way to Tumblrs mobile apps, but it seems it would make sense to include it in the future.
