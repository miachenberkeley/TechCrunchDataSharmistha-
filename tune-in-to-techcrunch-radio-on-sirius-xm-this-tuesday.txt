Its clear, based on the fact that youre reading this article, that you enjoy visually consuming TechCrunch content. But what if I told you that you could listen to TC on the radio? Im sure it seems like something out of a dream, but TechCrunch Radio is real and the show airs every Tuesday at 6pm ET / 3pm PT. Even better, TC Radio is home to the TC Radio Pitch-off, where five companies have exactly sixty seconds to pitch their startup on the radio. We usually pull in a guest judge from the VC community to help us determine a winner, and on the whole, its a lot of fun. We invite you to listen in each Tuesday evening to Sirius XM Insight 121. And if you want to participate in the pitch-off, follow instructions below. Rules:
1. You must have a product that is available to general users. No sign-up pages or pre-orders with a TBD ship date. There must be a link we can give to listeners/readers where they can access your product, service, what have you.
2. You must be an early stage company. If you have raised a Series A or later, you are disqualified. Bootstrapped or seed stage startups are welcome.
3. You must be able to pitch your product with your words only.
4. You must be able to operate a telephone.Apply:Apply here.Its going to be a hoot!Each week, TechCrunch Radio will air Tuesdays at 6:00 pm ET with a replay at 6:00 pm PT, drive time for both coasts, on Sirius XM Insight 121, and through the SiriusXM Internet Radio App on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online at siriusxm.com.
