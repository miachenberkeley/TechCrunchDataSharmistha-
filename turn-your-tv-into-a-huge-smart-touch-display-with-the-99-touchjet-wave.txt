Innovations on the good ol family television have movedfrom 3D to 4K to curved panel over the years. But what all of thoseevolutions have sharedare a heightened price tag for a whole new device.An Indiegogo campaign that launched yesterday is hoping to bring somecrazynew functionality toyour existing TVby way of a $99 device thatadds touch controls and othersmart featuresto your TV.The Touchjet WAVE allows you to control your television with your finger, a stylus or your smartphone, while also lettingyoudownload a host of apps directly to your TV.I recently met up with the team from Touchjetto try out the device, and while it was just a prototype, it was clear that the WAVEhad a ton of potential uses for users looking to upgrade their existing TVs.The device works much like those novelty laser keyboards in that it pretty simply puts a laser overlay on your TV that matches your touch input to the onscreen experience.One of the first questions I had about the WAVE was why? Its clear that Touchjet isnt aiming for everyone with itstouch capabilitybut it definitely also sees touch inputas the feature that really sets it apart.This feature isnt goingto be the new way you control your TV (Id definitely still rather be on the couch), but it does seemlike afun wayto play Fruit Ninja with the familyor a cool method of flippingthrough apresentation at work.The main thing to remember is that the pre-order price $99 isnt just for touch capability, youre also buying an Android PC that upgrades your TV to allow a host of apps that you can control from your smartphone, as well.At the time of writing, the WAVE has just blown past its $100K goal after only one day.
