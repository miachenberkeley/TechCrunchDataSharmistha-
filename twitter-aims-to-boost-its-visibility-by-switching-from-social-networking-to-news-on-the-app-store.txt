Following yet another quarter of sluggish user growth, Twitter has changed how its flagship mobile application is categorized on Apples iTunes App Store. Instead of competing against Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, Pinterest, and others in the crowded Social networking category, where Twitter had previously ranked inthe top 10, the company has moved its app tothe News category, where its now #1.The change has a two-fold effect. For starters, Twitter has been consistently ranked as a #5 application in Social Networking over the past several months  which is certainly nothing to be glum about  but ranking as the #1 app in a category could be better in terms of App Storevisibility.As users set up new iPhones for the first time by visiting various app categories, theyre likely to take a number one ranked application into heightened consideration.More importantly, becoming a number one ranked app could potentially impact Twitters Overall ranking, which would give it better visibility in the App Stores top Free appschart where Twitter is #28.The movealso puts Twittersapp in front of a different sort of audience  those who are looking for easier ways to keep up with news on their mobile device, rather than those who want to use another social network.That could also boost downloadsor at least Twitter hopes.The company has not commented publicly on the change at this time, nor has it made a similar move on Google Play. As of the time of writing, the Twitter app on Google Play continues to rank in the Social category.Its worth pointing out that non-traditional news applications do well on the App Stores News category, often even topping those from mainstream publishers like The WSJ, NY Times, NPR, and others.For example, Reddits newly launched iOS application is currently number two in News, just behind Twitter. Flipboards social magazine app is #13. And the category is easy for newcomers to break into with a good ranking, as well  just see the new CNN Politics app (#3) or theSkimms first native mobile effort (#5), for instance.Twitters switch comes at a time when the companys user growth has effectively flatlined. Although it grew a bit to reach 310 million monthly active users this past quarter, thats barely an increase from the 305 million in Q4 2015.Meanwhile, none of its prior efforts to revamp its product have seemingly paid off, including changes to how tweets are sorted in users timelines, the addition of polls, changing favorites to likes, or even the launch of a new product called Moments, which attempts to summarize the best of Twitter in a separate tab.This latter feature may be the most relevant with regard to Twitters new App Store category, as its focus is on curating the news that breaks on Twitter in an easy-to-follow format.According to third-party app intelligencefirmSensor Tower, Twitter made its category switch yesterday. The firm says Twittershould easily maintain its top ranking ahead of Reddit and CNN for the time being, while before it had been behind Messenger, Facebook and othersin the Social Networking category.That being said, it will take some time to see if this change in strategy will actually affect Twitters Overall ranking. For now, it has not. That implies, at least in this brief period of time, Twitters downloads have stayed the same despite the switch.
