Today was not a good day for tech stocks.Universally, tech stocks crashed today alongside everything else, erasing billions in value across the board, as part of a bad day overall for the market. Theres not a whole lot of confidence throughout themarket, but tech  even bellwethers likeApple  werent safe today.That being said, some stocks got particularly hammered as part of a continued downward trend  like Fitbit, which is trying to get into the smartwatch market, and GoPro, which just laid off a ton of people.This is not a good sign for technology companies, which need their stocks to perform well if theyre going to continue attracting talent with compensation packages that also include shares and keep activist investors off their backs. For some of the companies seeing poor performance lately, a continuously droppingstock price  like in the case of Twitter or Fitbit  can make those companies attractive acquisition targets.Heres how acouple of stocks fared:And thats just to name a few. But the standout here is clearly Twitter, which has had a continued march south for the past month or so, bringing it to continuous all-time lows. Twitter is facing a lot of challenges with its core business. While its revenue growth doesnt seem to be a massive problem for the company, it has togrowits user base in order to continue expanding its business  something its had serious problems with for some time.Does this make Twitter look like a healthy target for a larger company to snap up? Perhaps. Any larger company, by buying Twitter, would be pickinga relatively healthy advertising business and a large platform with a huge reach beyond monthly active users.For all of these companies, fluctuations with the rest of the market can be a common occurrence. But that doesnt make it any less significant for the employees at those companies carefully paying attention to how their net worth  a chunk of which is often locked up in shares  flows (this time south) with their employers worth in the public markets eyes.
