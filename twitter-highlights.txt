If keeping up with all those tweets is starting to feel a little overwhelming, Twitter just announced a new feature that could help  at least if you own an Android phone.Earlier this year, it launched While You Were Away, which can put older, popular tweets at the top of your feed. The theme here is helping users find relevant content even if its not the most recent thing posted  something that could help the service seem less intimidating to casual users.Twitter says Highlights, on the other hand, will provide a fast and simple summary of Twitter. Youll get a notification up twice a day, which will bring you to the new Highlights section in your app. Once there, you can browse popular tweets from people you know and trending stories, and when youre done, close Highlights and move back to the main feed.Introducing Highlights.
