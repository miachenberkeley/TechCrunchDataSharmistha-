According to remarks made by Twitters CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday, it seems as ifTwitter may be reversing its earlier decision to banPolitwoops, aservice that tracked politicians deleted tweets, holding them accountable for things they wished they hadnt saidon the micro-blogging service. Developed by the Open State Foundation,Politwoops operated dedicated accounts in 30 countries around the world prior to Twitters ban, including one in the U.S. run by a government transparency group called the Sunlight Foundation.In May, Twitter banned the U.S. version ofPolitwoops, thenproceeded to shut down the remaining countries later this summer, saying that the service violated Twitters developer agreement, and that everyone on Twitter should have the same rights to privacyeven politicians.The move, naturally, was lambasted by a group of 17international human rights and transparency groups, including the Sunlight Foundation, EFF, Free Press, Open State Foundation, Human Rights Watch, and others, who reminded Twitter that what politicians say is a matter of public record.Additionally, the groups pointed out in an open letter to Twitter,thecourts have long upheld this same opinion, and that citizens rights to information should outweigh an officials right to a retroactive edit, as they put it.The decision to ban Politwoops painted Twitter in a bad light. It made it clearthatthe company cared more about keeping high-profile users  like politicians and diplomats  onits service, rather than supporting the efforts of organizations advocating government transparency.In addition, the ban was indicative of how poorly Twitter treated its developer community.Even though Twitter has the right to enforce its terms as it sees fit, the ban was enacted with very little discussion between Twitter and the affectedorganizations. Twitter also didnt give the groups a way to appeal or discuss the situation further.Now under co-founder Dorseys leadership, Twitter is trying to mend relationswith its developers. Dorsey even apologized to developers yesterday, and referenced some of the companys more controversial decisions  including the shutdown of Politwoops.We want to come to you today, and first and foremost apologize for the confusion, Dorsey said, speaking at Twitters second annual developer conference, Flight. We have a responsibility to continue to power organizations who want to bring transparency like Politwoops, he added.Ironically, despite Twitters promise of improved dialog between third-party developers and the company, the CEOs comments caught the Open State Foundation by surprise, as there hadnt yet been direct talks with Twitter, were told.Remarked Open States Director Arjan El Fassed, upon hearing the news, this statement seems to indicate a possible change in Twitters position on Politwoops. We look forward to reach [sic] out to Twitter and restore access to Twitters API again so that we can continue to enable the public to hold elected public officials accountable for their public statements, he said.Meanwhile, the U.S.-based Sunlight Foundation had a similar reaction.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey today acknowledged his companys responsibility to empower organizations that advocate for transparency and accountability in government, and specifically cited Politwoops, said Sunlight Foundation President Chris Gates. We look forward to rebooting the dialogue with Twitter about how it can play an active role in promoting openness and transparency around the world.In other words, instead of speaking to groups directly or allowing them to regain API access, Twitter so far has onlymade vague statements about its past mistakes.The Sunlight Foundation confirmed to us that the Politwoops mention was indeed a surprise, and their only heads up was a note from Twitterto tune into Flight. There have not yet been conversations between Twitter and the organization. However, aSunlight Foundation spokesperson says that theres no reason to dwell on what happened and that the bottom line is that theorganization is both surprised and grateful for the opportunity to re-open discussions.During its time online, Politwoops didnt break any major scandals, beyond one notable incident where politicians were caught deleting praise forBowe Bergdahl, a soldier held hostage in Afghanistan, who was later charged with desertion.But given the heated campaigning going on now in the U.S. presidential race, Politwoops could have served a valuable role  perhaps catching things like Donald Trumps removal of a controversial 9/11 tweet from 2013 which read, Iwould like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th. While this particular incident was spottedby the press, an automated service could increase the chances that this and other manipulations could beuncovered, too.Twitter has so far not responded for further requests for comment. Update, Twitter responded on Friday by pointing to the Sunlight Foundations statement. As of the time of writing, the Sunlight Foundations Politwoops website remains online but non-functional.
