It doesnt happen that often anymore (thats the real story!), but Twitter.com is down. For the count. As of the time of publishing, its been down for about 45 minutes. Weve checked Twitters status page on Tumblr, but theres nothing there. Weve also reached out to Twitter for comment and will update you once we hear back.Twitters mobile apps and Tweetdeck seem unaffected, so go ahead and tweet your heads off from your non-desktop non-web browser device setups. Any downtime for a real-time service like Twitter is a disruption, especially because a lot of news breaks on the platform, so this outage is almost like landlines with no dial tones.Dont worry. Monday is a pain in the ass for all of us, Twitter.Let me take this opportunity to once again pine for the days of the fail whale (design, not downtime)UPDATE: The desktop version is up and down with some parts of the sites still showing that its down. No word as to what happened, but well update if we hear something.UPDATE 2: Its back.
