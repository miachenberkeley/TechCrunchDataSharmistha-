For years, Twitter users have complained about the fact that link and photo URLs count against each tweets 140-character limit. Now that may finally change. According to a report in Bloomberg, Twitter will stop including photos and links in character counts soon, possibly within the next two weeks.URLs are automatically shortened by Twitter, but still eat up 23 characters. The platform has exploredways to make it easier to include links in tweets since 2010, when its t.co link wrapping service launched, but many users dont think they should be counted at all.Twitter declined to comment on the report.If the new character count policy is implemented, it will allow people to compose wordier tweetsbut still be far less drastic than another change that Twitter reportedly deliberated earlier this year, which would have raised its limit to thousands of characters.CEO Jack Dorsey said that the time that Twitter is not going to be shy about building more utility and power into Twitter for people. As long as its consistent with what people want to do, were going to explore it.Twitter has been encouraging users to include more media in their tweets with features like support for videos, gifs, and polls. What theyreally want, however, is space to write more.Usershave resorted to tweetstorms (which wont work as well and may become downright incomprehensible now that Twitter is moving from a chronological to algorithmic timeline) and screenshots of text.The ability to jam more text, media, links, and other content into individual tweets was the point of Twitter Cards, which launched four years agoin a bid to attract more brands, media companies, advertisers, and other power users to the platform.By giving userseven those that dont use Twitter cardsmore control over how they compose their tweets, Twitter may be able to lure more people onto the sitewhich is important because the companys user growth has stagnated, while other social networks and messengers like Snapchat and WhatsApp continue to gaintraction.User engagementespecially during live eventsmay also increase because people no longer have to perform mental gymnastics in order to compose the shortest tweets possible and can instead use more conversationallanguage.
