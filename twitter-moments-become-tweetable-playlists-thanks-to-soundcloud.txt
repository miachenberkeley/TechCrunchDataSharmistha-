An upgrade toTwitters Moments feature, originally designed to offer users a curated best of Twitter experience, now turns Moments into a source for tweetable playlists. Through an ongoing partnership with music streaming service SoundCloud, Twitter Moments will now allow curators to create and share Moments containing SoundClouds audio cards  that is, music tracks embedded in a tweet. Its too bad you cant use this feature for yourself, though.To be clear, SoundClouds audio cards hadbeen available for playing within Twitters timeline since 2014. But they had not yet worked within the Twitter Moments feature. The cards are a special format that lets curators attach music or any other audio content to a tweet. Then, when a user clicks on the play button in the tweet, the content simply starts streaming.By allowing audio cards in Moments, curators can put together groups of audio-enabled tweets, making for a tweetable playlist of sorts.This is a clever new addition for Twitter, which in the past struggled with its music ambitions. Though an ideal platform for following conversations around topics, including music, Twitters standalone Music app failed to deliver the sort of experience that could attract mainstream users to its platform. The app forced users to follow artists in order topower its music recommendations, but doing so could clutter up your Twitter feed in unwelcome ways. (Its one thing to like Kanyes music, but quite another to subject yourself to his tweets.)The app had other challenges as well,including a larger failure to tap into the ongoingconversations and social sharing that makes the service worthwhile.Playlists-turned-Twitter-Moments seemmuch moreinteresting and engaging than the Twitter Music app once was, but at launch itsuffers from a huge setback: not everyone can create Twitter Moments.Thats because only Twitter and select partners are allowed to craft these Moments, instead of the general user base.Boo, hiss.When Moments debuted, Twitter announced partners likeBleacher Report, Buzzfeed, Entertainment Weekly, Fox News, Getty Images, Mashable, MLB, NASA, New York Times, Vogue and the Washington Post would be building these mini-tweet collections for the platform.With the addition of SoundCloud support in Moments, curators includingStereogum and Vices Thump are first to takeadvantage of the new feature, which lets themtap into SoundClouds database of 125 million tracks.Twitter is missing a huge opportunityby keeping Moments editorially curated instead of a tool for its user base, and this SoundCloud integration is yet another example.TheTwitter Moments feature in the app could easilycontinue to display whatever Twitter deems best, while still allowing everyday users to craft Twitter Moments of their own. After all, Twitter users are already hacking their way into creating tweet stories by way of tweetstorms. Why shouldnt they be able to put together multimedia stories as well, or a list of their favorite songs?An easy-to-use front end for building a music-powered Moment, combined with integrations withtop streaming services like SoundCloud, as well as Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, oreven YouTube, could be a huge draw among the mainstream who have yet to see a need for Twitter, as well as increase engagement from lapsed or casual users.Of course, dedicated apps like 8tracks already allow for this kind of mixtape-building experience, but itsdifficult to get a large audienceto explore the world of niche applications. (8tracks is combating this problem by raising funds directly from its community instead of VCs, in fact.)You can explore Twitters new SoundCloud-powered playlists in Twitter Moments starting today.If only you could make your own.Stereogums favorite songs right now//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
