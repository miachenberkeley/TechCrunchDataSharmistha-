Twitter has introduced auto-playing video and animated GIFs to its official timelines in both the iOS application and on the web, with support for the feature coming to the Android app soon. The feature means that youll see native video uploaded directly to Twitter, Vines and GIFs uploaded to the service playback instantly as you scroll  similar to how video works on Facebook.This is a feature that has been in testing with select users previously, but now its going to be ineffect across the service for all users. Twitter is framing this as a way to keep users more informed, making them less likely to miss out on the action, while also acknowledging that its also a way to boost the advertising value of its platform.Twitters President of Global Revenue Adam Bain explained via tweets that advertisers are only charged when a video is 100 percent in view in a users feed, so when the top or bottom is cut off the view doesnt count. Twitters advertising blog elaborates that it also only charges advertisers when the video has been viewed for at least 3 seconds, provided again that it isnt cut off in some way in the viewers feed.According to Bain, this qualifies Twitter video as among the best values in online video advertising in terms of the quality of what it defines as a view.We believe this makes a Twitter Promoted Video campaign one of the highest quality views, if not THE highest quality video view in industry adam bain (@adambain) June 16, 2015Autoplaying video is muted, which users will no doubt appreciate, and theres even an option in settings to disable it (though its enabled by default). Clicking on any video changes to a full screen view of the content in question and unmutes the sound. Twitter is also offering an option to only autoplay over Wi-Fi to respect user data limits, and will automatically default to the old, click-to-play way of doing things for users in areas where theres typically lower bandwidth allowances, or more expensive fees for data usage.Itll be interesting to see how users react to these changes; Facebooks introduction of the same didnt appear to cause any significant revolts, but Twitter is a different beast, and I could definitely see this getting a bit noisy depending on the size and makeup of a users follow group.
