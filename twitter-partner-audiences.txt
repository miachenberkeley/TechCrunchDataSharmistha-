Twitter announced a new ad-targeting feature today called partner audiences, allowing Twitter advertisers to aim their ads at audiences like coffee buyers and cereal buyers.The various social media platforms have done a lot of work to expand their ad programs beyond their core sites and apps, but of course its useful for data to flow in the direction, too, with information from the rest of the web improving targeting on Facebook, Twitter, and so on  with Twitter already allowing advertisers to target ads at people who visited their website or used their app.In this case, Twitters partnering with Acxiom and Datalogix. (Twitter previously partnered with Datalogix to track when tweets actually drove offline sales.) Using their data, advertisers will be able to target what Twitter says are more than 1,000 possible audiences.In  a blog post announcing the feature, the company writes:For example, by using a partner to provide the desired audience, an auto brand can connect with audiences that are in-market for a new car. A CPG company can reach customers that have previously purchased products in their category. And luxury brands can limit campaigns to shoppers who earn a household income above a certain threshold.Oh, and if you dont want to be targeted in this way, you can go to you privacy settings and uncheck the box that says Tailor ads based on information shared by ad partners.
