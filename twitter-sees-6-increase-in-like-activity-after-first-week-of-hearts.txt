Speaking at the Open Mobile Summit in San Francisco today, Twitters SVP of Product, Kevin Weil, shared with the crowd that the new hearts arent stopping activity.In fact, the activity is increased:"With the change from favorites to likes we've seen a 6% increase in like activity in just the first week." @kevinweil Robi Ganguly (@rganguly) November 10, 2015.@kevinweil says that people are Liking () 6% more than they were favoriting () on Twitter. Easier to understand, he says. Kurt Wagner (@KurtWagner8) November 10, 2015The reason? According to Weil, Its easier to understand. Makes sense. How many favorites could you really have at the end of the day? The increase is 6% for existing users and 9% for new users.We put a lot of thought into a change as fundamental as replacing star with heart. We tested it a bunch of different ways across a bunch of different countries. Trying different icons, different words. Weil said.The heart is a universal symbol. Its a much more inclusive symbol. Weil continued.Maybe people do like hearts more, after all. But the argument against them makes absolute sense. Its very difficult to get people to think and act one way and then swap out the meaning just like that. Lets just hope they dont change it againor put the icon up for bidding by advertisers.Weils talk was streamed on Periscope, if youd like to go relive it (or fast-forward or rewind, thanks to Periscopes new web and Android functionality):LIVE on #Periscope: Tune in! @KevinWeil keynoting Open Mobile Summit.
