Providing proof that markets are silly, shares of Twitter stock are up around 5percent today following news that Jack Dorsey will again be its CEO. Dorsey will retain his role at Square, making him a rare double executive.Heres the chart:This means two things. First that the markets are apparently at least modestly surprised at news that was functional truth inside the technology world for some time. And, that investors are content with Dorseys return.The tale of his prior exit is now the stuff of rumorsund drang, but that is, apparently for now, water under an upstream bridge.According to Google Finance, Twitter is now worth $17.79 billion, implying a market cap spike of just around a billion dollars, depending on the most recent fluctuation in the firms share price. A billion dollars is a meaningful increase in the value of Twitter, which has enduredviolent share-price swings.Now its work time. Dorsey must prove that he can expand Twitters user base. Newly appointed COO Adam Bain has been masterful at building the social firms core business. Other executives have, to date, failed to grow Twitters user base at a respectable clip. You can only go back to the same well so many times; thus, Dorseys task is clear.For now, investors are happy. Well see where things stand during earnings.
