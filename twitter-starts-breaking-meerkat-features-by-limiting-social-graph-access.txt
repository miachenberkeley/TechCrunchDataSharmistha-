Talk about timing: Twitter confirms theyve bought Meerkat-competitor Periscope, and but a few hours later Twitter makes a move that kills off a few Meerkat features.Meerkat is a fast-rising, Twitter-centric live video broadcasting platform that seems to be gaining quite the fanbase since launching just a few weeks back. Viewers of your livestream can tweet at you and have those tweets appear on your screen, allowing for quick, on-the-fly interaction and discussion.Much of Meerkats success and draw lays in its tight integration with Twitter  something that many have noted could be an issue moving forward, be it that Twitter decides to get into live video themselves. Which, of course, theyve just done.And now Twitter has begun to cut off off Meerkats access to Twitters social graph.So whats that mean? Until now, new Meerkat users could login to the service with their Twitter account, and bam  youd automatically be following anyone on Meerkat who you already follow on Twitter, and theyd be following you back. It let Meerkat seem like a very, very natural extension of Twitter.Buzzfeed spotted the change first, when follower counts seemed to be a bit off when creating new accounts.Weve reached out to Twitter, who confirmed the change. Heres what a Twitter spokesperson would say on the matter:We are limiting their access to Twitters social graph, consistent with our internal policy. Their users will still be able to distribute videos on Twitter and login with their Twitter credentials.Is it a devastating change? Maybe not  Meerkat already has a fair amount of momentum behind it. But its certainly not something the Meerkat team will be excited about particularly with the now present threat of an in-house-Twitter competitor looming.Update: Meerkat co-founder Ben Rubin responds, calling the move a sad day for the Twitter developer community but a small bump for meerkat:
