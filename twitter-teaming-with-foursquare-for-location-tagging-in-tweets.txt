Were working with @foursquare so you can tag specific locations in Tweets: https://t.co/MwlLz5Pfvq pic.twitter.com/jATzXvbuV6 Twitter (@twitter) March 23, 2015Previously, location services in Twitter worked by detecting your coordinates based on your device sensors and assigning a spot based on those parameters. Now, users will be able to tap the location button to get a list of nearby suggested places so that they can ID a very specific spot, like the poutinerie in the example above (which, coincidentally, is why Im the very best person to report this news).Twitter was rumored to be in talks with Foursquare regarding a partnership to do exactly this late last year, when Business Insider reported the geolocation services would arrive sometime as early as the first quarter of 2015.Location based tweets could do a lot to help Twitter extend its monetization and advertising options, as well as help onboard new users by providing them with location-relevant Tweets before they build their own timeline. The company describes the features in detail over at its Support website.
