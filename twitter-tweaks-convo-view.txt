Amid the noiseof Apples annual WWDC keynote yesterday, Twitterposted a note about a new tweak its made to the conversation view of tweets that suggests its doing (yet) more algorithmic ordering of the content on its network. The new feature started rolling out yesterday.Last year the companyconfirmed the launch of a more algorithmic timeline intentionallydiluting the human-powered curation that otherwisedefines the network and allowsTwitter users tobe exposed to a greater breadth of content vs other more tightly controlled social services likeFacebook.Twitters motivations in adulterating the information itsusers see with algorithmically selectedcontent is typically attributed to its problems growing usage  so an attempt to tweak its service so itpresentsa more enticing on-ramp for newbies. Of course long time Twitter users have created plentiful value in the service themselves, so we dont appreciate this pesky meddling.Since then Twitterhas continued to take steps to control and shape what its users see, launching a while you were away recap feature at the end of last year, which dumps a selection of tweets its algorithms think youd have likedat the top of your timeline. Again, that can be characterized as an attempt to do some of the legwork for users andsurface that elusive interesting stuff.This Aprilit also tooksteps to limit the spread of abuse and violent threats on its platform  testing a pre-emptive, anti-abuse filter that automaticallyidentifies abusive tweets and limits their reach. Thats a delicate balancing act for a company that has historically taken a robust pro-free speech position, yet at times appeared to be on the back foot when its platform has been appropriated by co-ordinated hate groups and used as a tool for sustainedharassment.Making tweets appear more engagingThe latest tweak is to the conversation view that can spring up around individual tweets when other users engage with them by directly replying to the tweet.Twitter is now ordering what would otherwise have been a sequential series of responses  and is again basing its algorithmically controlled hierarchies on an amorphous notion of interestingness.Explaining the new feature in a blog post, Twitter product manager Akarshan Kumar writes:Conversations surrounding a Tweet, particularly if theyve sparked lots of replies and disparate conversations, can be hard to follow. So, were doing a few things to make this much easier: grouping conversations together and highlighting some of the most interesting exchanges surrounding a given Tweet right below that Tweet. To surface some of the most interesting conversations, well take factors into account like whether the original account has replied.With this tweak, the thin blue conversation line that caused such controversy when Twitter started threading it through connected tweets, back in 2013,again with the aim of making it easier to follow when users were directly@ing each other, now appears to be taking precedenceover and above individual replies to tweets. So a singular response to a tweet that goes unremarked on by the original tweeter is likely to be pushedlower down the ladder of tweet responses and displayed below more engaged responses.For example, here are the first few responses to a tweet recently sent by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron:In fact the first four grouped responses are nested threaded conversations where Twitter users have engaged with each other in response tothe original tweet (although Cameron himself has not chipped in). Individual responses that did not garner any other reactions are generally pushed lower down the info hierarchy. Although its not as simple as all conversations being displayed aboveall individual responses.Its not clear what other signals Twitter is using to algorithmically determine which responses should begiven display priority. Weve asked Twitter for more details on how this sorting works and will update this story with any response.Camerons tweets often elicit a high level of abusive responses andnegative sentiment still abounds in the above tweet conversation example, albeit you have to scroll quite far down to encounter the favored Cameron hater insult dishface. (And, curiously enough thephrase fuck off dishfaceappears entirelyabsent, which may be down to Twitters earlier attempts to quellabusive trolling.)As with other Twitter tweaks, the company notes it will continuallybe iterating and improving the new feature  saying its overall aim is to make it easier to understand and participate in conversations on Twitter as well as to find the best, most relevant content we have to offer.
