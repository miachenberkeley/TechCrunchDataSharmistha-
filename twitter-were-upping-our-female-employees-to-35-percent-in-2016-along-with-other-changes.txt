Like a lot of tech companies in Silicon Valley, Twitter last year published numbers about the different backgrounds and cultures of its employees, and its numbers were revealed to be rather white and very male.Specifically, as of last July, 70 percent of its employees weremen, and 72 percent of its managers were white.Mother Jones called the numbers embarrassing. Twitter apparently agrees. According to a newly published post by the company, Twitter is committed to making its U.S. workforce more diverse by the end of 2016.First, its tackling its male-to-female ratio imbalance, saying it plans toincreasethe number of itsfemale employees to 35 percent (up from 30 percent last year); increasewomen in tech roles to 16 percent (up from 10 percent);and ensure the percentage ofwomen in leadership roles hits25 percent (up from 21 percent).No, thats not 50-50, but remember, were talking about the span of a couple of years here.Twitteris also promising to increase the number of underrepresented minorities that it employs, with the goal of bumpingtheir numbers to 11 percent overall (up from 7 percent last year), to 9 percent in tech roles (up from 3 percent) and to 6 percent in leadership roles (up from 4 percent).Again, this may elicit groans. Well admit were not that excited about that 6 percent number in particular. But again, progress takes time.Its also worth noting that the U.S. is changing quicklybut is still mostly white, according to the latest U.S. government data.Hispanics make up 16percent of the rest of the population; African-Americans makeup 13 percent; Asiansrepresent 6 percent; and other racial and ethnic groups combined make up2percent.Itll be a very different picture by 2060, according to the latest Census Bureau projections. By then, minorities will account for 57percentof the U.S. population.Twitter says it wants the makeup of the company toreflect the vast range of people who use Twitter. Toward that end, its immediate diversity goals arent just good for public relations;theyre necessary if the company wants to thrive well into the future.
