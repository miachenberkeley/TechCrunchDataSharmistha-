Now that we can see that the custom emojis on Twitter are an ad unit, there are a few more interesting things to point out about the campaign with Coke.It appears that the company has leveraged stars of its acquired video platform, Vine, with a lot of them tweeting/vining to their vast number of followers about it. The campaign, while a bit murky, seems to be an attempt to break a goofy (probably non-existent) world record:Ready for some fun? Tweet #ShareaCoke to help set a new @RecordSetter record for the world's largest cheers. *clink!* pic.twitter.com/9UmY5WrVKE Twitter (@twitter) September 17, 2015Here are some Viners:.@Cody and I are going to get #ShareaCoke trending today, trying to break the record for largest cheers!

Or any other campaign. The custom emojis are just native contentalbeit cooler than other native content we get thrown in our faces. Plus, I dont think theres going to be an EmojiAd blocker anytime soon.@drew  Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) September 17, 2015This particular campaign is also something driven by Niche, the company Twitter acquired earlier this year. The team is now a part of the brand strategy group at Twitter. That companys focus was to put advertisers in touch with social media celebrities. Lots of moving parts here, all in-house though for Twitter. Which is huge. All we need now is some Periscope action and this one will go down as a run of network campaign. I mean, they just launched web profiles, so Im sure theyre collecting who their big stars will and could be.Is it working? I suppose. The #ShareACoke hashtag has been a worldwide trending topic for the past few hours. Its actually nice to see that Coke didnt also buy the top trending ad position, they let this one bubble up organically. I mean, as organically as it can be with paid celebs tweeting about it.Twitter + Vine + Niche = Happy #BrandsIn other words, the ad group is firing on all cylinders with this one.
