I was hoping to share some of the final bits of the Twitter Flight conference with you from my front row seat live and in beautiful mobile color, but was unable to. Seems like Periscope is having a bit of an issue right now thats not letting anyone stream. Sucky timing, for sure.Sorry. Were having service interruption issues. Were working on it!!

Apologies for the inconvenience! Periscope Help (@periscopehelp) October 21, 2015Twitter was using Periscope to show backstage footage before CEO Jack Dorsey took the stage and perhaps that rocked the house so much it went down. To be fair, it was a 2 hour keynote (that might have gone a bit long, not sure) and if anyone was trying to stream all of it they should learn what livestreaming is all about.LIVE on #Periscope: #TwitterFlight with @jack https://t.co/lCAw4ONua5 TwitterDev (@TwitterDev) October 21, 2015Its been down for well over 50 minutes and well update you when we hear more. Luckily theres a lot of developers around today at the conference, so Im sure theyll get everything going again.UPDATE: Theyre back!Service should be returned to normal! We found the problem  pic.twitter.com/KIeaBhjUgN Periscope Help (@periscopehelp) October 21, 2015Just picture my Periscope from the end of the keynote being ridiculously awesome. I mean, it wouldve been wobbly but hey, gimme a break.
