Twitter is announcing a new conversational ad unit today, where users are prompted topersonalize and share a marketers message.These ads are similar to Twitters existing Promoted Tweets, but with a key difference  the tweet is morelike a poll question, where users can weigh in by choosing from multiple hashtags.Afterthey hit one of the call-to-action buttons in the ad, theyll be presented withan automated tweet featuring their chosen hashtag (as well as the marketers photo or video), which they canthen personalize. Afterwards, theyget a message from the brand thanking them for their participation.For example, Samsung Canada ran an ad with the message, Its Sunday, and you have no plans. Is it #TimeToStay or #TimeToGo? while Lifetime asked Who won the battle, #HighlandsVoices or #StayTuned? VOTE before the premiere of #PitchSlapped Jan 5th at 10/9c!The conversational ads seem like a more effective way to encourage participation, though. Theres an element of interactivity youre not justrandomly sharing a marketers tweet, youre also adding your own touch, if only in a small way.For better or for worse, this may mean that youre about to see more users sharing marketing content with their followers. Thats good for advertisers, of course  as Twitter writes:Each shared Tweet is powerful because it drives earned media for the brand at no extra cost, resulting in higher ROI. Additionally, research has shown that organic conversation about a brand delivers significant value for advertisers.
