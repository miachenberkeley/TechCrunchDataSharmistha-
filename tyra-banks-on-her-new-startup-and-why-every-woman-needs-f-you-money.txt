Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) October 20, 2015Banks, who wore a T-shirt with the words Im an entrepreneur, bitch. is winding down her Top Model show to focus more on her other business ventures and advised more women to reach out to mentors.Banks said she started her journey into tech with a failed smizing app (it basically made you look like you were smiling with your eyes but had the unfortunate effect of making users look like aliens). Banks said she learned from that experience and that one of the better things she has done was cold-call potential advisers like Tony Hsieh from Zappos.@tyrabanks at #WSJDLive speaking to @jkrim about empowering female entrepreneurs pic.twitter.com/vUtHOYk6G2 Yun-Hee Kim (@yunheekim22) October 20, 2015The original Victorias Secret model self-funded her beauty startupbut disclosed onstage shed be seeking outside investment for it in the future.
