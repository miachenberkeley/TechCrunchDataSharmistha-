In a big win for Uber in London, the U.K. High Court has ruled that itsuse of a smartphone app does not constitute a taximeter  so is not breaking the law on this specific technical point.Taximeters enabletaxis to vary their fare in real-time, based on traffic conditions.The ruling is the culmination of a long running battle between drivers of Londons more highly regulated black cabs and app-based on-demand ride hailing incomer, which claims to have more than a million users in the U.K. capital now.London taxishave more onerous regulatory requirements, such as passing a knowledge test of Londons streets, than private hire vehicles (the category under which Uber falls). And cabdrivers argue thatUbers smartphone app is the equivalent of a taximeter for calculating fares  which its illegal for PHVsto have.However the judge, Mr Justice Ouseley, clearly disagreed with thisargument. In my judgment, these PHVs are not equipped with a taximeter as defined by section 11(3), he writes in the ruling. The drivers Smartphone with the Drivers App is not a device for calculating fares by itself or in conjunction with Server 2, and even if it were, the vehicle is not equipped with it. I reach that conclusion as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the words as applied to the agreed facts.He concludesjudgment with the declaration that:A taximeter, for the purposes of Section 11 of the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act 1998, does not include a device that receives GPS signals in the course of a journey, and forwards GPS data to a server located outside of the vehicle, which server calculates a fare that is partially or wholly determined by reference to distance travelled and time taken, and sends the fare information back to the device.Transport for London (TfL), the local government body which regulatedthe operation of taxis and PHVs in London, had previously said it did not believe Ubers use of smartphones was equivalent to a taximeter  but had deferred the final decision to the High Court.Another regulatory advantage of being certified as anofficial London taxi is being legally allowed to pick up fares from anywhere  a perk offered to black cabsto off-set the regulatory requirements they have to meet.However Ubersuse of a location-pinpointingapp thatmatches drivers with passengers in real-time effectively enablesthe company to pick up fares from anywhere further fueling London cabbies grievances regarding the service.Todays High Court ruling pertains specifically to the taximeter point  and is effectively only a ruling on the technical definition of what constitutes ataximeter under current TfL taxi regulationrules. However Uber is clearly hoping it can use the ruling togenerate wider momentum in its favor.Responding to todays High Court ruling in a blog postUber dubbed it a victory for common sense.We understand that black cab drivers are feeling the pressure from services like Uber. But the answer is to reduce todays burdensome regulations on cabbies  not introduce new regulations on an entire industry, it said.TfL is currently running a separate consultationfor proposals to changes to existing regulationsfor PHVs  with suggestions such as a mandatory five-minute wait before theycan pick up passengers, to try to ensure a level playing field between taxis and tech-powered taxi competitorslike Uber.Following todays High Court ruling, Uber reiterated its condemnation ofTfLs proposals, dubbing them nonsensical, and arguing:They will be bad for riders  making the experience slower and the app clunkier to use; bad for drivers  limiting their choices; and bad for London  restricting the ability of everyone to share a ride across town.Lets hope todays High Court decision in favour of new technology leads to TfL shelving their nonsensical new rules, it added.The company has clashed with local regulators in markets around the world. (Its a sure-fire sign a startupis scoring aboveaverage in the disruption stakeswhen theres an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to the legal status of itsservice in different global markets) However in London itis facing a swathe of restrictions on its operations if all theTfL proposals rule changes come to pass. (Although its worth stressing that TfL is running a consultation on those proposals, so no rule changes have been decided at this point.)Writing in the Telegraph newspaper earlier this month  in response to being petitioned by Uber users galvanized by the companyinto objectingon its behalf to theproposed rulechanges  Londons mayor, Boris Johnson, voiced somesupport for cabbies grievances, arguing that: At present that law is being systematically broken  or at least circumvented  by the use of the Uber app.He went on to call for a balance that allows a coexistence, between a premium black cab service, and minicab apps that have become a boon to so many.Until Parliament has the guts to change the law we must uphold the existing and long-standing legal distinctions between black cabs and minicabs, Johnsonadded.This month local Uber app-based rival (and U.K. startup) Hailo handed back its PHV licence to return to being a black cab only ride-hailing service with the aim ofdifferentiating vs Uber et al by positioningitself as a premium alternative.As a society, we put value on things above and beyond just purely a race to the bottom and doing things as cheaply as possible, argued CEO Andrew Pinnington, discussing Hailosshift in gears with TechCrunch earlier this month. That might be accessibility, that might be safety and reliability, it might be service. Its not necessarily all about price.Responding in a statement to the High Court ruling today, Pinnington added: We are clear that the sector needs to work together and put forward a bold vision for the role of black cabs across London, and this involves a level playing field  this means no pick and mix on regulations and basic common standards across both sectors.Also responding to the ruling today, U.K. minicab price comparison app Kabbee  another Uber rival said the ruling on thetaximeter point is a welcome clarification for players in the market, albeit one that has been a long time coming.Now all licensed minicab fleets have the right to use in-car meters which will mean more competition and better consumer choice  its a positive step, Kabbeesaid in a statement.However it added that the ruling does not address remaining inconsistencies pertaining to Ubers operations  pointing to issues such as Uber not requesting a destination address from passengers, and questions over payment of VAT and how it pays drivers.For its part Uber generally argues that the answer to technological disruption of regulations is to loosen the rules governingtaxis rather than tightening the screw on rivalsuse ofnew technologies. But there is little doubt Ubers very well funded business has benefited  and continues to benefit  fromusing technology tocircumvent regulations in the interim, i.e.beforeregulators have caught up with tech developments and figured out how best to respond to them.
