While there hasbeen high profileU.K. government backing for furnishingthe nations youth with digital skills in recent years, including a requirement in the English national curriculum to start teaching coding to primary age children,new research from comms industry regulator Ofcom suggests a parallel push to teach kids to be much better critical thinkersin ourinformation-overloaded era is also desperately needed.As it stands, a growing segment of thenations youthis fartoocredulous when it comes to the media they are consuming online, with OfcomfindingthatBritish kids sometimes lack the understanding to decide whether the digital content they are viewing is true or impartial.Itslatest media use and attitudes report, which surveyedtheviews of U.K. children and parents in 2015, charts a rise in trust in online information among kids, with nearly one in ten of eight- to 15-year-oldsapparently believing the information they encounter onsocial media websites andapps is all true  a doubling of the rate from last years report.In one sense this is hardly surprising, in anera of increasingly blurred lines dividing editorial content frommarketing and advertising. Not to mentionthe systematicappropriation of user generated content by the likes of giant ad-powered social media platform businesses, such as Facebook, to use asa trusted backdrop in order to dripfeed advertising to users.But all the more reason, then, to teach kids to be more critical about the digital information they are being fed. Not that this is somethingthegovernment appears to be prioritizing. Rather it continues to focus attention onthe needs of digital businesses, such as fundingfree online courses teaching the kind of skillstech employers seeksuch associal mediamarketing training. Media literacy? Not so much.Incredibly Ofcoms research found that one in five online teens (twelve- to fifteen-year-olds) believe information returned by a search engine such as Google or Bing must be true. Yetonly a thirdare able to identify paid-for adverts within these search results.Ofcom alsofound that U.K. kids are increasingly turning to YouTube  another platform owned by ad giant Google  to seek out true and accurate information about the goings on in the world. Nearly one in ten (eight per cent) of online kids identified YouTube as their preferred choice for this kind of info, up from just three per cent in 2014.Yet only half of the 12- to 15-year-olds who watch YouTube are aware that advertising is the main source of funding on the site, and just under half are aware that video bloggers can be paid to endorse products or services.Truly we are livingina golden age formarketing and misinformation.The research also suggeststhe nations youth is generally becoming morecomfortable with the notion of sharing personal information online  again, hardly a surprise given how they are being groomed to do so by the social media platforms that rely on user generated content to power their businesses.Ofcom foundthat fewer teens than last years studywould not want anyone to see their content details; location; info about what they are doing; and photos and videos from being our with their friends.That said, the research also foundteens are increasingly statingthey want this type of personal information sharing to be withtheir friends only  suggesting growth of amore nuanced position on privacy, such as perhaps kids preferring the more bounded info sharing enabledbymessaging apps, for instance, vs the broader social sharing platforms where their parents may also be present.The full Ofcom media use and attitudesreport can be found here.
