A long-awaited independent review of U.K. government surveillance capabilities, conducted by QC David Anderson and published today, has recommended that interception warrants should be signed off by the judiciary, rather than government ministers.And while the review generally supports U.K. intelligence agencies having bulk interception and data retention (aka mass surveillance) capabilities  which stands in contrast to the U.S. Senates recent rowing back on this front in the USA Freedom Act  Anderson stresses these powers should be subject to strict additional safeguards, such as having judges sign off interception warrants.Thereviewrecommends a new body, called the Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission (ISIC), be set upto judicially authorize all interception warrants.Other safeguards recommended in the report are tighter definitions of the purposes for which data is sought  with Anderson specifyingit should bedefined by operationsor mission purposes (as opposed to fishing expeditions); and the introduction of a new form of bulk warrant to limit the acquisition of data captured via mass surveillance to comms metadata.The 300+-page reportalso calls for a new legislative framework to coverinvestigatory powers  mirroring calls earlier this year from the U.K. parliaments Intelligence and Security Committee, which also recommended there be a new single act of parliament to govern domestic spy agencies.A comprehensive and comprehensible new law should be drafted from scratch,replacing the multitude of current powers and providing for clear limits and safeguardson any intrusive power that it may be necessary for public authorities to use, saysAndersons report.The opportunity now exists to take a system characterised by confusion, suspicion
and incessant legal challenge, and transform it into a world-class framework for the
regulation of strong and vital powers. I hope that opportunity will be taken, it adds.Last month the UK government confirmeda new Investigatory Powers Bill will be put forward in the current parliament, which will include provisions to modernize the law in this area.How exactly that will be done is unclear at this point; a draft versionof thebill hasnot yet been published likelybecause the government was waiting for Andersons review to be delivered. Soit remains to be seen which of hisrecommendations filter into the forthcoming legislation. But ripping up RIPA and starting again is clear consensus.For the review Anderson was asked to consider various issues associated withsurveillance  including national security threats, current and future, plus the capabilities required to combat them; safeguards to protect privacy; challenges posed by changing technologies; issues relating to transparency and oversight; and the effectiveness of existing legislation  including its proportionality  and the case for new or amending legislation. On the latter point his recommendations are unequivocal that a clean slate is indeed required.He setsout his five principles on which thereport is based as:Snoopers charter needs justifyingLast year the U.K. government failed in anattempt to introduce more expansive surveillance powers  such as logging websites visited and retaining thecontents of messages sent via social media services (the so-called Snoopers Charter, aka the Communications Data Bill). But its lining up for another expansion attemptin the forthcomingInvestigatory Powers Bill arguing this is necessary to plug what it dubs capability gaps in domestic intelligence gathering.Andersons report specifically addresses the proposedmeasures set out in theCommunications Data Bill. And while hes supportive of IP matching, which has been brought in via another piece of legislation (theCounter Terrorism and Security Act2015), he expresses strong reservations about the other powers the government was keento push through (retaining browsing logs and third party comms data)  even if, in keeping with his principle of minimizing no-go areas, he does not explicitly reject further expansion of surveillance capabilities.Anderson writes (emphasis mine):The compulsory retention of records of user interaction with the internet (weblogs or similar) would be useful for attributing communications to individualdevices, identifying use of communications sites and gathering intelligence orevidence on web browsing activity. But if any proposal is to be brought forward,a detailed operational case needs to be made out, and a rigorous assessmentconducted of the lawfulness, likely effectiveness, intrusiveness and cost ofrequiring such data to be retained.There should be no question of progressing proposals for the compulsoryretention of third party data before a compelling operational case for it hasbeen made out (as it has not been to date) and the legal and technical issueshave been fully bottomed out.Elsewhere, in a section on transparency, he alsourges greater openness in the operations of covert powers:Whilst the operation of covert powers is and must remain secret, public authorities,ISIC and the IPT [Investigatory Powers Tribunal; the court overseeing domestic intelligence agencies] should all be as open as possible in their work. Intrusive capabilitiesshould be avowed. Public authorities should consider how they can better informParliament and the public about why they need their powers, how they interpret thosepowers, the broad way in which those powers are used and why additionalcapabilities may be required.Commenting on the report in a statement, Anderson added: Modern communications networks can be used by the unscrupulous for purposes ranging from cyber-attack, terrorism and espionage to fraud, kidnap and child sexual exploitation. A successful response to these threats depends on entrusting public bodies with the powers they need to identify and follow suspects in a borderless online world. But trust requires verification.Each intrusive power must be shown to be necessary, clearly spelled out in law, limited in accordance with international human rights standards and subject to demanding and visible safeguards.The current law is fragmented, obscure, under constant challenge and variable in the protections that it affords the innocent. It is time for a clean slate. This Report aims to help Parliament achieve a world-class framework for the regulation of these strong and vital powers.Responding to the report, civil liberties organization Liberty welcomed Andersons call to fundamentally overhaul surveillance legislation. It alsosupports his call for judicial review of interception warrants.However the organization expressed disappointment that the review supports the continued practice ofmass surveillance  noting this positiongoes against thegrain within the wider European context. It is currently helping to bring a legal challenge against the U.K. governmentfor sanctioningmass surveillance.Liberty writes:The report offers six Agency case studies in an attempt at justifying mass interception. However, with the vague and limited information provided, it is impossible to assess whether the security outcomes could have been achieved by using the wealth of targeted and operation-led intrusive surveillance powers at the Agencies disposal.While Liberty does not dispute the use and value of intrusive surveillance powers per se, we believe that the mass speculative interception of communications and data retention are unlawful, unnecessary and disproportionate. Liberty is currently challenging the lawfulness of mass interception in the European Court of Human Rights, and is representing MPs Tom Watson and David Davis in their legal challenge to DRIPA.Andersons report can be read in full here.
