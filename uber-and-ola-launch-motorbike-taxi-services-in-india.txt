Bangalore is the setting for the latest showdown between Uber and its fierce India-based rival Ola after both companies launched motorbike taxi on-demand services in the city.Ola, which is backed by Tiger Global and has an alliance with Lyft and other Uber rivals worldwide, rolled out its pilot service last night, while Uber announced the arrival of UberMoto, which debuted in Thailandlast month, this morning.A primary painpoint in India is congestion,Anand Subramanian, director of marketing communication at Ola, told TechCrunch in an interview. Bikes are a very popularmode of personal transportation, there are millions on the road in India, and they are a faster way to go from point Ato B.Grab, Olas partner in Southeast Asia, has operated motorbike taxis for more than a year andSubramanian said that it helped provide advice for Olas service, which has been months in the making.Subramaniandidnt reveal figures  the service has just launched  but he said demand isalready high. Ola, he added, is aiming fora three- to five-minute pick-up time for passengers, each of whom will be given a helmet by their bike rider as standard. Initially, Ola is initially using registered and trained motorbike taxi drivers, but it plans to open the service up for others in thenear future.Uber has already opened its service up to interested motorbike owners in Bangalore, potentially giving it an early advantage. Although Olas service is available across Bangalore, but Ubers is initially operational incentral parts of the city only.Speaking at last months launch in Bangkok, the company said it has also mandated helmets for passengers while, like Ola, insurance is held by the bike rider, much like the setup for its regular cars.Theres not much to choose on price between the two services right now. Uber is charging a minimum of 15 INR, with a base fare of 15 INR and then 3 INR per kilometer or 1 INR per minute. Ola is 2 INR per kilometer and 1 INR per minute, with a minimum fare of 30 INR.With margins this low, the services are designed to operate atscale,Subramanian said.This is so much more [that just journeys, theres] potential to reach many millions more users, and motorbikesfit in with our mission of building mobility forone billion people in India. The operating cost of a bike is far lower than a car and [though trip prices are low,]margins will come with scale, theres tremendous potential to scale, he explained.What kind of services could a fleet of bike taxis prompt?Subramanian wasnt specific and neither was Uber when we talked to the company about UberMoto last month, but a large numberof bike drivers could act asa logistics layer to enablea range of non-ride services, such as on-demand deliveries, on a national scale.Ola already has grocery and food on-demand services, but they are limited to major cities and  according to one report  the grocery service, at least, could close down. Margins could be significantly higher and service response time quicker with a larger pool of drivers on standby. Likewise, for Uber, whichoffers on-demand services worldwide but not in India, a large number of bikes on-demand could unlock new opportunities in the country.Indonesia is the best example of what motorbike taxi services can aspire to be. Go-Jek, a company backed by Sequoia and is frequentlybilled as the Uber of motorbike taxis, has more than 200,000 drivers and, beyond shuttling passengers around Jakartas clogged roads, it offers food, grocery and document services.Thats hugely useful in bustling, congestion-ridden Asian megacities like Jakarta, Bangkok or Bangalore.Indonesia-based Go-Jek offers food delivery services among other things
