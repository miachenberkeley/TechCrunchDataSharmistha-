Taxi app Uber, which continues tobattleregulatory clamp downs and legal confrontations in Europe, has appointeda former VPof the European Unions executive arm, the European Commission, to itspublic policy advisory board as it looks to grease the gearboxof its regional fortunes.The ex-VP in question, former digital agenda commissioner Neelie Kroes  who stepped down fromher role in the European Unions executive body in November 2014, after serving a five-year term in digital policy(and some 10 years in all as a European Commissioner)  wasa vocal supporter of Uber during her time inpost.Prior to leaving officein 2014, for example, Kroes loudly condemneda ban of Uber in Belgium,publicly proclaimingthatUber is 100% welcome in Brussels and everywhere else as far as I am concerned.So the move hardly comes as a surprise, although for anyone concerned about the revolving door between seniorpoliticiansand theprivatesector,it should raise some seriouseyebrows.As Ars Technica notes, the appointment of Kroes by Uber falls outside the ECs18-month conflict of interest period, which is intended to throw a wedgein the unsightly revolving door that sees ex-politicians with powerful public sector connections switch toselling their services to the companies that used to lobby them whilst they were in public office. Albeit not a permanent wedge, clearly.Kroes appointment is especially interesting given that the EC is currently paying some very specificattention to Uber. Last October, Kroes former employer launcheda study of the companyaiming to probe the social, economic and legal consequences of its business operations, with a view to deciding whether new legislation might beneeded to properly regulate its business.The study also looks atthe impact ofsimilar transportation network companies (TNCs), as the ECcalls them.One key question is whether the EC will end up decidingTNCs should be considered transportation services, and regulated as such  rather than just as (Uberspreferred self-categorization) digital platform providers.The EC describes thisreview as a first analysis, setting outto gather data on the various questions and concerns being generatedby these types ofbusiness models. So theres no explicit threat to Ubers modus operandi at aEuropean Unionlevel, as yet. But the Commission does suggest there couldbe scope for a coordinated response in the future.European institutions have the competence to bring together the fragmented response to TNCs which is happening at the national level. This could be done through legislation, regulatory actions or the judiciary, it notes.Evidently Uber will be hoping Kroes presence on its public policy board, and the advice she is able to feed them, helps steer away the threat of any newEuropean-wide moves to undermine its regulatoryadvantages versus traditional taxi firms.In ablog announcing the full complement of policy board members (eight in all), Ubers chief advisorand member of the board of directors,David Plouffe, expends a lot of pixels talking up the societal benefits, as Uber sees it, of its business, before moving on to the regulatory piece.Just a few years ago only one place (California) had a regulatory framework for ridesharing. Today more than 70 jurisdictions in the U.S. do, and many other places around the globe are following suit, including in Australia, Canada, India, the Philippines and Mexico, he enthuses.As ridesharing continues to grow, we look forward to the Boards candid advice and insights.As well asKroes, Ubers policy board also includes another former senior politician: Ray LaHood, the former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation.A spokesman for Uber declined toanswer a question asking how itresponds to criticism of the revolving door between senior politicians and the private sector.TechCrunch understands all board members are being financially recompensed for their policy workfor Uber.Its not Kroes only private sector appointment since leaving public office. Back in March it was announced she would be joiningthe board of directors of Salesforce.com.That appointment became effective on May 1.
