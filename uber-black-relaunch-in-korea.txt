Theres good news for Uber in Korea, where it has reopened its Uber Black private car service in the country after nearly a year of uncertainty.After finding Uber guilty of violating local transportation rules, Korean officials forced the U.S. companyto limit Uber Black to the elderly, disabled, government officials and foreigners only. But, as of today, those restrictions have been lifted to enable anyone to grab a ride.Thats thanks to new regulations which have alsoallowed Kakao, the company behind Koreas top chat appKakao Talk, to offer its own private car service:the not-so-creatively-named Kakao Black. Kakao began offering a ride-sharing service that coupled users with registered taxis from March, but now it is in a position to offer more options  namely a fleet of200 Kakao Black drivers in Seoul.(This was thesituation for Uberwhen I visited Seoul earlier this year.)Ouch, Uber is pretty kneecapped in Seoul pic.twitter.com/fswTJJoEYT Jon Russell (@jonrussell) April 13, 2015Todays news is a positive step for Uber, but its peer-to-peer Uber X service remains out of action in Korea after being closed down in March following government pressure. Thats a situation that itis working to fix next.We want to be able to offer more products, so [reopening Uber X in Korea] issomething that wed like to explore with the government, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.As part ofopening Uber Black up to a wider audience, Uber said it is working with authorities to help provide more transportation options during challenging times like Friday and Saturday. Thats as part of a Taxi Happy Zone being run in the city.That was echoed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government which called Ubera real benefit for citizens, especially at times and at locations, such as late Friday and Saturday nights at Gangnam Station and other busy spots, when other transport options are not so readily available.Ubers business is more visible in Seoul, but theres no update on whether Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is welcome in Korea, however. Authorities threatened Kalanick with jail timelast year, but Uber declined to comment on whether the situation has changed.
