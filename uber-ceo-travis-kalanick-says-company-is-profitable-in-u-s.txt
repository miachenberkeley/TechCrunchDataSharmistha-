Uber is officially profitable in the U.S., Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told Canadian publication BetaKit earlier this week. H/t to Fortune for peeling out the buried news in that story, which was titled Travis Kalanick Speaks Out: Ubers CEO On Risk, Regulation, and Women in Tech.Heres the key chunk, straight out of the horses mouth:Were profitable in the USA, but were losing over $1 billion a year in China, Kalanick told BetaKit. We have a fierce competitor thats unprofitable in every city they exist in, but theyre buying up market share. I wish the world wasnt that way. I prefer building rather than fundraising. But if I dont participate in the fundraising bonanza, Ill get squeezed out by others buying market share.Last year, Kalanick told employees that the company would be profitable in Q2 of this year,according to Bloomberg. Its not clear when Uber became profitable. TechCrunch has reached out to Uber and will update this story if we receive any additional information.Meanwhile, Uber, which has raised about $9 billion, could go public as soon as sometime this year, according to a leaked document published by Reuters.
