Uber China, the U.S. ride-sharing firms standalone company in China, finally closed its long-awaited Series B funding round yesterday ending a long process that began lastsummer, when many of the companys financial details were leaked to the public.The fundraising values the Uber China business at $7 billion  thats a pre-money figure  but the size of the round, which the company said was over-subscribed, was not disclosed.You can take that lack of disclosurearound the amount raisedas youd like. An indicator that it fell short of areported$2.5 billion expectation(having raised its initial $1.2 billion target), or a business decision to keep private things private?Uber China also declined to reveal its full slate of investors when we asked. The roster doesinclude existing investor Baidu, Uber Global and non-China-based backers, and those revealed publiclyappear to be potentially useful allies.Automaker GIC, announced in December, is joined by HNA Group, a Fortune 500 company that runs Chinas largest private airline, China Taiping Insurance, which is listed in Hong Kong and already providing rider insurance for Uber China, China Life, another insurance company, and investment bank CITIC Securities.Uber China was particularly keen to talk upthe significance ofHNA Group.The two companies will work together to develop innovative travel solutionsfor Chinese and global travellers, taking advantage of HNA Groups global network of interests covering aviation, financing, logistics, and tourism, it said in a press release.Uber is hugely bullishabout China, and for good reason.Plus, Uber Chinas business is doing a lot better than many expected.The company reach one million completed rides per day across China  where it currently covers 22 cities  this past summer. Thats close to beingmore than Uberdoes across the rest of the world combined each day.Then theres the fact that four of Ubers largest cities, in terms of ride volume, are located in China. No surprise then that the company is looking to go live in 100 more cities in China this year.To take Uber/Uber Chinas own words from its Series B deck  which TechCrunchgot hold of China is the worlds most compelling market right now.Uber is seeing much faster uptake in China than in the U.S..(Much of that is likely because it wasnt the first to pioneer the industry in China, as it didwith Lyft inthe U.S..)China will soon be Ubers top market.The company believes that Uber China can break even by 2018 on annual net revenue of more than $2.4 billion.Uber predicts thatits total bookings in China this year (2016) will surpassits total bookingworldwide in 2014.But  and heres the big but  despite impressive growth and figures, Uber is playing second fiddle to Didi Kuaidi in China.The Chinese company, which was formed through a multi-billion dollar merger of Chinas top two Uber rivals one year ago, is ahead on every front:One bright spot for Uber in China isthat the company pioneered, and led, the peer-to-peer transportation bracket in the country. Uber claimed, in its deck, that it is dominant on peer-to-peer bookings in a handful of major cities though it declined to reveal which ones.That early-mover advantage didnt last all that long.Didi Kuaidi started out working with licensed taxis and private (black) car drivers butitstepped into the peer-to-peerspace in June 2015.Given its brand and reach in China, youd expect that it is narrowing any gap that Uber had over it.Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told a press event that any lead Didi Kuaidi has is down to the company spending larger amounts on driver subsidies and promotions for passengers.They spend more per ride than us. Its easy to find the information  you can talk to your local Uber or Didi driver and ask them how much theyre getting. This means that if they are bigger than us, as they claim they are, then they must be spending more, Kalanick said  according to quotes supplied by Uber Chinas PR team.Our best information right now is that Didi is spending US$70 million to US$80 million a week on subsidies  thats US$4 billion a year, the Uber chief added.Kalanick at Uber Chinas press conference to announce its Series B funding roundThat, Kalanick argues, is proof that Uber is around for the long-term and is being smart about its spending. Uber has also complained bitterly that Didi Kuaidi investor Tencent has locked it out of WeChat, Chinas top social platform and a key service for interacting with consumers, which  rightly or wrongly is a factor.Even if Uber continues to beanalso-ran in China, much like Lyft is in the U.S., the countrystill stands to be a hugelyimportant for it. This year itll be interesting to watch how Uber expands its footprint into more cities and whether Uber China raises additional money and (finally) appoints a country head. On the latter point, the company claimed that its business is run by local and regional teams but it already has a figurehead in India, and thus it stands to reason that it will do the same in China  assuming it can find the right person to drive its business forward.
