The California Public Utilities Commission has fined Uber $7.6 million for failing to fully and timely meet the agencys reporting requirements. Uber has 30 days to pay the penalty, otherwise, its operating license will be suspended in California. The CPUC also heldthe company in contempt and imposed an additional $1,000 fine.According to the CPUC, Uber failed to provide information in a full and timely fashion around the number and percentage of customers who requested accessible cars, and how often it could provide rides for them. It also failed to provide information around service information, like the number of rides passengers requested and drivers accepted within each zip code, as well as driver safety information. The purpose of providing that information is to help the CPUC ensure that Uber is providing services in a non-discriminatorymanner enabling equal access to all and that the services are being provided in a manner that promotes public safety.While we are disappointed by the decision, we look forward to making our case to the California Court of Appeals, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. In the meantime, we will pay the fine and continue to work in good faith with the Commission.Uber has since given the CPUC all of the data it has requested. Although Uber plans to pay the fine, the company disagrees on how the agency calculated the fine, which is what Uber plans to appeal. According to the latest numbers, Uber is worth $62.5 billion.
