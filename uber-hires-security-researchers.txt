Uber has hired the duo behind a spectacular hack earlier this year that involved taking remote control of a Jeep Cherokee.Wired writer Andy Greenberg experienced this firsthand.He wrote that he was driving on a St. Louis highway when Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek used a laptop 10 miles away to make the radio, air conditioning and windshield wipers go haywire. Then they cut the transmission entirely. (To be clear, this wasnt just a terrible prank  it was a demonstration that hadbeen arranged beforehand.)At the time, Miller and Valasek worked as security researchers at Twitter and IOActive, respectively. But Reuters reported today that the two of them have joined Uber, and the news was confirmed in tweets by Miller and Ubers Raffi Krikorian.So I guess that when the time comes, Ubers self-driving cars will have some safeguards against hacking.
