Uber is synonymous with its cashless payment experience, but thats about to change. At least in India, initially.Thats because the ride-hailing gianthas kicked off a pilot program testing cash payments in one city in the South Asian country: Hyderabad. There, Uber customers will be able to pay their fare in cash, using a new option that must be selected before requesting a ride.Uber has hinted in the past that it would be flexible on payments in emerging markets  it added cash payments for auto rickshaw rides in New Delhi in April  and now it is fully kicking the tires with this pilot.Hyderabad was the only city specifically selected for this experiment because it provides us with the right environment to test a new payment option amongst a sizable and sophisticated rider and driver community, Uber said in a blog post.Picking India as a test bed makes sense for a number of reasons. Credit card penetration is as low as just 2 percentso cash opens its service up to potentially millions ofcustomers who wouldnt ordinarily be able to use it. That said, Uber has adopted Paytms digital wallet,which allows customers to deposit money into their accounts without plastic, butcash payments are synonymous with takingtaxis  plustheres no technology barrier to discourage would-be customers.Uber currently serves 11 cities in India, while market leader Ola  which last monthclosed $400 million in new funding  is present in more than 110, with plans to reach 200 by the end of 2015. With a far smaller geographical footprint, Uber has thus far targeted an urban and more premium customer basein India.But, if this cash experiment is widened across the country, it might just be a sign that the U.S. companyis keento move beyond this initial, narrowfocus.As for the significance of cash payments, itsworth noting that half of Olas payments come in the form of cash, according to comments made to BuzzFeed. So, while Uber is removingone of thecore pillars that its known for  the companyeulogizes the convenience of cashlesspayments  a morebasic approach might help it win market share in India, and potentially other emerging markets in the future.
