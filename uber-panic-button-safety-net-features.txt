Update, 11 February: The features are now live on the Android app, coming to iOS soon.Late last year, Uber announced plans for tighter safety measures in India following the rape of a passenger using itsservicein December. Now it has confirmed that two major features  an in-app panic button and journey/location sharing  will roll out to users in IndiaonFebruary 11The company went public with the launch date after Times Of India reported that the Mumbai transportation department was considering a ban on its serviceover its apparent approach to safety. Authorities are reportedlynot happy with Uber representatives responses during various meetings held to consider measures for passengers safety.Uber clearedthe air on its plans to settle some misconceptions around its safety policy  which already includes more stringentbackground checks and a dedicated emergency response team. That will be boosted when the in-app panic button, which alerts local police when triggered, and a safety net feature, which goes beyond Ubersexisting share my ETA feature to letcustomers share details of theirlocation and trip with up to five other people, golive in India next week.The company previously said that these features will be rolled out worldwide at a later date, but India is the first priorityin response toheightened concerns aboutsafety following the rape incident.Times Of India also reported that Uber has irked Mumbai authorities with its reluctance toinstallphysical panic buttons in its drivers cars, something that new regulations havemademandatoryin the city.Notes from the transportation department reportedly readthat Uber appears [to]want to put the onus of passenger safety on a cabs owner and driver.Uber argued, however, that requiring physical panic buttons would be confusing becausemanydrivers use multiple taxi app services. Since each one button is connected to a single taxi app service, that would necessitatemultiple physical panic buttons in many cars, it argued.In a situation of distress the rider would have to pick the correct operators panic button to be able to get help on time. [In a car that works with Indias four top taxi app services] thats 25 percent chance of success; and a decision that has to be made and executed in a split-second, if at all, Uber said in a blog post.Uber did proposea single panic button  installed by the driver and connected directly to the local police  as abetter option. However, it then hitoutat officials in Mumbai, addingthat forward looking regulatory authorities in India are already embracing this position and requiring technology platforms to have in-app safety features.The Uber returned to the roadin New Delhi last month, six weeks after it was banned following the rape. The U.S. company applied for a mandatory radio license and revealed that it has adopted a non-profit modelin the city until itis granted.
