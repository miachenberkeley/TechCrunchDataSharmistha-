Besides a leaked screenshot of a revenue dashboard in 2013, Uber (like most private startups) has been notoriously secretive when it comes to sharing any data about ride statistics.Now,as an attempt to rebuff NYC Major Bill de Blasio before the City Councils vote on a potential new driver cap for ride share companies, Uber is releasing exact ride numbersfor the past two months in NYC.In a 56-page Excel document, the company details numbers of pickups and active drivers (ones currently on the roadwith the Uber app turned on) for the past two months, all broken down by hour. The company also broke these rides down into ones that originated below 59th Street in New Yorks central business district, where NYCs congestion is the worst.While de Blasio has arguedthat Uberand other ride sharing companiesare the main reason for NYCs increased congestion,the data revealed by Uber today suggests otherwise.Ubers data shows that thenumber of Ubers in NYC is actually much less than Yellow Cabs. Over a 24-hour period on July 19th there was an average of 3,198 drivers in New York City on Ubers platform. On the other hand, there are over 13,400 taxis in NYC, of which anywhere from 67 to 85 percent of those on the road at one time.Some interesting things from the data release:The month of June saw 3,492,389 Uber pickups in NYC. While this pales in comparison to the 14,000,000+ trips provided a month by NYC yellow cabs, Ubers number is still pretty staggering for a relativelynew company.Ubers busiesttimes in NYCare almost always late at night, with some days nearing10,000 trips an hour (over 150 requests a minute) between 9pm  12am.Uber has been fighting an aggressive media war against de Blasio and the NYC City Council in anticipation of tomorrows vote. Besides thedata release today, the company also bought a banner ad that is currently running at the top of the New York Times website.Mayor de Blasio has been steadfast in his support of the bill, even as other NYC government officials (Including Scott Stringer, the citys Comptroller) have publicly supported Uber and other ride share companies.In an op-ed written in the NY Daily News, the Mayorwrote that [NYC is] facing the addition of over 25,000 cars to our streets over the next year  the rough equivalent of two times the total number of yellow taxis in all of New York City.Notably, records obtained by TechCrunch show that the NYC Taxi Industry hasdonated over $500,000to Mayor de Blasios campaign, and are the second-highest donor behind the real estate industry. Additionally, the billcapping new driver sign-ups was first sponsored by the taxi industry three months ago.
