With a huge blizzard bearing down on the U.S. Northeast, Uber is instituting a cap on its surge pricing during the storm. In an email being sent to New York passengers, the company said prices will not exceed 2.8x its usual fares.The cap comes after an agreement struck between Uber and the New York City Attorney Generals office in January 2014 that required Uber to limit prices during abnormal disruptions of the market, including emergencies and natural disasters. Uber also announced a national policy for its price limits during those emergencies.In an email to Bloomberg, Uber said the following:Dynamic pricing will be capped and all Uber proceeds will be donated to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts.The company later clarified to TechCrunch that the cap will be in place in any market that has declared a State of Emergency.While Uber plans to limit dynamic pricing during this storm, the company has had a bad history with emergency situations and surge pricing. In late 2012, Uber received criticism for raising fares during Hurricane Sandy. (The agreement with the NY AG came in part as a result of Hurricane Sandy backlash.)Uber has defended surge pricing in the past, noting that the higher rates lead to more drivers being out on the road at times when passengers are having a hard time getting around. But as the company has grown, Uber has been working to compromise with local regulators and city officials in markets around the world.Full text of Ubers letter to NYC passengers below:Dear ______,A major noreaster is expected to hit the City tonight bringing heavy snow and blowing wind over the next 2 days.
