Today, as you nurse your wounds from Black Friday stampedes outside your local mall, or sitin traffic as youmakeyour lengthy travelback home from the holidays, heres a reminder that life doesnt have to be so hard.Forget UberBLACK. This weekend, the whos who of absurdly wealthy peoplechilling in Dubai who arent skiing indoors or BASE jumping off of the Burj Dubai are grabbing UberCHOPPERs to take them on the 130km journey from Dubai to Abu Dhabi so that they can check out the 2015 F-1 Grand Prix happeningthere this weekend.Uber detailed that thepromotionwilldeliverluxury, convenience, and sky-high style all at the tap of a button.Heading to Abu Dhabi from Dubai for the Grand Prix? Skip the traffic and kick off your racingweekend withUberCHOPPER.The promotion is being offered via apartnership with Alpha Tours, a major tourism company in the UAE,whichUber is getting its airpower assistancefrom.The company appears to havea pretty classical approach to luxury according to their website.Exhibit A:For thosethrowing down the AED2,250 (about $612) per person, theycan be assured that the ride will not disappoint. Passengerswill get door-to-door Uber service from their pickup location to a helipad where theyll graba seat on an Agusta 109E Power helicopter. The helicopters sit six people so if youre down for a casual jaunt to the Grand Prix with your buddies, this could be the move.Dubai isnt the first place where UberCHOPPER has been offered; the luxury service has been sporadically available at major events for the past couple years, but its clear that its something Uber is only going to continue experimenting with. Earlier this month, Uber Manila offered Filipino citizens the chance to take afreeUberCHOPPER ride around the city.It isnt clear what the next step is for UberCHOPPER, and whether Jordan Belfort-types will soon be able to grab oneon-demand from the office helipad.What is apparentis that there are certain places where demand for this service is absurdlyhigh. Thank god theres no surge pricing on these things (at least for now).First world problems in Dubai.
