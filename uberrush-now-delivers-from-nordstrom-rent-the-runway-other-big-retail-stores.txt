UberRUSH, Ubers merchant delivery service, will now ship purchases within a few hours from household retail names like Nordstrom and 1800Flowers.It typically takes, at least, a few days for deliveries to arrive at your doorstep from most online retailers, but Uber introduced a private API that can integrate into the shopping experience of these bigger companies with the aim to get your items to you within a few hours.UberRUSH began delivering items from customers who wanted to get locally made purchases that very same day from mostlyindependent retailers in the fall of 2015.But Uber is not one to stay small and is now taking on other delivery platforms like FedEx and UPS to bring you all the things from the larger chain retailers, too.Were excited about how this product supports local businesses, but we also know that a lot of companies  and their customers  are looking for an easy way to get items delivered more quickly, Uber wrote in a statement about the move.The rideshare giant is using enterprise software platforms like SAP and partnering withBergen Logistics and Trade Global, which handle delivery logistics for retailers like Rebecca Minkoff and Cole Haan to get the job done on time.UberRUSH is also teaming up with startup services like the chat-based shopping assistant Operator and Curbside, a shopping platform that allows customers to pick their items and roll up to the curb to pick them up when theyre ready.Something pretty useful coming with this new offering (at least for me), you could use UberRUSH to order a better fitting dress or different dress size from Rent-the-Runway on the same day, should you find that ball gown you ordered is not the right fit right before your event.According to Uber, many of its retail partners are already running pilots in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City.And thepromise is pretty neat. Who wants to wait days to sign for deliveries when you can have them inside an afternoon? (No one, thats who).Is UberRUSH a FedEx killer? Who knows. But,at least, you wont have to wait around all day wondering when the delivery person might swing byif Uber delivers.
