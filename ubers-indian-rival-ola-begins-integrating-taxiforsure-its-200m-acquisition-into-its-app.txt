Ola, Indias homegrown rivalto Uber, paid out $200 million to buy smaller rival TaxiForSure in March, and now it has begun to integrate the service into its own app.The integration is rolling out city by city starting withMumbai and New Delhi, where Ola users with the latest version of the Android app can now bookTaxiForSures hatchback cars  its most popular vehicle option  via Ola. (An update is due to come to iOS soon.) Ola said theoption will arrivefor users inother cities in a phased manner over the next few weeks.Booking a TaxiForSure ride is the same process as any of Olas other kinds of services, which include food delivery, sedans, minis, primes and auto rickshaws. Users just select the TaxiForSure option and then make their pick-up request as usual.Its still early days for the integration, however, and hatchbacks are the only type of TaxiForSure ride available via Ola at this point. Likewise, billing is still handled by TaxiForSure, which means that it doesnt show up inside the Ola app, socash to the driver is theonly payment method for now.This integration doesnt spell the end for TaxiForSures service, thatwill continue to be a standalone business with its own apps too, butincreasingtransport options within Olas app makes absolute sense, for both strengthening the service and improving optionsfor users.The move will also help TaxiForSure drivers get instant access to a lot more users from the Ola app,Anand Subramanian, director of marketing and communications at Ola, told TechCrunch.TaxiForSure hatchbacks areanother essential category, headded. TaxiForSure has taken a very strong position as an economic player and a category in itself.Despite the integration, Subramanian explained thatthere isno immediate plans to add other vehicle categories from TaxiForSure to the Ola app.He did, however, say that Ola is working to provide additional payment options for TaxiForSure rides that are booked via Ola.Ola, which is backed by SoftBank and has raised more than $600million from investors to date. Following its $400 million Series Eround which closed in April, the company revealed plans to be in 200 cities across India before the end of 2015.The acquisition of TaxiForSure was an important one that represents genuine consolidation in India and gives Ola a chance to take on Uber.Right now, Ola currently claims to offer over 100,000 1.5 million vehicles across more than67 100 cities in the country, whileTaxiForSure has 15,00024,000 vehicles across 47 cities. Thats a significant boost, but TaxiForSurewasnt just about juicing Olas coverage, there are plans to develop it too. A $100 million tranche of that Series E round was set aside for TaxiForSure, and it will be used to grow into additional cities in India.Uber itself has also been busy in India. It hired its first President to run its business in India and took on strategic investment from India media firm Times Internet to furtherlocalize its service in India.The U.S. company has, of course, also experienced controversy in the country. The alleged rape of a passenger in New Delhi caused its service to be suspendednow available again, Uber is currently operating a no profit model in the city, where itbegan working with a safety data service to provide more information to passengers.Note: The original version of this article was updated with new figures from Ola and TaxiForSure.
