Though Uber has been shy about revealing investor names, rumors suggest that Sequoia, TPG, Fidelity Investments, Wellington Management, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and/or Menlo Ventures may have participated.The NYT reports that Uber decided to expand the Series E round after overwhelming demand from institutional investors to participate in the financing.
