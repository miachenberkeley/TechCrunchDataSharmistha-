Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution, wants to bring its operating system to moreconnected devices and intelligent objects with the launch of its snappy Ubuntu Core for the Internet of Things today. Over the last few months, the company launched snappy versions of Core on a number of cloud computing services, but given that the whole idea behindCore is to offer stripped-down versions of Ubuntu that developers can then easily customize based on their needs, the Internet of Things and robotics applications are a logical next area of focus for Canonical.Ubuntu Core lets developers install the basic OS and then addthe applications and services they need. Those applications then run in their own sandboxed environments. Ubuntu Core also features transactional updates, which ensures that the update process either works perfectly or can be rolled back immediately if things go awry.From scientific breakthroughs by autonomous robotic explorers to everyday miracles like home safety and energy efficiency, our world is being transformed by smart machines that can see, hear, move, communicate and sense in unprecedented ways, said Canonical founder and occasional space cowboy Mark Shuttleworth in todays announcement. Ubuntu Core is the secure platform for super-smart stuff, with an app store that brings the very latest software straight to your device and easy connections to every cloud.Among the first to use Ubuntu Core for their devices is Ninja Blocks Ninja Sphere home app platform.The open Ninja Sphere controller based on Ubuntu Core is a perfect base for building apps that interact with devices and sensors in your home, said Daniel Friedman, the CEO of Ninja Blocks, in todays announcement. Other early users include Erle Robotics, which is using it in its Erle-Copter educational drone (making it the first Ubuntu Core-powered drone). Ubuntu is also at the core of the Open Source Robotics Foundations work.
