The director of UK spy agency, GCHQ, has urgedcloser co-operation between governments and the tech sector to end what he dubbed the abuse of encryption, describing it asa moral problem whichdemocratic societies must grapple with in order to strike a balance between security and privacy.Giving a speech at MIT yesterday, Robert Hannigan called for the tech industry to help governments and security agencies find technicalsolutions to workaround encryption  although he claimed he is not advocating for backdoors to be mandated. Or for security systems to be deliberately weakened. But he was less clear on exactly what he is advocating.I am consciously avoiding offering solutions, because I dont have them, and I think we will need to find them together, he said. I suspect those solutions will be diverse and fragile and dynamic in the future: they will not be 20th Century solutions.The solution is not, of course, that encryption should be weakened, let alone banned. But neither is it true that nothing can be done without weakening encryption, he added. I am not in favour of banning encryption. Nor am I asking for mandatory backdoors.Hannigan expressed frustration about the current  as he sees it  all or nothing nature of the encryption debate, arguing that almost every attempt to tackle the misuse of encryption by criminals and terrorists is seen as a backdoor, adding:It is an over-used metaphor, or at least mis-applied in many cases, and I think it illustrates the confusion of the ethical debate in what is a highly-charged and technically complex area.His comments come at a time when Apple is fighting a high profile legal battle with the FBI over the measures it should be legally required to take to assist in unlocking an iPhone that was used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. That battle has since spilled over into Congress, with politicians grappling with just such questions of the balance between security obligations and constitutional freedoms.On encryption Hannigan called for some very practical cooperation with the industry, although he did not get so specific as to detailwhat this practical cooperation would entail  although he dropped some leadinghints as to the intelligence agencys thinking,suggesting thepreferred route might beto co-opt companies to help security agencies exploit weaknesses in their own encryption systems to afford access to spooks when a legal warrant is requiring it.On this Hannigan invokeda historical example referencing British mathematician Alan Turings work during world war II to cracktheNazis Enigma code, and noting that the exploitation of a few key flaws in the otherwise brilliant design of the commercial Enigma machine enabled that strongly encrypted code to be cracked.So it doesnt take the joining of too many dots to envisage the kind of co-operationGCHQ might be advocating for,vis-a-vis tech companiesIn recent times the British spy agency has found itsactivities under more public scrutiny than they might prefer, in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowdens 2013 disclosures about government masssurveillance activity.Hannigan did not reference Snowden but did refute accusations that UK spy agencies deploy mass surveillance techniques. As UK court judgements over the past two years have confirmed, our bulk collection does not equal bulk surveillance. They are different things, he claimed.He also claimed thatdraftUK surveillance powerslegislationwhich iscurrently being debated in parliamentdoes not equate to an expansion of state powers  despite critics saying the very opposite and dubbing the bill a new Snoopers Charter.In the post-Snowden era, GCHQ has beenlearning the dos and donts ofapplying a little marketing gloss to its message. Last fall, for example, writing in the FT newspaper,Hannigan madea public appeal to US tech companies to co-operate in handing over user data  arguing that tech platform had become the command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals.Yesterdays message was evidently intended to be a little less accusatory, a little more conciliatory.The comments caused a bigger stir than I expected, he said, referencing his phrasing from the November article. And were widely seen as an attack on the tech industry. In fact I wanted to start a debate in the UK about how democratic Governments and the tech sector could work together within a clear and sufficiently transparent legal framework.Our worlds overlap, but they are not the same; my point this afternoon is that they do not need to collide, he added.You can read Hannigans speech in full here.
