Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.Aftertakingtherunwayat New York Fashion Week, fashion techismakinga play for the bedroom. Anew collectionof underthings and intimates startups are gettingdown to basics  andventure investors are seeing 50 shades of green.Its not a lot of money yet, but the surge in seed funding over the pasttwo years indicates growing investor interest in tech-enabledbasics brands. From Andreessen Horowitzto First Round, over 100 venture firms and angel investors closed deals forunderwear startups since 2012, according to CrunchBase data.Underwear alone in the U.S. is a $15 billion-plus market per year in terms of revenue, says Bryan Lalezarian, CEO of basics brand MeUndies.MeUndies has raised over $1 million in venture cash to deliver trendy underwear to hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and Lalezarian says theyre currently raising more. A handful of bold marketing moves, including a sponsorship forcrotch-grabbing football star Marshawn Lynch and a collection of photo ads deemed toosexualfor Facebook, have generateda lot of recent attention for the three-year-oldstartup.If you think about the tools that we have today with social media Instagram, Snapchat, obviously Facebook and Twitter  there are a lot of unique ways we can connect directly to customers to deliver our message, tell our story, and sell our brand, and thosedidnt exist 20 years ago when companies like Gap and Victorias Secret got started, says Lalezarian.According to CrunchBase data, underthings startups have closed 22 venture rounds since 2013  the majority of which are very early-stage as investors test the waters.Underwear may seemlike a strange choiceforSilicon Valleys finest VCs,but basics brands and investors both have a lot to gain by mimickingthe business planof a typical tech startup.Its very difficult to scale a business withinventory and product without sufficient capital. If we dont have a product to deliver against the demand were creating, then were dead, says Brian Berger, founder and CEO of mens basics brand Mack Weldon.Yesterday, Mack Weldon announced a fresh $4 million in Series A fundingto bring its total raised to nearly $6 million in two years. Andy Appelbaum, partner at Mack Weldon backer RiverPark Ventures,saystheirlatest deal for the mens basics brand wasa no-brainer.The holy grail for a brand is to have a direct conversation with the customer without anintermediary retailer between you  youre terribly vulnerable when you have to worry about shelf space and who the favorite brand of the season is, says Appelbaum. If youre working with acompany optimized toreplenish inventoryand get the customer to buy directly from you, it becomes really powerful.Eliminating the middle man is potentiallymore beneficialin the basics marketthan in any other apparel vertical.This category specifically is one that has historically been very commoditized  its really all been about cheap, multi-pack, mass-produced stuff to buy on sale  but that is very different from the role that these products play in a consumers life, says Berger. This is the only thing in your closet that you wear every single day  it dictates how comfortable you are, how your other clothes fit and feel, and it matters, he says.And once a customer is sold, an online basics brandhas a straightshot at keepingthatcustomer for the long-run. People always need more underwear, sizing is relatively static, and theres not much advantage to shopping in-store for a product you cant try on.Investors like it because of the repeatability and the consumable nature of what we sellcustomers come back on a replenishment cycle, whether its explicit because we have some kind of auto-replenishment system, or whether its something that we stimulate through CRM, Berger says.And thats wheretechcomes in handy. By remindingcustomersto replenish their socks and underwear through an app, these tech-driven basics brands are able to boosttheirsales revenues at startup speed. MeUndies saw a 400% growth in revenue last year, and Mack Weldon reports 200% year-over-year growth with a 40% reorder rate in less than six months.Thats whats really getting a lot of new VCs excited about new industries  there are these massive markets, like underwear alone, and if you take a more modern approach and think outside the box there are some really interesting ways to make a big dent in that market really quickly, says Lalezarian. Warby Parker is a very obvious example of a company that did that in eyewear, and were doing the same thing in underwear and basics.
