United we stand, divided we fall. So goes the old saying thatsearch and mobile giant Google is now taking to heart in Europe, as it facesoff with regulators and rivals in the region. The company is merging its European regional and product operations into asingle unit, to be led by Matt Brittin, formerly the head of Googles operations in northern and western Europe, who now becomes EMEA President.Carlo DAsaro Biondo, who had been in charge of southern and eastern European business, will now lead on commercial partnerships across the bigger region.The announcement was made ata presentation in Brussels, home of the European Commission, and one big sign of where Google is hoping the news will have an impact. TheFT also reported news of the change yesterday evening.The changes will help Google manage pan-European operations more easily  providing single points of contact for business partners doing business with Google in Europe  but it will also mean that Google will be able to providemore unified resources to cope with country-specific problems that come up on the regulatory front.For its part, Google is also presenting the move as its own way of endorsing the Commissions bigger push for single-market regulations, which essentially means a set of rulesand administrative practices that will be consistent across all of Europe.The company followed up moments ago with ablog postpresenting the soft diplomacy side of the news. It is committing 25 million for digital skills training for small businesses, covering 1 million people, by 2016.Well build a Europe-wide training hub to support businesses anywhere in Europe to get training online, Brittin writes. There is also a video showcasing some of the inspiring ways that Google has already done this. We cant bring ourselvesto put it in here as its too much of a blatant commercial.The split operations were first put in place years ago by former Google executive Nikesh Arora in a very Machiavellian move: the idea had been to divide operations so that regions would compete against each other more keenly, according tothe FT.These days, Googles bigger competitive threat is coming in another form: regulators aregoing after the company from a number of angles, being propelled in part by an angry mob of businesses and consumers.The list of challenges that Google is facing in Europeinclude accusations of Google being anticompetitive both in search; andin mobile (Android is by far the biggest mobile operating system, with share of over80% in some markets). The company is also being probed on how it handles privacy issues  with new issuesin data protection seemingly growing by the day.The search case is particularly thorny one. Google dominates search in Europe, and it has been the subject of a long-running antitrust case lobbied by businesses that claim that Google has created an unfair advantage for itself in different categories of vertical search  that is, searches for results in specific areas like travel and news. Last year it looked like Google might actually get off the hook with relatively little impact, although the case then got reopened with deeper scrutiny.Sources tell us that thelatest on this is that Googles chairman Eric Schmidt will be meeting withMargrethe Vestager, the new antitrust commissioner, next week to discuss the case.On the side of more commercial problems, Google itself is not immune to encroaching competition, even as it dominates in search and mobile. One big area where it has fallen flat has been social, and while no one may ever beat Google at search, you have to wonder if at some point the goal posts may simply just change.Just talking with publishers the other day, many get most of their traffic from Facebook or Twitter, not from Google,Brittintold the Financial Times. Were in a world where the dynamics and competition is speeding up.Put simply, bringing the company together in Europe is about presenting a unified front.Search de-listing of personal dataOne of the biggestareas where Google has been coming under pressure in Europe is last years so-called right to be forgotten ruling by Europes top court, the ECJ.As background, thecourt determined that search engines are data controllers and therefore subject to European data protection legislation. Specificallyitrequires search enginesto process URL de-listing requests from private individuals, whenincorrect, out of date or no longer relevant information isforegrounded inthe search results that are served for their name.Google holds a massively dominant share of the search market in Europe so the ECJs ruling weighs most heavily on itsbusiness.Last year it set up an online form where individuals can makede-listing requests but it has continued lobbying hard against the ruling, characterizing it as censorship.One complication is that the ruling requiressearch engines to weigh up and balance any public interest before agreeing to a de-listing request, so complex value judgements are required. This means case by caseprocessing of individual requests  rather thanthe kind of algorithmic automation Google is so fond of.The principle of a search de-listing right for personal data in Europe standsin obviousopposition to Googles general business imperatives to gather as much data as possible on its users so it can improveadvert targeting. But theres anadded fight for Google with European search de-listing becauseitscurrent implementation of the law goes against the guidelines of Europes data protection watchdogs.They want Google to de-list across the Google.com domain, not just the European sub-domains as it currently is. And,earlier this month, Frances national data protection authoritytold TechCrunch itwill be requesting that Google implements worldwide de-listing  noting that it has powers to impose penalties for non-compliance by Google.The European Commission is also the process of updating and harmonizingits data protection rules  with a new data protection directive being negotiated. The new rules, which will bring strictly penalties for non-compliance, are expected to be agreed by the end of this year.
