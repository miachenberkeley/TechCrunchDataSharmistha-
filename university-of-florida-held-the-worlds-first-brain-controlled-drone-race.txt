Drone races are nothing new. Butwhilethey started as an ad-hoc activity within the drone community, the sporthas now taken on a lifeof its own with highly elaborate eventsand a partnershipwithESPN.Similarly, brain-computer interface (BCI) technology isnt totally new. And whilethe technology is still young, advances are being made in labs across the country, and some paralyzedpatients have already been able to use the technology to control prosthetic limbs.But utilizing thisBCI technology to connect your brain to a drone? That is definitely new.Last week, University of Florida did this for the first time by usingBCI software to control a group of DJI Phantom drones.And while the drones didnt exactly zoom by, 16 pilots used their brainwaves to flydrones down a 10-yard indoor course.Fair warning, the racing itself is fairlymundane.But who cares because they are drones controlled by YOUR BRAIN!So how exactly does this tech work?Pilots donelectroencephalogram headsetsthat are calibrated to each wearers brain.For example, neuron activity will be recorded when the wearer is told to think about pushing somethingforward. This activity is then bound tothe forward stickon the drones controller, so future similar neuron activity will move the drone forward.Essentially, its the same thing as when you bind new keyboard commands whenplaying a video game for the first time, just using brain waves instead of keyboard keys.As you can tell from the video, brain-controlled drones arent exactly ready for the raceway. But as the technology progresses, expect to see BCI start to integrate itself into our daily activities and lives.
