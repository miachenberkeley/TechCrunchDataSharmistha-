Up All Night, a startup aiming to give your nightlife a boost, is announcing that it has raised $500,000 in seed funding.More exciting than the amount of the funding is whos involved: Grammy-nominated musician Kaskade, Nihal Mehta of ENIAC Ventures, former Square CTO Bob Lee and Vijay Chattha, founder of marketing agency VSC.The founding team should know events and music pretty well  Chris Smith was also the founder of Om Records (Kaskade was previously an artist with the label), while CEO Prem Kumta founded the creative agency Flavor Group, which has produced events for brands like Samsung and Red Bull.Kumta told me that with Up All Night, theyre trying to solve the evergreen problem of discovery and getting into cool events. More concretely, Up All Night users pay a $25 subscription fee, which gets them into four events from the companys curated list each month. The company also createsits own events, including the monthly Electric Sheep at The Battery in San Francisco.Up All Night isnt the only service offering concert access for a subscription fee. When I brought Jukely, Kumta said, The key differentiator is the sort of content we offer and the high touch. Theyre in the sort of rock space  the kind of event they typically offer is a really cool band that youre going to see on a Tuesday. We have deals with bigger sorts of venues.The service first launched in January of 2015, introducing the subscription model in June. Kumta said its on-track to bring in seven-figure revenue this year.The company is currently limited to San Francisco, where it has deals with more than 50 venues and promoters, but it plans to launch in four new markets this year (it isnt saying which ones yet). And its introducing new messaging features that allow those venuesto offer special deals to concert-goers.
