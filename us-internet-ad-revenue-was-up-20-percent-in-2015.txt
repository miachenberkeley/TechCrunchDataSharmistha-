The online advertising industry continued a six-year streak of double-digit growth, according to a new report prepared by PwC US for the Interactive Advertising Bureau.The report found that digital ad revenue in the United States reached $59.6 billion in 2015, a 20 percent increase from the previous year and an all-time high. Sherrill Mane, the IABs senior vice president of research, analytics and measurement, suggested that this growth is particularly impressive considering the fact that the IAB has been releasing these reports for the past 20 years.For a business to be at this stage in its evolution to be growing annually in double digits  is quite remarkable, she said.Much of that growth is happening in newer areas like mobile, which increased 66 percent to $20.7 billion. Video ad revenue grew 30 percent to $4.2 billion, while social media ads were up 55 percent, to $10.9 billion.So whileventure capitalistsand the public markets may have turned unenthusiastic towards ad-tech, advertisers are still eager to spend their money online.Theres also been concern that the shift to mobile means a smaller pie of ad dollars for publishers, but PwC US partner David Silverman said, I think the pie grows as you move into new channels  particularly as advertisers become more concerned with reaching consumers on any device, so the distinction becomes less and less relevant.Even during the last recession, ad spending dipped in 2009, but it bounced back the next year and has been growing ever since.Mane acknowledged that theres plentyto be uncertain about, but she said, Lets assume everything is reasonably known and stable, then the likelihood that this growth will continue is very high for 2016.
