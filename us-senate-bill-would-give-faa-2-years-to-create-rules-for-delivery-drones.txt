The U.S.Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation today approved the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)reauthorization bill.In an amendment to thebill filed by Senators Heller and Cantwell, the Senate committee instructs the FAA to create rules for delivery drones within the next two years.Its worth noting that the bill is still working its way through the Senate and should hit the floor for a final vote next month.While the original version of the reauthorization bill left much to be desired for commercial drone operators, this amendment asks the FAA to create a set of rules that would allow Amazon, Google and others to use drones for delivery purposes.Not later than 2 years after the data of enactment of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a final rule authorizing the carriage of property by operators of small unmanned aircraft systems for compensation or hire within the United States, the amendment reads.Thanks @SenDeanHeller @SenatorCantwell for championing #drone delivery amendment in FAA bill. Great for future @Amazon #PrimeAir customers!

The amendment also calls for this certificate to beperformance-based and safety-focused.For the most part, this is whatAmazon, Google and othersthat want to get into the drone delivery game have beenrequesting.Amazons proposal, for example, would create different tiers of drones based on their on-board safety features. Only thosethatcan fly in a fully autonomous modewould be allowed for delivery operations, for example.
