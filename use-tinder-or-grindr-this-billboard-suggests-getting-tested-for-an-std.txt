Id like to point out that there is no scientific evidence saying that just using the apps Tinder or Grindr will cause an STD. However, what happens after using those apps as partially intended may.The site FreeSTDCheck.org and AIDS Health Foundation is leveraging the popularity of these dating apps to get the word out about getting yourself checked out for a sexually transmitted disease. The billboard below, spotted at La Brea just off the 10 in LA, is quite jarring. Basically, it did the job of getting our attention.Did u accidentally catch the Tinder from someone? Take this test and know for sure. pic.twitter.com/JUMjYmGQrw jenka (@babiejenks) September 27, 2015The site prominently features the widely discussed Vanity Fair article Tinder and the Dawn of the Dating Apocalypse which kicked off the most insane brand meltdown on Twitter of all time.Is it fair to call out Tinder and Grindr? Definitely not, but I guess its too late now. It worked though, because we got the message.Remember, safety first. Protect yourselves and get tested often. Also, dont carry a smart phone without a case on it.Be careful out there people, apps are full of STDs. That only sure way to avoid them is appstinence. https://t.co/wCHjO3Is7J Startup L.
