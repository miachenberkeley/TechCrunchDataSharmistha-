With sky-high rents on both housing and commercial office space, do you really have to be in the Bay Area to hit a home run? A number of VCs today at TechCrunch Disrupt said not necessarily.Dana Settle, who co-founded Greycroft Partners said that 82 percent of the firms investments have been outside Silicon Valley, including bets like Maker Studios, a Culver City-based company that was acquired by Disney for up to $1 billion.Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures gave some qualified advice. I think it depends. If you are based in Austin, New York or Boston and youve already got a network where you have a recruiting advantage, it might make sense to stay there.However, she said that the San Francisco Bay Area is better for tapping into other skillsets. If you need some expertise, the Bay Area is still quantitatively the best. The panel said that the higher you go in terms of growing a large company, the more the management expertise youll need to source from the countrys biggest tech capitals.Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners added that recruiting is also a huge component of what makes a city attractive to tech.If youre in a global city where people are willing to move  New York counts, LA counts  Austin is on the edge  it has livability stuff that makes it very attractive, but it doesnt have the same ecosystem for what people do next and thats something that people care about, Liew said. Really thats the key question. If you cant attract people that are willing to move to your city, then you have to move your headquarters to somewhere else.Its a key question for founders today as San Francisco has added more than 100,000 employed residents over the past five years, but fewer than 10,000 housing units. Thats pushed rents in the area to north of $3,530 for a 1-bedroom apartment and office rents to around $70 per square foot. All of this makes running a Silicon Valley tech company quite pricey.
