Editors Note: Christine Magee is an editorfor CrunchBase.AsUber continues on its quest to cornertheglobal ride-hailingmarketplace, venture investors in search of the next billion dollar mobility unicornhave found a new place to park capital  literally.Just thisweek, bothon-demand valet service Valet Anywhere and parking ticket combatant Fixedannounced new seedfunding. And Russian Internet giant Yandexlaunched its own Yandex.Parking servicein Moscow yesterday.Parking is more than an inconvenience  its a $25 billion dollar market in the U.S. alone, andwith supply dwindling new solutions are necessary.In all major cities in the U.S., specifically New York and LA,mostdevelopment thats happening is getting rid of thelots and building high rises, says Robert Kao, founder of Valet Anywhere.There are more and more cars being driven and less and less parking spaces  its going to be a big, big problem.Problems associated with parking are about more than just wastedtime, according toUrban.us, a Miami-based seed stage investment firm focused on tacklingurban challenges.Our broad interest is things that make cities better, and parking is relevant to us because it directly intersects with congestion and ultimately emissions, says founder Shaun Abrahamson.Depending on the estimates, 30% of traffic ispeople just driving around to look for parking spaces.Abrahamson is not alone. According to CrunchBase data, parking tech has quite a few VCs excited even rapper Nas got in on this weeks round for Fixed.In 2014, CrunchBase captured$76 million in capital committed for parking tech companiesand saw a 40% jump in number of venture roundsrecorded the year before.I think the interest is all over the map because people are looking at Uber and going, OK, we have some massive disruption of a traditional business, so what else is interesting in the mobility space?' saysAbrahamson.New Yorks Valet Anywhere and San FranciscosLuxe Valetand Zirxhave tailored the rather trendy Uber for parking model to fit regional markets,but weve yet to see a nation-wide winner. Fordrivers whod rather park themselves, thereare a handful ofparking search and comparison engines such asSpotHeroout of Chicago, Spot Park in Boston, andQuickPayin the Bay Area.Ultimately, there will need to be some consolidation. When we look at the space we assume there will be more and more integration, to the point where eventuallyalllead gen is going to happen at the mapping layer, whether its bike share or Car2Goor ZipCar or whatever, Abrahamson says.We probably wont be seeing a second$40 billion dollar mobility giantanytime soon, but theres an open spot in the parking market for a newtech titan.Image via Flickr user Ken Hawkins.
