Harry Stebbings is the founder and host of The Twenty Minute VC
, an independent podcast focused on venture capital. From its roots in the private equity world of the 1980s, venture capital in Europe has always operated somewhat differently from its counterparts in the U.S.In this episode of the 20 Minute VC, we catch up with James Wise, a longtime contributor who is making his bow with us as Balderton Capitals youngest early stage venture partner, and who has plenty to say about how venture capitalin Europe needs to evolve.Of the 500 funds operating across Europe today, Wise says many of them still think like the private equity firms from which they sprang. An approach, he says, thats ill-suited to ventures early stage risk-taking.The financial modeling at the heart of a financiers skillset in private equity or banking cant be applied to nascent companies that are little more than an idea.Rather, Wise argues that venture firms across Europe need to create a more diverse team if theyre going to be successful company builders and partners with the entrepreneurs they back.Wise also argues for diversity in a funds investment strategy as well as its personnel. While individual investors may specialize in a particular segment, a fund needs to be broadly diversified, says Wise. Its an insight that flies in the face of the recent fragmentation of the venture business in the U.S. and Europe where firms are segmenting themselves by stage, geography, and industry.
