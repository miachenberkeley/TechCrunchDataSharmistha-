VetTechTrek is a nonprofitfounded last year with the goal of helpingmilitary veterans network with the technology industry.Over thelast 12 months they have worked toward this goal by hosting multiple treks that brought more than 180 veterans and spouses to meet with veterans who work atmore than 60 technology startups in New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, DC. Some companies have included Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook andY Combinator.While feedback was great, the nonprofit became overwhelmed with requests from both veterans and companieswanting to participate.So today VetTechTrek is launching Project Standard, an e-learning platform that will house a library of resourcestohelp veterans build great post-military careers. Essentially,the nonprofit plans to help veterans with anything that can helptranslate their military experiences to stories and skills that make sense for hiring managers and founding teams.These lessons will be broken down into content based on Companies, Topics and Roles.The Companiesportion will function likevideo-based treks to replicate the experienceof their in-person events. The other two sections will focus on helping veterans with things like resume development, networking and other topics relevant to transitioning service members.To build the platform, VetTechTrek just launched a Kickstarter to raise $50,000, which will be used to pay pre- and post-production crews to film about 100 Netflix-quality instructional videos.But why use Kickstarter to raise funding when the nonprofit could presumably easily fundraise from the over 60 companiesthat have already supported theinitiative?VetTechTrek explains that they wanted to validate without a shadow of a doubt that theyre building something that veterans actually want.The nonprofit was started by Steve Weiner and Mike Slagh, two navy veterans who nowwork in the tech industry in San Francisco.While the group will continue running a few in-person treks each year, the majority of the nonprofits resources will be dedicated to thenew e-learning platform.You can check out their Kickstarter here, which will be live for three more weeks, and has already raised $12,000 out of their $50,000 goal.
