VHX, a startup that helpscustomers sell videos online, is taking a big leap into mobile, with new capabilities for publishers to launch their own custom apps.While the startup is officially announcing those capabilities today, as part of its presence at the Consumer Electronics Show, it actually released its first apps back in November. By creating Apple TV apps for Black&SexyTV and Yoga With Adriene, Head of Product Casey Pugh said VHX could give people a little sneak peek and also take advantage of the excitement around the new Apple TV.VHX previously offered mobile access to video content through the VHX app, but now publishers can include the VHX-powered content in apps of their own.CEO Jamie Wilkinson said thats particularly important if a businesswants to move to a subscription model  most publishers using VHX currently offertheir content transactionally (you buy one video at a time), but for the ones thathave a significant library of content, he suggested that subscriptions are sort of an inevitable user experience optimization.VHX says it will handle the entire development process, and theapps will work on devices including Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, Android, Roku and Chromecast.
