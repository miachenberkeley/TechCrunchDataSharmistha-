Victorious, a startup building mobile apps where YouTube stars can interact with their superfans, says the strategy seems to be paying off.Specifically, since the first apps launched in April, theyve seen a total of 250 million views and 300 million engagements, with fans creating 1 million pieces of user-generated content.In addition, Victorious says that it has now signed deals with creators who reach a total of 350 million subscribers on YouTube. New partners include theDOMINICshow, Complex Media and The Whistle.Those might sound a bit like vanity metrics, especially since Victorious declined to provide a count of daily active users across its apps. However, co-founder and chief creative officer Bing Chen noted that subscriber count is a common way to show the reach of the multi-channel networks that help video publishers make money.Chen also argued that the numbers counter the assumption that digital content isa zero sum game. Instead, the apps have a symbiotic relationship with big video platforms  video creators can collect UGC through their apps, repackage and publish it on anchor platforms like YouTube, then use that content to drive follow-up conversations within the app.In an emailstatement, Mehrotra said:Years ago, we deliberately moved from videos to channels at YouTube. Naturally, you always wonder: whats next? Passionate communities were always the piece that got me most excited. Superfans engage in more interesting ways with content than casual fans, express themselves through their own premium content, and are the lifeblood of creators and creative communities. Its been rewarding to see something Ive cared about so deeply for yearspassionate communitiesemerge on Victorious as the start of a next generation passion platform.Update: An earlier version of the headline incorrectly stated that Victorious was claiming 200 million views.
