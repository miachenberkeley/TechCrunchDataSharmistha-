Startup Vilynxpitches itself as a wayfor publishers to attract more eyeballs for their videos through a unique preview format. Now its trying help those publishers make money, too, through advertising.The exact look of the previews can vary, but the basic idea is that instead of just usingstatic thumbnail images, Vilynx creates a five-second video preview that can, for example, start playing when you mouse over the video. In theory, creating these previews might not seem that hard, but it can quickly become annoying or impossible once youre dealing with enough videos.Co-founder and CEO Juan Carlos Riveiro told me that under the hood, Vilynxs technology can automatically pull an engaging clip, and will continue responding to data, changing the clip over time to maximize viewer engagement.Vilynx says it can triple video play rates and improve engagement by 6x. Riveiro said publishers were also asking if theres a way to make money from those previews. He didnt exactly oppose it, but he didnt want to do it in a way that would annoy viewers after all, he noted that on mobile, consumers can be particularly sensitive to watching unwanted videos, since they see it as not just a waste of time but also bandwidth.To solve that, Vilynx is applying its existing technology to determine where the ads (which will only be a few seconds long, like the previews themselves) will actually run  they should only appear when consumers are likely to respond. Riveiro compared his approach to Facebook and Twitter,which can also adjust ad placement and frequency to respond to user engagement.We can implement those kind of algorithms to make sure we not upsetting anybody and its not a constant interruption, Riveirosaid.In addition, Vilynx will check to ensurethat the video being previewed doesnt comewith a video ad. In other words, you shouldnthave the experience of watching one ad before you click and have to watch another ad.As part of the announcement, Vilynx managed to snag an approving quote from Daniel Tibbets, chief content officer of video companyMachinima, who said in the product press release, Vilynx does a great job driving increased video play rates with their preview technology, and now publishers have a new revenue stream with the Vilynxs in-line ad solution for browsing videos.These ads arent live yet, but you can see some sample Vilynx previews here and here.Vilynx co-founder Chris Acosta added that the company isnt trying to get into the ad sales business. Instead, itsoffering this as an additive layer to our platform for customers and partners, including Comcast-owned thePlatform.
