Vimeo is furtheringits investment in original programming, the company announced this morning with the unveiling of the video networks second slate of programs and films. The new batch includes the companys first-ever feature film as well as its first concert film, representing an expansion in terms of the type of content it aims to host on its service.The announcement follows rival YouTubes launch of its own originals last month, which included a new PewDiePie show, plus three exclusive movies. YouTubes programs were made available via YouTube Red, the companys newer, ad-free subscription service.However, unlike YouTube, which aims to attract a younger fanbase whos morefamiliar with YouTube stars than traditional Hollywood actors, Vimeo aims for a slightly older crowd, as is evidenced by its selection of original programming.For example, Vimeos first original documentary and first feature-length film, Wizard Mode, offers viewers a personal perspective on autism by telling the story of one of the worlds greatest pinball players. Meanwhile, its first concert film features indie chillwave pioneer Toro y Moi.These choices dont exactly scream young teenage audience wanted.Anotheraddition to the lineup includes another adult-oriented program from CollegeHumors Jake Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld (Jake and Amir) called Lonely and Horny. Its title alone speaks to the fact that Vimeo is not after the PewDiePie demographic here.Also arriving is a comedy special called Garfunkel and Oates: Trying to be Special, featuring the comedy-folk duoRiki Lindhome and Kate Micucci, who have done a TV series for IFC, a web series, multiple albums, concert tours, and music videos. Again, this is for the grown-ups,given the comedians topics of choice in the past.All four programs will premiere on Vimeo this year at staggered times, beginning in April, and will be available for rent or purchase.The company also today announced the premiere date for season two of its original series The Outs, which features 20-something gay men struggling with life andfinding love in the city. It will debutnew episodes starting onMarch 30th.The unveilingof the new series and filmscomes shortly after Vimeo upgraded its mobile app for iOS with a focus on finding videos on its network, including its originals. The apps revamped interface now organizes videos into categories, like Music, Documentary, Travel and others choices that reflect Vimeos desire todistance itselffrom being a home to personal videos, and to better reflect its higher-quality content from indie creators, writers, directors, and more.Previously, it was reported that Vimeo was planning to spend at least $10 million on content in 2016. Though the company didnt talk numbers in todays announcement, it did say that its new shows represent a significant investment in original programming.
