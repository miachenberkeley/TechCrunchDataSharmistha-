Vine is a never-ending series of inside jokes. Every day, some weird video or audio clip becomes the trend and everyone races to make their own remix. Now you can play along without any extra editing tools with Vines new audio remix button. Just tap the three-dot more button below any Vine, hitMake an audio remix, and you can then shoot or upload a video with the original Vines audio pre-loaded.For example, its easy to turn the instant classic Why you always lying? song:Into Why you always lion?:To ensure creators get credited, Vine will link remixes back to the originals. Youll also be able to click any Vine to see a feed full of its remixes as a way to discover more clips to watch. You can also search by audio to find clips that feature specific sounds. The new audio remix creator is out today on iOS, and the discovery tools are now available on iOS and Android.Heres how the audio remix tool works:The launch is part of Vines attempt to get more users involved in creation. Over the years, the platform has become less of a user generated content tool and more a broadcast medium for a small handful of popular Viners. This oligarchy largely rules the Popular and Comedy channels with their skits and monologues that receive millions of loops. Meanwhile, normal users struggle to gain followers, and end up just watching rather than posting videos into the dark.Here, Vine seems to have accepted that not everyone can make 100% original videos worth seeing. But its much easier for an average user to create a remix people will enjoy.Instead of requiring complicated outside editing tools to make these, which erects a barrier to participation, Vine is building more remix and creation tools into its own app. Thats why it launched the Snap-To-Beat looping tool in August. If Vine doesnt get more people creating, viewers might get board with the same crowd of Popular page celebrities, and move on to more lively platforms like Snapchat.
