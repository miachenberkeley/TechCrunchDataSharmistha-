Mike Hoefflinger is an Executive-in-Residence at XSeed Capital and was previously at Facebook and Intel. With each of the six biggest global consumer technology companies now deeply invested and feverishly in development, VR/ARhas become too big to fail.FacebookOculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR (powered by Oculus),GoogleCardboard and itsMagic Leap investment (and perhaps even Google Glass second coming),SonyPlayStationVRandMicrosoft HoloLens are public. And the eventual entry ofAppleis presumed, givenhiring headlinesand Tim Cooks pronouncement thatVRisnota niche.However, as much as 2016willsee the launches of the bestVR/ARto date (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStationVR), this generation of hardware  notportable and tethered to a bulky PC or console  is merely intended for millions of early adopter enthusiasts consisting mostly of gamers.Oculus Rift consumer edition headset with positional tracker and controllerThe devices thatwillturnVR/ARinto an interface for hundreds of millionswillblend into our lives much more easily. To do that, theywillembrace the one device that rules them all the smartphone  and in doing so, pull it out ofitsstagnation.Theywilllook and feel much like ordinary glasses,featuring clear lenses with built-in waveguides transmitting the output of tiny projectors on each arm across the entire surface of each lens, covering a 120-degree field of view with 60-90 frame-per-second 1080p video (960 x 1080 resolution for each eye) delivered wirelessly by your phone. In the out-yearsit iseven possible the projection + waveguide combinationwillbe replaced with beyond-retina-level transparent edge-to-edge LCDs in each lens.Theyll have the ability to go from being completely clear to displaying images that augment what you see (AR) to displaying images that cover the lenses edge-to-edge (VR), andwillleverage next-generation phones for all the computing necessary.While these displayswillsacrifice some image quality and the perfect sense of virtual reality presence that large, fully enclosed head-mounted displays tethered to PCs can deliver, theywillsuffice for the vast majority of popularVR/AR applications and be dramatically easier to wear and carry, driving much greater volume than high-end HMDs.The technical requirements here are deceptively steep, and have to do with everything from making the round-trip from the nine-way head-tracking sensors and dual cameras on the glasses to the phone for re-computing the image, to sending the uncompressed resulting video back to the glasses wirelessly at multi-gigabit-per-second speeds, to refreshing the projection in the lenses all in 20-30 millisecondsto prevent the motion-to-photon lag that causesVRdiscomfort.In addition, the requirements to miniaturize the components on the glasses to give them the rough weight, portability and style of the glasses youre used to are serious.Although these hurdles cannot be met in 2016, early prototypes of everything requiredwillexist this year (see the likes ofLumusin-glass projection modules,WHDImulti-Gb/s wireless HDMI point-to-point transmission and ApplesA9Xprocessors), making 2018 consumer products plausible.With this approach, the glasses benefit from the portability, connectivity, computing, touch and voice control the phone can deliver, and the phone benefits from the display options (bigger than any display you use today; virtual 120 television set for Netflix anyone?) and new applications the glasses make possible (spherical and 3D spherical photos and video, and the kind of casualVRentertainment thatustwo,Resolution GamesandOculus Story Studioare pioneering).This is whyVR/ARwillnotbe a competitive platform to mobile, but an interface and ability extension of it, and therefore ademanddriver.Google Cardboard AppHow big can this medium on top of a medium get? Looking at the market for tablets may be instructive as an upper bound, as prices ($500-$800)  and to a lesser degree use cases  are similar:Taking out 2-in-1s from the tablet installed-base projection (as it is a different, more general purpose, use case), and cutting the remainder in half because glasses maynotgo as far into the low end as tablets, an installed base of more than 500 million units for glasses by 2026 is plausible. Thats roughly twice as big as video game consoles and half as big as tablets.If things go in this direction, heres how it may play out for The Big Six:Apple.Wades into the premium part of the market for glasses in late 2018, paired with the iPhone 8, whichwill have the necessary processing and wireless communication to be the furnace for the glasses (and may extend the rumored multi-lens system of the iPhone 7 to be capable of the spherical and spherical 3D photos and videos that shine on glasses).The glasseswillhelp withdemandfor iPhone and bring new life to the $499-$799 price points occupied by iPads, which have flat-lined. For extra credit, Apple Glasses 2willplay well with Apple Car 1 (~2020).Projection: Majority of category profits  again.Google.Willcontinue to lead the way on breadth with Cardboard, but these 2-3 minute experiences are low-end tasters. Theyll compete on the high end (paired with Android phones) with some combo of Magic Leap and/or a revived Google Glass as the Nexus showpieces of the segment.Projection: Platform for volume  again.Facebook.On the hardware side, Oculuswillpair with both Google Android and Apple iPhone, bifurcatingits product line into high-end true presence tethered headsets and more mainstream glasses with Oculus Rift 3 in 2018. On the software side, well access the vast majority ofVR/ARcontent (photos, videos, games) through one or more of Facebooks services, as we do for flatland content today.Projection: Our portal(s) to the world  again.Samsung.Partners with Google and Facebook to play defense.Projection: Volume hardware, low profits  again.Sony.Wades in early with PlayStationVRand sticks with it. Projection: Wins the second-division battle (e.g., consoles)  again.Microsoft.Trying to throw the ball downfield the farthest and the earliest with the standalone HoloLens headset (everything is on-board, including processing) that is neither fish (high-endVR) nor fowl (portable).Projection: Impressive, butnotwinning, technology  again.The more things change, the more they stay the same.
