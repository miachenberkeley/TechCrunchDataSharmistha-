Visual.ly, a startup that helps companies create infographics, videos, and more, has raised $3.3 million in additional funding.The company launched with an infographic-building tool before switching to more of a marketplace model  by the time it raised its $8.1 million Series A last year, Visual.ly was billing itself a marketplace for visual content, a category that also includesvideos and interactive graphics.CEO Matt Cooper told me that company has continued to expand and now covers things like e-books and white papers. He tied this to the broader growth in content marketing  in other words, brands desire to produce blog posts, videos, and so onin an attempt to connect with consumers. (Content marketing is far from universally beloved, but at least its a broader category than just infographics, and its certainly an area where VC dollars are flowing.)Theres this constant demand to feed that beast, and its really taxing to internal marketing departments to keep up with that flow, he said. The rise of content marketing been a primary driver in our business growth.Cooper, by the way, joined Visual.ly last fall. (Co-founder and former CEO Stew Langille is now at Fountain Software.) He was previously an executive at oDesk, and he drew parallels between the two companies experience in building freelance marketplaces.Visual.ly stands out, Cooper added, because of its focus on the quality of the end product, the fact that its built the best practices of overseeing a creative project into its technology, and its rigorously vetted talent pool. (The company doesnt say exactly how many freelancers it works with, but Cooper said its in the thousands.)The new funding is an extension of the Series A, and comes from Visual.lys existing investors  it was led by Crosslink with participation from 500 Startups, the Mitch Kapor Foundation and SoftTech VC.
