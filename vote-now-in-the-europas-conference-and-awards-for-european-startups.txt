In partnership with TechCrunch, The Europas Conference & Awards, which I founded, has come up with a new kind of tech conference. Think of it as a relaxed, summer prelude to the heat of a Disrupt, followed by an all-out celebration of startups. Admittedly, its how we like to do things in EuropeThe Europas includes a public vote to determine the industrys favorites.Thus, voting has now gone live, so click here to start voting.This is the final short list from which the winners will be chosen by a combination of industry votes and judges (also speakers at the day-time conference) and announced at an evening awards ceremony.You can grab tickets here.The awards are supported by TechCrunch, the official and exclusive media partner. Attendees, nominees and winners will get deep discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in London, later this year.Held annually, The Europas are the main European Awards for technology startups. The whole thing comes together on a special awards night in London, on June 14, which is preceded by a smaller scale, but intimate, conference where there is no VIP list and plenty of amazing discussions between founders and investors.Of course, out of the sheer need to filter the thousands of people in tech startups across Europe, the Awards cant cover every single startup, investor and entrepreneur. But its a selection of amongst the best Europe has to offer. The awards are editorially led, with many nominated and others suggested by judges.There is no charge to enter or be selected or to win. (There is only a charge to attend the awards ceremony, but its a super fun event for the whole industry).So get voting!Best Media/Entertainment StartupDubsmash -Choose a a sound, record yourself, send to your friends.Jukedeck  Jukedeck is developing an artificially intelligent music composer.Car Throttle  Car Throttle is the internets fastest growing car community.Encore  The fastest way to find and book great musicians.Touchvie  Touchvie brings context to content.Grabyo  Real-time TV and video clip sharing.TV Player  The best of UK television all in one place.Best E-Commerce StartupDeliverooGoustoBizdaqBloom & WildZalandoDesk BeersForterLost My NameBest Education StartupPeakKahootKuato StudiosMemriseOverleaf busuuBlinkistMemoradoResearchGateBest Startup AcceleratorEntrepreneur FirstCyLon (Cyber London)Startup BootcampMassChallenge UKTechstars LondonWAYRAL39Oxygen AcceleratorIgniteForward PartnersTheFamilyH-FARMBeta-IBest Advertising/Marketing StartupSimilarWebS4MAdludioEyeteaseBuzzoolePixoneyeQuintlyBest Games StartupSeriously.comGoodgame StudiosQuantic DreamUsTwoHello GamesBrainbowSupercellSpace Ape GamesBest Mobile StartupFeverAircallHappnThingthingEyeEmGrabbleWallapopBlipparWireBest Fintech StartupCurveGoCardlessYoYo WalletiwocaRevolutWorld RemitFunding CircleMondo BankSplittableEburyLendInvestOrmsby StreetBest Enterprise, SaaS or B2B StartupOnfidoMainframejobandtalent LystableMOVE GuidesForter ProdPad iZettleKlarnaBest Hardware StartupSphericamMicro DroneVector WatchRobo Wunderkind MysteryVibe KokoonBraille PadBlazeTechnology Will Save UsBest Sharing Economy StartupJustParkBlaBlaCarCat in a FlatStudent.comLove Home SwapWeroomDRIVYBorrowMyDoggyBest Health StartupClueTouch SurgeryLifesumKlarismoBaby2BodyYour.MDQinec CalmBest Cybersecurity StartupCyberX BehavioSecFeaturespaceDarktraceArgus CyberFabricUkkoboxBitninjaDigital ShadowsBest Blockchain Startup of the YearCreditsProvenanceSlock.itStamperySetlClearmatics TramonexSatoshipayBest Travel StartupBlacklaneStratajetVictorTeleportSnaptripFamily TravellerMasabiSecret EscapesGettBest Internet of Things StartupSigfoxEVRYTHNGOWLRHUB ControlsKontaktRelayrWithingsCoolest Technology InnovationBragi (The Dash)KlarismoUltrahapticsYetiInfltrBasslet by LofeltBlaze BurnerBest Fashiontech StartupThreadChic by ChoiceFarfetchVinayaVideDressingMall zeeSnapsBest Angel/Seed Investor of the YearFederico Pirzio-BiroliSarah TurnerRussell BuckleyGabbi CahaneJeremy Yap Richard FearnRichard ReedPeter ReadYenyun K.
