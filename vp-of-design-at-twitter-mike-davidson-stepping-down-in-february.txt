According to a tweet from Mike Davidson, Twitter is about to lose its Vice President of Design::) To be a little more clear, I am leaving @Twitter permanently, but it will always be with me! Mike Davidson (@mikeindustries) December 15, 2015No other information was given on whats next for him or where Twitter will look for design direction.With nothing sacred at Twitter as far as changes to features and design, perhaps the company will go fast and loose without need for this particular high-level spot.Weve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update if we hear more.
