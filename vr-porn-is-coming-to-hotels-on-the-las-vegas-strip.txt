Sin City is about to get a bit more sinful, as VR content platform VR Bangers and headset maker AuraVisor are teaming up to offer in-room adult experiences (via virtual reality) at hotels on the strip in Las Vegas.What makes this partnership particularly interesting is that users who purchase the in-room AuraVisor will be viewing content that was filmed in a hotel room that looks similar to the one where theyre staying, making the fantasy that much more immersive.Interested hotel guests simply pay $20 on their credit card to have an AuraVisor headset in the room. This headset is pre-loaded with sexy-time content, and all the user has to do is specify the preferred gender of their virtual partner.As Engadget points out, the partnership with AuraVisormakes sense as the Indiegogo- and Kickstarer-funded project is its own standalone headset, using Googles Android software. That means that hotel guests wont have to do anything with their own smartphones in order to use the AuraVisor.Porn is undoubtedly one of the main predicted use-cases for virtual reality technology, but this implementation of such a thing has its own obstacles. For one, hygiene. Anything worn on the head or face should be properly sanitized before being shared. But on top of that, theres the matter of dirty hands, etc. to deal with.That said, theres no place like Las Vegas to play fast and loose with keeping clean.Its unclear which hotels will roll out the platform, but well keep you abreast of the situation.
