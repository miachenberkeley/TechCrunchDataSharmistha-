Visual Supply Co., better known as VSCO, has acquired Artifact Uprising, a Denver-based startup focused on bringing photographers work from the digital hubs frequented by modern creatives to the real world as tangible books and prints.In a chat last night, VSCO CEO Joel Florytold TechCrunch that the deal is about helping Artifact Uprising achieve its potential. As a photographer, theres nothing quite like holding a print of your photo, he noted while describing how Artifact Uprisings offeringswill fit into VSCOs current product line-up, which today focuses ongiving photographers tools for editing and sharingphotos ontheir phones and desktops.Flory says that Artifact Uprising is already doing a fantastic job at providing a product for photographers, but will be able to leverage VSCOs resources to grow further. Thats why all of Artifact Uprisings 14 full-time team members will retain their positions post-merger, including founder Jenna Walker, who will stay on as CEO and continue to operate mostly independently.Leveraging VSCOs resources isnt just a reference to the $40 million VSCO raised inits Series A round last May, however. On the engineering side of things, we have our own goals and aspirations in this space. Were building out the architecture and platform behind that, which will be a shared resource, rolled out piece-by-piece over the course of 2015.VSCO will also help Artifact Uprising move beyond North America, which is currently its primary market. VSCO has it the other way around, with 80% of its user base located outside the United States.
