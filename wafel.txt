About a week ago, the Google Photos team shared this mystical and magical video about a waffle wafel. What could it mean? What is this all about?Why a waffle??!?!?!Well, Google Photos is deploying food trucks in New York City to get some help on fine tuning its technologyand for marketing as well, Im sure. Its summer time, so companies have to get out and about to get their goods in front of those on vacation.When you do these kinds of on the ground things, you get to demo your product to people who wouldnt necessarily have known about it. Food trucks always get peoples attention, so its tried-and-true genius. In essence: try our product, get some free food.Here are some of the locations that the Photos team plan on hitting up:Do you have what it takes to get the large wafel? Come find us this week and find out. #paywithaphoto pic.twitter.com/IykZR9Zn6p Google Photos (@googlephotos) July 29, 2015Searched for a photo, got a waffle:Just had the BEST WAFFLE EVER and I paid for it with a photo!
