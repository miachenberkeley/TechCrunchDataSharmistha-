Sometimes a designer can get sucked so deeply into a project that they dont even really know whether it looks good or not anymore.Feedback is an essential, yet strangelycomplicated, part of the design process.Wake, which is launching publicly today, aimsto allow designers a more effective way to share their works-in-progress and get feedback from their teams.The product, which consists of Mac, iOS and web apps allows design teams to instantly review what others are working on, share their thoughts and get back to their own projects without weaving through dozens of office workflow tools orwandering to fellow designers desks.Wake launched a private beta of their productin February. Since then, the team has been rapidly building to accommodate all of the interest from design teamsitching to simplify their workflows.Wake has been hard at work scaling its business in the meantime as well. The company raised a $750K round earlier this summerfrom First Round, Slow Ventures, Designer Fund and others.The startup is currently servicing about 900 companies. This includes some high-profile names likeAirbnb, Artsy and Medium that have inserted the toolinto their design processes.Dustin Senos, head of design at Medium, said in a release that Wake has filled the gap between formal design reviews at Medium in a collaborative and lightweight way. It has increased transparency, continuity, and communication during our design process.It generally takes a designer to solve a designers problem.Chris Kalani, CEO and co-founder of Wake, says that since the beta launch in the winter, the team has spent a lot of time observing usage and trying to improve the amount of time it takes for a team to get on, invite people, upload things and just have them engage with the product.As with most of the products that designers have beenusing Wake to work on, Kalani, who previously worked as a product designer at Facebook where he helped buildproducts like Messenger and Graph Search, says that keeping the tool intuitive is pretty critical.We didnt want users to have to think about it at all. Just take a snapshot of what youre working on and share.
