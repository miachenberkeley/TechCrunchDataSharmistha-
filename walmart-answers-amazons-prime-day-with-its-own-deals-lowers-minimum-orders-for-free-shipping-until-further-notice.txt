Walmart today announced its intentionsto take the wind out of the sails of Amazons upcoming Prime Day, a one-day event happening on July 15th which will offer Black Friday-like sales and savings for Prime subscribers in nine countries, including the U.S.Walmarts own membership-based savings programcalled ShippingPass, an Amazon Prime competitor of sorts, is still in limited trials, so instead thecompany has responded to Prime Day bydropping the minimum orderrequirements to qualify for free shipping across the board, as well as plans to offer its own discounted products.Beginningtoday, customers only have to order $35 worth of merchandise online, down from the previous requirement of $50, says Walmart.The company notesthat the free shipping requirements are being put into place until further notice, which implies that this is a lengthierpromotion, if not a permanent one. Walmart hints that it could be limited to just this summer, however, in an announcement. We understand it will last for at least 30 days.Its an interesting promotionin light of Walmarts ShippingPass service, whose value islargely based on allowing customers to save on online orders without having to first buy $50 worth of goods. ShippingPass testershave so far been able to order products across a number of categories, includingBaby, Clothing, Electronics, Health & Beauty and more, without anyorder minimums and then receive those items in three days time. Walmart had been testing the service at a price point of $50 per year  cheaper than Amazon Prime, but without the other associated Prime benefits and an extra day of shippingHowever,if Walmart decides to keepits minimum order requirement at$35 indefinitely, that could make ShippingPass less compelling to potential subscribers (assuming it goes public), as its far less difficult tobuild a $35 basket than a $50 one.In addition to the loweredorderrequirements for free shipping, Walmart is also more directly competing with Prime Day by announcing its own online deals on July 15th  a move that makes Amazons version of Black Fridayfeel more like a real Black Friday event as its now expanding to other retailers.According to Walmart, the company will begin offering thousands of rollback specials on July 15th along with some special atomic deals. The latter is Walmart lingo for special time-limited deals, but the company isnt announcing the details on either theserollbacks or the atomic deals until Wednesday. Because of that, its unclear if the retailer is offeringanything thats significantly cheaper than itstypical price drops, or if any of the dealsare designed to directly counter Amazons own upcomingspecials.Walmarts rollbacks typically last 90 days, but withthousands more being added online on Wednesday alongside the atomic deals, it will have an increased lineup of promotions on its e-commerce storefront.The company says the deals will fall in categories that are important to its customers, including electronics, home, baby and toys. Walmart isnt the only retailer to launch a response to Prime Day. FreeShipping.com today announced a July 15th cashback promotion on its site which links to over 1,000 retailers. Meanwhile, Target is hosting a Black Friday in July event this week, as well.
