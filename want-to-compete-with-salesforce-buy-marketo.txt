Vik Singh is the founder and CEO of Infer.There are several enterprise players thatwanta share ofSalesforces business, but just arent making headway by knuckling up against the companys dominant, entrenched SaaS CRM offerings. Rather than competing head on, a smarter approach for these businesses is to front doorSalesforce,instead.By acquiringMarketo, a competitor could get intoSalesforces accounts, then, over time, work themselves down the funnel and leverage better integrations withMarketoin order to eventually displaceSalesforce.Marketos strategic foothold in the enterprise and its current market value relative to potential acquirers like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and evenSalesforcemake this a great time tobuythe leading marketing automation vendor.Many industry watchers overlook the mission-critical roleMarketoplays in its customers go-to-market operations. The majority ofMarketos 4,000 customers also useSalesforce, but the marketing automation system has access to more data about the funnel than its CRM counterpart.Marketocan sync bi-directionally withSalesforce, capturing allthe data stored there, while also holding top-of-the-funnel lead behavior data that doesnt get stored in CRM. Hence, it has access to an invaluable superset of data about a companys potential and existing customers.This is the data platform for which developers shouldwantto build apps. Theres a lot of potential forMarketoto do more with its LaunchPoint platform and replicate the successSalesforcehas seen with the AppExchanges community of killer apps (includingMarketo). For example, an acquirer could tieMarketowith its cloud offerings to provide an even broader set of data (i.e.Salesforce+Marketo+ the acquirers data) and build a competing developer platform.Bundling a cloud infrastructure solution like Azure, AWS, Heroku or Google Compute with Marketowould also help the system scale better.Because marketing is multi-channel and more data-driven, companies are collecting thousands to millions of events from their website activities, which are instrumented withMarketolanding pages and forms.A better cloud environment would enable improved reporting, better performance and faster workflow triggers than you can get withtodays marketing automation systems that simply werent designed with this much data in mind. Additionally, having both a CRM andMarketoin one product portfolio would drive faster and more sizeable deals, similar to the strategy Salesforce employs with Pardot.Lets also consider the rest of the marketing automation landscape. When you compareMarketos go-to-market approach against competitors like Eloqua, Pardot and HubSpot, it has a distinct advantage.Marketois the only vendor that started out by focusing on the mid-market and is steadily moving up-market  a strategy thats been proven successful time and again by market leaders likeSalesforce, New Relic and others.Marketos competitive positioning against Eloqua has been that it is faster and slicker. While Eloqua first established the marketing automation category, and is known to be more powerful and better for complex environments (although that gap is closing), it is considered more difficult to set up thanMarketo.Its really hard for Eloqua tocompeteagainstMarketo, because offering more advanced functionality perpetuates a cycle of further complexity, but transitioning to a faster and slicker solution risks alienating big customers and power users.Marketos smart strategy has led to more deals and more customers, despite entering the market after Eloqua.At the other end of the spectrum, HubSpot focuses on selling to much smaller companies, and offers a self-service solution as opposed to deep CRM integration. Interestingly enough, HubSpot offers CRM for free with its marketing automation, which is a great way to compete against Salesforcein the lower end of the market.Of course,Salesforces Pardot offering sits somewhere in the middle. There have been many improvements to the platform, but based on what customers are saying, Pardot is still behind Marketowhen it comes to feature functionality.From a financial perspective, this would, of course, be a sizeable acquisition.Marketohas generatedhundreds of millions in revenue, and is growing 40 percent year-over-year. Despite this track record, the market is really dinging its value, which is likelybecause of the companys unprofitability, leadership changes, uncertainty around SaaS products, etc.Marketos enterprise value is currently $640 million plus $110 million in cash, and if you factor in a 25 percent premium, youre looking at a price tag of just under $1 billion.Although that certainly isnt chump change, Id argue that the market is favoring large, profitable software companies many of whom have plenty of cash for an acquisition of this nature. Marketo, on the other hand, is trading at anall-time lowof only 3x enterprise value to revenue, while otherenterprise SaaS companieslike Zendesk, New Relic andSalesforceare at 6-8x multiples, even in this market.This low multiple undervalues the strategic value ofMarketo, one of the few SaaS companies with thousands of customers on five-figure annual contracts.Marketohas one of the most extraordinary ramps weve seen sinceSalesforcein terms of year-over-year revenue, growing from $1 million to $209 million over the past 10 years. The companys incremental revenue is 2x its incremental sales and marketing spend in recent quarters (while it has also kept R&D costs roughly flat).Looking at incremental annualized billings this year over sales and marketing spend from last year,Marketos magic number is 0.54, which means that each customer pays for itself in less than two years. Itd be better to see a payback of under 12 months, because many of its contracts have annual commitments. And given the amount of upfront work there is to set up a marketing automation system, it is reasonable to assume that a Marketo customer will stay on for at least a year and roll into a second year commit  paying back their associated sales and marketing spend.According to my calculations, ifMarketodedicates more than a quarter of itssales forceto going after the enterprise, it can bring this payback down to one year, which would significantly reduce burn and improve sales efficiency. Even thoughMarketos unprofitability has grown at the same rate as revenue, the company is still only burning about $6 million a month. And when you divide its revenues by 4,000 customers, average annual contract values (ACVs) look to be around $40,000, which feels low given the scope of the platform.Marketoshould be seeing more success with moving up-market. A large acquirer with stronger footholds in big companies would help it sell into that enterprise segment. By joining forces with one of the software giants to enhance its offerings,Marketocould boost upsell rates and ACVs, as well as close its profitability gap.All of this demonstratesMarketos attractiveness as an acquisition target. If youwantto make headway in the CRM or analytics space, you need a solid marketing automation system  the ultimate gatekeeper of the funnel. Its the perfect trojan horse for tapping into CRM and co-existing withSalesforce.AMarketoacquisition could be a great defensive move forSalesforce, but it would be messy culturally, given its competing ExactTarget/Pardot products. On the other hand, companies like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are competing withSalesforcein the CRM game. If youre one of those major players, youve got to ask yourself  how often do you get an opportunity like this?
