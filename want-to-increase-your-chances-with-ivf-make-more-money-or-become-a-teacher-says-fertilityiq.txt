Money and teaching might seem at odds with one another but a study out from the Yelp for fertility treatments startup FertilityIQ found both to be the best indicators of success with IVF.FertilityIQ is one of many pregnancy-focused tech companies busy gathering new information from couples trying to conceive. While part of that information can be utilized for further research to help dispel antiquated ideas, for now, FertilityIQis focused ondiscovering which factors contribute to a higher rate of IVF success.What we know about infertility is surprisingly abysmal, especially for women in their 30s and 40s. Weve been taught womens fertility is a ticking time bomb that will drop off a cliff after 35 (ha ha,um, no).The warnings can strike panic and cause couples to seek unnecessarytreatment or the wrong treatment.But a lot of these popularly recited ideas about middle-aged women and baby-making actually comes from research done in the 1700s!On top of worry and murky info, fertility treatments are expensive  $12,000 on average per cycle, with the likelihood of spending for several cycles.Those hoping to have a baby may find themselves in a desperate situation, spending tens of thousands of dollars without knowing if the treatment theyre getting is even right for them.In asurvey of 1,146 initial participants, the startupfound couples with more money had a higher rate of success. While thats not earth-shattering  money means more cycles and higher rates of success over time  the startup also found money was just one of many ways to up your chances.Women working in teaching, PR and marketing positions  fields generally filled with way more women than men  also had a higher rate of success regardless of income, education or age. Whereas women in male-dominatedfields like engineering were found to have a lower rate of success overall.One possible reason? Women in female-heavy jobs might feel safer talking about wanting to start a family.What we found were the women who were teachers were working in environments that were full of women and very supportive of people starting families, which was very different when you talk to female engineers, says co-founderDeborah Anderson-Bialis.Anderson-Bialis and her husband Jake (the other half of her co-founding team) say they reached out to about 100 of the survey respondents to get some qualitative analysis.IVF is hard enough on couples and doesnt always work for a multitude of reasons. FertilityIQ is also early days for trying to help couples figure out which doctor or treatment is best for them and the factors leading to the best chance of getting pregnant.The survey will continue to grow in respondents as FertilityIQ gets bigger and reaches more couples. The takeawayso far is women looking to undergo IVF should seek out jobs that support their choice to have a family if they want to increase their chances of success.
