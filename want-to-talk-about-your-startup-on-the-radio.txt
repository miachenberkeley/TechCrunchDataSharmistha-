When youre a startup on a budget, free publicity can be hard to come by. But TechCrunch wants to put the little guy in the lime light (at least for 60 seconds), and thats just what we do during the TC Radio Pitch-off. Each Tuesday, John Biggs and I host a radio show on Sirius XM Insight 121, and the last half of each episode is dedicated to the TC Radio Pitch-Off. Five companies get exactly one minute to pitch their startup live. We bring in a successful entrepreneur or interesting VC to be a guest judge, and after a short Q&A with the companies, we make a final decision over the winner on the air. There are a few rules and regulations when it comes to the Pitch-Off, so if you want to learn if you are eligible or find out how to apply, just keep reading:Rules:
