Elon Musk is looking for a few good engineers. The Tesla CEO took to Twitter tonight to announce Tesla is ramping up its autonomous vehicle division and needs some new talent. Oh, and he said hes going to do some of the interviews, so theres that too.Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot@teslamotors.com. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2015We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2015Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority. Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2015To apply Musk simply says to email the company and include a link to examples of your work. Its important to note that Musk stated that the company is looking for software engineers and experience with automobiles is not required. After all, vehicles are increasing becoming more software than hardware.This division of Tesla is responsible for the companys so-called Autopilot system, which is the system that turnsits Model S sedan into a quasi-autonomous vehicle. Autopilot doesnt take complete control of the car but does allow the vehicle to navigate highway traffic and road hazards unlike Googles self-driving cars that are completely autonomous.A Tesla rep told TechCrunch following the Autopilotslaunch that this may have been due to the lighting conditions at the time; if the cars AI isnt 100% confident that its safe to change lanes, it just wont. Better to have a driver take over than to autosteer into something it somehow missed, right?Elon Musk says he sees full automation coming within about 3 years; Autopilotis just a big first step.Butit might be here sooner than that. Tesla is clearly ready to ramp updevelopment.
