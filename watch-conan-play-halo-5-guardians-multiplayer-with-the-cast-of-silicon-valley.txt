Conan got to play Halo 5: Guardians multiplayer before you did, and he played it with three of his own crew including Andy Richter, against three of the stars of Silicon Valley, including Thomas Middleditch, TJ Miller and Zach Woods. Basically everyones incompetent, but it still looks like a great game.The game was on stage today at Microsofts E3 2015 event, where a huge new multiplayer mode called Warzone was unveiled with support for up to 24 players. Conan also pulls a surprise switcheroo towards the end of the tournament, and the player face cameras are unflattering to everyone, so really no one wins.
