 Google is kicking off its annual I/O developer conferencetoday. You can watch the live stream right here on this page or, if you cant watch video at work, follow along with our live blog here (or, even better, keep both open because the stream is often a minute or two behind).The keynote is scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time (but these things always tend to run a bit late).We are pretty sure that Google will tell us more about the next release of Android, maybe a bit more about the future of Android Wear and theCardboard virtual reality project, but besides that, a lot of what the company has planned for this two-and-a-half-hour event still remains a mystery.For all we know, we could see the return of Google Glass (though I wouldnt bet on it), as well as some hardware launches. Google also likes to pack a few real surprises into the keynote (remember that Google Glass skydiving demo?). This is a developer event, though, so expect to hear a lot about APIs and SDKs, too.Here is our more detailed rundown of what were expecting.
