Oculus is hosting a special, pre-E3 press event today in San Francisco, and the festivities kick off at 10 AM PT. The stream above will provide live video from the show so you can follow along with all the announcements.This is probably going to be the day Oculus takes a lot of the remaining mystery out of its much-anticipated consumer launch, which is happening early in 2016. We could get a specific release date, for instance, as well as a look at the final consumer design, and maybe a final price tag.Stay tuned, as theres probably lots more to learn at the event, including possibly the initial content lineup. Well be there live, too, bringing you the news as it happens.
