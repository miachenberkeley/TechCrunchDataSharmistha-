SpaceX is set to launch and then attempt to land a rocket at 8:29 PM Eastern Standard Time. This time around, though, SpaceX is attempting to land the rocket on solid ground rather than a robotic barge like previous attempts that resulted in fiery crashes.The Falcon 9 rocket is set to deliver 11 satellites to low-Earth orbit for ORBCOMM. Then, most of the rocket will attempt to return to terra firma and land vertically. Thats the hard part. SpaceX has been attempting this feat for several launches. This is the companys first launch in six months.And they did it! SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket. More here.
