Before each Disrupt conference, something very special happens. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of hackers come together to build a product in less than 24 hours. There is food, booze, caffeine, and usually a Nerf war of some sort. This hackathon was no different, including the fact that each hackathon is better than the last.Without any further ado, sit back and relax as we live stream you more than a hundred one-minute presentations given by hackers deprived of sleep.Enjoy!
