The girls have three months to develop an app that attempts to solve a problem in their local community. In the film, they size up their competition, interact with teachers and local mentors, learn to code, and pitch their ideas all in hopes of winning $10,000 in funding and support.Wojcicki cited optics as a reason for a lack of women who code and called out some of Googles own research:Girls dont see positive role models of other girls and women in popular culture. In a study of popular films in 11 countries, fewer than 20 percent of computer science or tech roles were held by women.YouTube seems to be a great place to launch this film, as AdAge just reported that some popular female YouTubers carry more clout than some mainstream celebs:Interesting analysis on why female YouTube stars have so much influence  https://t.co/HzzSQwRFuM Susan Wojcicki (@SusanWojcicki) October 29, 2015You can support the film by sharing it with the hashtag #Rallyforcodegirl.
