 Microsoft is holding its annual Build developer conference in San Francisco this week and after focusing on Windows, Xbox, HoloLens, and Cortana yesterday, the company will shine the spotlight on its cloud and developer tools today. You can watch the live stream right here.Thekeynote is scheduled to start at 8:30am Pacific, 11:30am Eastern, and 5:30pm Central European Time.Yesterday, Microsoft talked a lot about Cortana and bots, but today well hear more about the tools the company uses to actually build these services. Chances are we will hear a bit more about new services on Microsofts Azure cloud, but also about Xamarin, the cross-platform development service the company acquired only a few weeks ago. Indeed, we heard surprisingly little about Xamarin during the Day 1 keynote, so I wouldnt be surprised if it took center stage today.Microsoft also yesterday said that it wanted to talk more about the Office 365 ecosystem, so well probably hear more about this, too. We have a team on the ground and you can follow all of our coverage here.
