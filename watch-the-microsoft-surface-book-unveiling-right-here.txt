Microsoft just announced and unveiled a stunning convertible laptop called the Surface Book. As the video above shows, the $1,500 laptop features a detectable tablet powered by a Core i7 CPU. Its worth noting that most PC makers currently have a device very similar to the Surface Book, but none seem to be as well designed.
