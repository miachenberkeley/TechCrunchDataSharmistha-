It is very hard to convey how cool virtual reality experiences are if you havent had a chance to try it out for yourself using devices like the Oculus Rift, but this new EVE: Valkyrie trailer does a pretty good job. For added immersive effect, take your phone, put it at the bottom of a sock, and stretch the sock over your face while watching the above in full-screen mode.Or, you can take us at our word that experiencing this type of action in VR would, in fact, be mind-blowing. If this trailer had a retail box, here are the quotes that would printed on the back from the TC team.This trailer made my palms clammy. Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunchOnce this is available, Im never coming back to real life.  Darrell Etherington, TechCrunchAt the very least, dial the playback resolution all the way up to 1080p at 60fps. Even if youre not already a fan of EVE, the massively multiplayer online space trading, exploration and combat sim, this first-person cockpit dogfighter spin-off should get you excited about VR. Its a real game, in real development, targeting both Oculus Rift for the PC and Sonys Project Morpheus for the PS4, which is far more exciting than brief, static animation loops for most VR fans.
