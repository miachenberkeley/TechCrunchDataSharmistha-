As more and more civilians start flying drones, there will probably be an exponential rise in situations where authoritiesneed toquickly take down apoorly-navigated drone hoveringabove a stadium or government building.But, since drone companies have yet toprovideany sort of backdoor to manually takeover the devices controls, authorities are on their own in figuring out howto safely take downdrones mid-flight.One Dutch company, Guard From Above, has taken the innovative approach of training birds of prey to physically takedown the UAVs.The company, whichworks mainly for national and international governmental security agencies, is currently partnering with the Dutch National Police on a trial basis to determine if using birds of prey are a realistic method for taking down drones.Luckily, the Dutch National Police realize that while using an eagleis definitelythe coolest way to take down a drone, its not always going to be a realistic method. So, the force is also looking into using nets and electronic means to complement their arsenal of falcons and eagles.As youd expect, the Dutch arent the only law enforcement agency trying to figure out the best way to take down a drone. Last month, Tokyo Police released a clip of officersflying drones with large nets to catch and take down smaller drones mid-flight.And, lest we forget that these are live animals, the Dutch National Science Institute assures readersthat they arelooking into making sure that no birds are harmed in the line of duty.
