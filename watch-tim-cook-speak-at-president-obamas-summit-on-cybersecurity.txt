Today is President Barack Obamas special White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection at Stanford University, and while a number of Silicon Valley executives will be notably absent at the event, Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to speak for a 10 minute session kicking off at 10:45 AM PT (1:45 PM ET), and you can watch live above.The event runs all day, so you can watch the panels and speakers preceding and following Cook as well. The White House is using the event to talk about the intersection of private enterprise and public interest when it comes to cybersecurity, but it is perhaps significant that Cook is one of the few top-ranking executives representing private enterprise to make an appearance. His presence accordingly should provide one of the days highlights.Apple has received pushback from the FBI and other agencies regarding its decision to encrypt user smartphones in the interest of helping ensure enhanced privacy for users, which is likely in part a response to privacy fears resulting from Snowdens revolutions regarding the widespread digital communications monitoring operations put in place by the NSA.
