A project to probethe viability of using low power Bluetooth Beacon technology as an aid forindoor navigation  with a special focus on helping blind andvisually impaired people get around independently  has been awarded a $1 million grant from Google.org to broaden and accelerate its development.We last covered the ustwoRLSBjoint venture back in August 2014 when the teamdiscussedtheir concept and demoeda prototype working. Since then theyve been testing the kit in real world stations, including in London Undergrounds Pimlico station in February/March this year. And an on-going test at Londons Euston station which will wrap up bythe end of this year.The not-for-profit initiativehas now evolved theinitial ideaof building a navigator app powered byBeacon pings into a more ambitious plan to developan open standard for indoor audio navigation instructions and theoptimized arrangement of Bluetooth low energy beaconsneeded to power it.The idea being that venues wanting to embed indoor navigation hardware into their interiorsanddevelopers wanting to includeindoor navigationfunctionality within their appswill be able to tap into the standard,helping  hopefully  toacceleratethe development ofmore accessible indoor navigation infrastructure. And resulting ina more consistent experience for people trying to navigate different venues, usingmultipleapps.What weve got the grant for and what were doing is were creating an open standard that can give the likes of built environment owners such as retailers or transport networks we give them advice through the standard on how they might install and maintain and decide on which technology they should be using inside their built environment, saysustwosUmesh Pandya.Also part of that standard we have guidelines for what we call digital navigation services  so thats people like Google Maps, Citymapper The instructions and how to structure an audio instruction, what should be contained in it, whats the syntax when communicating with a visually impaired people whos using audio-based navigation.Pandya also reckons the technology itselfcould have wider applications for other groups who may not be visually impaired but who may still want help navigating a new indoor venue, such astourists, for example.The team is hoping to publish v1of the standards towards the end of Q1 next year.From there onwards well be looking for more trials. We really want to attack and unpack the retail environment because we believe thats quite important. We believe there will be some simple things that retailers are able to do to make their existing Beacon fleet accessible to the visually impaired  which in turn brings them more customers when people are able to navigate their stores, he adds.In terms of a likely timeframe for the first real-world deployments that might be followingits Beacon tech installation guidelinesPandya says the team is hoping to seea commitment, or the start of a rollout, across one complete network by the end of 2017. By which hemeans either a whole retail store or an entire transport network.I dont think its too far in the future, he adds. Beacons you can buy now. Handsets with Bluetooth you can buy now. I dont think its a technology restrain  its just now an organizational challenge.What were saying  Ive worked in accessibility, Ive done many accessible apps and products and services  and what I have learnt over the years is that when we you bake it in from the beginning, as an inclusive design approach, it doesnt really cost you. Its minor compared to bolting it on later when you then go now we need to make our product accessible You can build that in from the beginning at minor cost. The Google.org grant awarded to the project is part of theGoogle Impact Challenge: Disabilitiesprogram.As well as ustwo and the RLSB, an alliance of organizations is backing the Wayfindrinitiative, including app developers, locations, researchers, hardware manufacturers and vision impairment specialists.
