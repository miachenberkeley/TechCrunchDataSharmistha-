WeChat, the Uber popular Chinese message app with more than 500 million active users, is taking a leaf out of the Skype playbook after it launched an international telephone calling service.The service is initiallyavailable for users based in the U.S., Hong Kong and India, but it will roll out to others over time. WeChat Out is different fromthe existing calling options inside WeChat (voice and video) because it allows for calls to actual phone numbers (mobile and landline) rather than just to fellow WeChat users.WeChat, which is owned by Chinese Internet giant Tencent, is gifting its users an initial $0.99 in credit (which it says will allow up to 100 minutes in calls) to get things started, although ithasnt revealed the cost of calls once that freebie has been eaten up. (Those with the calling feature enabled can look prices up inside the app as explained here.)The service is known for being hugely innovative in China, but itis relatively late to the international callingarea. Skype, of course, pioneered the concept while Line  another popular messaging app in Asia  added its own version nearly two years ago. WeChat did launch an standalone international free calls appback in 2014, but that servicehasnt set the world alight.Tencent doesnt break out its user numbers for WeChat based on location, but we can assume that the majority of its active users are based in China, where WeChat is the default mobile messaging app used by people of all ages. For a while it seemed like the company had stopped pushing theapp overseasbut it has increased its internationalization of late. Aside from this international calling feature, WeChat launched its mobile wallet  which has 200 million users in China  in South Africa, the same country where it just unveiled a $3.4 million fund for investing in local startups.
