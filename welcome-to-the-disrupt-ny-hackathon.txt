Let the coding begin! Over 1,000 hackers have filed into the Manhattan Center and arediligently banging out code and tearing apart APIs. Over the next 24 hours these teams will work furiously, powered by Red Bull and Nerf Gun tomfoolery, to create a stunning application or hardware project.Starting tomorrow at 11:30, these teams will present on the massive Disrupt stage. The presentations are open to the public and live-streamed on TechCrunch.All the hacks will be judged by a panel of local experts and graded on a scale of 1-5. Those teams whose hacks received a 3 or higher rating will receive two tickets to Disrupt. Please note these tickets are not transferable once the conference starts Monday morning.General notes
