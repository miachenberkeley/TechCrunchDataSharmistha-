Theres a lot to like about Googles own self-driving cars, but if youve got kids, youd need a fleet just to get them to the soccer game and back. That, presumably, is why the Google initiatives first direct collaboration with an automaker will automate a nice, roomy new Pacifica minivan.Not only is the mileage great (its a hybrid) but theres space for the whole family! But more importantly for Google, its a very different type of vehicle from what the project has tested thus far, although the Lexus SUVs used early on were fairly traditional.So while point-to-point travel for individuals is certainly on the table for future Google autonomous vehicles, the company is clearly looking into broader applications that require a different approach.Self-driving cars could be incredibly useful for disabled or aged people, for instance, but the question of accessibility  wheelchair accommodation, an interface for the seeing-impaired, etc.  immediately appears. A big platform like the Pacifica is a more realistic test bed for exploring such considerations.Around 100 vehicles will be specially prepared by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to work with Googles sensor suite. For the present, theyll be limited to testing on the companys California test track.
