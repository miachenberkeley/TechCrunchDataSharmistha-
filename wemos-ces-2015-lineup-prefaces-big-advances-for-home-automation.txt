Belkins WeMo home automation gadgets started off pretty modest in scope, but over the past few years theyve launched more and more WeMo devices, first on their own and later with partners who have far more experience in specific verticals. This year at CES, WeMo expanded its LED smart lighting lineup with bulbs from OSRAM Sylvania and TCP. It also debuted new home sensors, which can help homeowners setup their system to better automate their smart connected appliances and accessories.The WeMo lineup includes a keychain sensor, window and door open/shut sensors, alarm, motion and water flow sensors. Altogether they can help do anything from triggering different activities when specific individuals arrive or leave the home, enhance home security, or even monitor your entire homes water usage with an easy-to-install flow sensor that can detect usage by different faucets, toilets and taps throughout your house.WeMos model is smart: partner with the experts, and focus on the connected elements that make everything smart. Compared to others who work on the device with a more holistic approach in-house, however, the connected features of some of these partner appliances, like the Belkin WeMo-enabled Crockpot, can feel somewhat limited. But the new sensor suite should help coordinate things and build in a whole lot more genuine automation.The lighting options are launching throughout 2015, starting now with pre-orders of select models, and theyre available at prices ranging from $20 to $80. The sensors wont be launching until the second half of 2015, with pricing yet to be determined.
