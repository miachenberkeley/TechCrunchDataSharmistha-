WeWork, the co-working real estate startup valued north of $5 billion, is launching WeLive, a residential rental building that offers flexible renting and a nicely packaged set of amenities.The new program launches for New York (at 110 Wall Street), the same building where WeWork has its main space in the Financial District, as well as DC, a 2221 S. Clark Street in Arlington.The spaces have studios, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR, and 4BR spaces, serving up to eight people, and the studios can come in single bed apartments or two beds to split up the space between roommates.But whats more interesting is that folks can rent however they want, with the freedom of a month-to-month agreement.The least expensive deal is a shared Studio Plus apartment, that comes with two beds, and starts at $1375/month. Keep in mind that includes furniture, bedding, and kitchenware. There are currently over 200 units, available to anyone.For an extra $150, users will have access to a full set of amenities, including monthly cleaning, high-speed internet and Verizon cable.WeWork is positioning this as an easy way to move to New York (like as a startup) and get going without all the extra costs of moving, buying furniture and kitchenware, and getting utility bills set up.Plus, the WeLive space will also have community events like a Happy Hour, Karaoke sessions, etc., all of which can be investigated on the WeLive app.Given that, at least the NYC location, the WeLive space is in the same building as WeWork, its easy to see how this could be a convenient living option for a NY startup.However, the WeLive space could also be attractive to people just graduating from NYC universities and looking for a job, or people who are losing their lease but havent chosen a more permanent settlement yet. And with the long list of amenities included in the deal, it would be easy to see people staying far longer than they expected.You can learn more about WeLive right here.
