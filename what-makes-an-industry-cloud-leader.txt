Gordon Ritter is the co-founder and general partner of Emergence Capital.Over the last several years atEmergence Capitalwe have seen an exciting new set of companies emerge that offer cloud solutions within a specific industry vertical  collectively known as industry cloud companies. The opportunity is enormous.In fact, many people dont realize that vertical-specific software represented the largest segment of the worldwide software market in 2014 with $114 billion in revenues (Gartner, March 2015).These companies might not be well-known outside specific industries, but ask anyone within an industry vertical and they can tell you the cloud companies that are transforming how they do their jobs. For example, in the global life sciences industry, you would hear aboutVeeva Systems(an Emergence portfolio company), and in insurance, you would hear aboutGuidewire.What distinguishes the leaders of this new class of industry-specific cloud companies? We set out to understand this question and distilled our learning into a set of 10 questions that industry cloud companies can ask themselves to see if they are on the right track. We call this the Industry Cloud Leadership Audit.Are your customers (the industry buyers)A yes answer to these questions would suggest that you are an important business partner to your customer, and that you are helping them connect to their end users.For example, by offering products that touch many points of a customer life cycle, Veeva Systems has become an integral solution to life sciences companies. At Veeva, we started with a CRM product, but have now expanded into master data management, enterprise content management, Key Opinion Leader profiling and reference data. We span an entire life sciences company from R&D to Manufacturing to Medical to Sales and Marketing, said Matt Wallach, president and co-founder of Veeva Systems.Similarly, Guidewire has become a key voice in the global insurance industry. Were frequently invited to speak to our customers boards, steering committees, internal all-hands meetings, and the like  in part to talk about our products, but more importantly to share our perspective on industry developments. While every insurer knows more about their business than we ever will, Guidewire has a global perspective on how the entire industry is approaching fundamental technology questions, explained Marcus Ryu, Guidewire Software CEO.Therealso are a number of early stage industry cloud companies that are building solutions that address the questions above:Blend Labs. Enabling mortgage lenders by replacing the green screen technology, while also reinventing the customer experience of applying for a mortgage by integrating external data sources and abstracting away complexity.ALICE App. Enabling hotels by providing a single platform to connect concierge, front desk and housekeeping, while also giving the end consumer an entirely new way to engage with their hotel through a mobile application.Tulip Retail.Enabling retailers by integrating their legacy back-end systems with their e-commerce inventory, while also building an iPad application to help their retail associates interact with their customers.Viewics. Helping hospitals and labs understand their patients through analytics, while also providing solutions that help Viewics customers share data withtheirkey constituents: patients, payors and providers.OpenGov.Enabling local governments by providing better budgeting software, while also providing constituent citizens with the ability to track and monitor government spending in real time.When companies build solutions with these goals in mind, we believe that industry-focused solutions will not only outperform all-purpose horizontal solutions in the market, but they also can protect against disruptors who often start with an end-consumer-oriented solution.Even though vertical software is already the biggest segment of the worldwide software market, we believe that the market will continue to expand as industry cloud companies become an increasingly important partner in their respective industries.
