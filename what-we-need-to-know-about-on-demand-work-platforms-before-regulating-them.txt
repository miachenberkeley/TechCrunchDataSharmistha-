Devin Fidler heads the Workable Futures Initiative at the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley-based nonprofit research and consulting organization.Aswefast approach the 2016 election cycle, the future ofon-demandworkplatformsis at a crossroads, with Uber, TaskRabbit and other market leaders facing increasedscrutiny and skepticismfrom regulators and political leaders.At the same time, these platformsinadvertently contribute to a growing anxiety among the public, who are concerned that theon-demandeconomy may change the future ofworkfor the worse  if their jobs are not entirely automated out of existence.Along with several colleagues from the Institute for the Future, Ihad the opportunity to address some of these very concerns at the Department of Labor,presenting an alternative viewpointto Secretary Perez and his colleagues.With a number of technologies emerging together to enable the unprecedented ability to coordinate and allocate resources in real time, a corresponding rise of newworkand organizational structures may be an inevitability.Despite this, a number of policy leaders and many in the media are still having the wrong conversation about theseplatforms, not asking the right questions about the underlying technology shifts taking place.Instead, they are attempting to categorize the entire industry as either good or bad. In our view, this is almost like 19th century politicians trying to hold a Yes/No voteon industrialization.Our perspective is basedondirect research into these work platforms over the last two years, which suggest a far more complex ecosystem. Here I share just a few of our recent findings:These anecdotal examples are not intended to refute the sharpest critics ofworkplatforms, forweve also found considerable evidence to validate many of their chief concerns. For instance, deep pay disparities between contractorsonsomeworkplatformsand average compensation rates which can fall below the minimum wageonothers.Wecannot be passive bystanders to the future ofwork, hoping that currentworkplatforms, as admirable as many ofthemare, can evolve into whatweneedas a country: positiveplatforms, whichwedefine ason-demandworksystems that are intentionally designed to maximize the benefits for everyone connected tothem including, and especially, their workers.Our simple rule of thumb is that the positive externalities of theseplatformscan be designed to outweigh their negative externalities.Collaborating with industry and policy leaders,weare now striving to ask the right questions about this technology  and develop the answers most likely to promote positiveplatforms.Wesee great promise in pricing models that dont commoditize individual tasks, but instead align the interests of the platform with its workers. For instance, a commissions-based model similar to how entertainment agencies operate, where an agencys revenue is a flat percentage of their clients earnings. Operating in this way, platform owners would be directly incentivized to maximizetheir platform workers revenue.Weare already seeingplatformsthat strongly suggest the answer to this is Yes. For instance, as much of the U.S. education system remains in financial distress (both for students and colleges), the crowdsourced platform Duolingo applies a Mechanical Turk-type translationworkmodel that enables teaching languages to its users for free, with incredibly impressive results. (According to the company, there are more people learning languageonDuolingos platformthan in the entire U.S. public school system.)Similarly, it is not difficult to imagine the immense matchmaking power ofon-demandplatformsbeing used to address issues like underemployment and even overall GDP growth, by more dynamically matching people toworkand training opportunities.These are very tentative answers, and much more research is needed. Its our hope that industry and policy captains continue coming forward toworkwith us, sharing their data, wisdom and statecraft, sowecan better cultivate this technology in a directionweall support.Ultimately, our traditional corporate/organizational structures are themselves a technology  one that was mostly designed to coordinate mass industrial production. As digitalplatformsprovide new ways of coordinating economic activity, they will upset many of our assumptions about howworkand organizations should behave.Our task over the coming decades is to amplify their opportunities while mitigating their challenges. Only together canwedesign new structures all of us can live with  and workin.
