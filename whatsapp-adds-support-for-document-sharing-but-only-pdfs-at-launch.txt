WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned mobile messaging service that recently hit 1 billion users worldwide, is today rolling out a much-anticipated feature to its apps on iOS and Android devices: documentsharing. Though the company hasnt yetmade an official announcement, a number of WhatsApp users have seen the feature pop upalongside other sharing options, like photo or video sharing, contact sharing, or location sharing, for example.The feature works similarly on both iOS and Android devices. In a chat on Android, you tap the attachment icon then pressthe new Document icon that appears. (To make room for the option on the pop-up window, WhatsApp compressed Photo and Video sharing options into one Camera option instead.)On iOS, you tap the arrow icon in the chat then pick Share Document from the menu that appears.At launch, users are able to select documents from cloud storage servicesincluding Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, and others, but the feature is unfortunately limited to only PDF files at this time.In some cases, WhatsApp wont even display the other file types that are present on the cloud storage service you pick, so as to limit user confusion. However, the app did let me pick an Office document saved onGoogle Drive, but then failed to share it, insteadoffering an error message about the unsupported file type.If the recipient hasnt upgraded to the latest version of WhatsApp, documentsharing wont work either, we found in tests. (The app will tell you that the contact has to update WhatsApp to receive documents.)When shared, WhatsApp displays a file preview of the PDF, notating also the number of pages, file size and type.The fact that it has dedicated a field in the message window to displayfile type is a good hint that other file formats will be supported in the future.Even with the limited functionality available at present, document sharing could help to boost business use of WhatsApps messenger app, given how prevalent PDFs are in the professional world.That fits in with WhatsApps larger agenda, revealed earlier this year, which sees the company increasing its focus on its business customers.CEO Jan Koum said in January that WhatsApp would begin testing more commercial services, including those that would allow consumers to communicate with businesses.Document sharing makes sense in this larger context of business-friendly features.Of course, the feature will have direct consumer benefits as well for things like sharing flyers, e-tickets, scans, and other PDFs of a more personal nature.And because WhatsApp has been invested in end-to-end encryption on its network, the documents shared on its service will be protected.The feature is arriving now on both iOS and Android, though not yet Windows Phone.
