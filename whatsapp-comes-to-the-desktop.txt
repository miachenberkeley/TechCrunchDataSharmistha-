Are you one of the 600 million people on WhatsApp? Do you grow tired of having to type all of your messages through your phone? Good news!Theres now a desktop version.Its a web app rather than a native client  and for now, at least, it seems to only play friendly with Google Chrome.But if youre ready to dive in, you can find the new web-ready version of WhatsApp right over hereOne weird catch: to log in on the desktop, you have to take a picture of a QR code through WhatsApp on your phone. This is necessary, presumably, because WhatsApp uses your phone number and SMS verifications rather than usernames/passwords. This currently works on Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry but due to Apple platform limitations (WhatsApps words, there  were not sure what limitations they mean), iOS users are left out in the cold.On the platforms where it works, however, its very slick.Curiously, it seems as if its using your phone for more than just the initial login; note the orange warning in the screenshot below. If your phone dies, so does your WhatsApp web connection.
