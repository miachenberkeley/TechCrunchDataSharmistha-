Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsAppappears to have starteddeliberatelyblocking links to rival messaging app Telegram so users cant share clickable Telegram-associated URLs in their chats. The URLs just appear as unlinked text.Mobile messaging customer service startup orat.io noticedthe issue earlier today, and has bloggedabout ithere.Currently links only appear to beblockedwithin the Android app, with no unlinking going onin the iOS app. Even in the latest version of the iOS app, which was updated as of November 30  we checked.So its possible this is abug rather than a deliberate attempt by WhatsApp to discourage its users from easilytapping intoa rival service.That said,Android developerJernej Viragclaims to have found evidence in WhatsApps code that suggests itis indeedspecifically targeting Telegram#WhatsApp code decompilation actually shows that they target all domains with "telegram" in it specifically. pic.twitter.com/cW6vQU4j2f Jernej Virag (@jernejv) December 1, 2015Weve reached out to WhatsApp to ask bug or feature and will update this post with any response.In a note onits websiteTelegram also claimsitsFacebook page hasvanished  for no apparent reason.In an email exchange with TechCrunch, Telegram founder Pavel Durov describedWhatsApp blocking links to its service as short-sighted.Of the Facebook page deletion Durovwas less concerned, adding: We didnt use it, so we didnt even notice it.The messaging app, which launched in mid 2013,has seen someimpressive engagementgrowth this year  with the volume of messages sent daily via Telegramrising from around 1 billion this February to 12 billion by September.Although its monthly active users remained at around the 60 million mark between May and September.Telegramis still very much dwarfed byWhatsApps massive user-base, of course. The Facebook-owned giantclaimed to have passed the 900 million monthly user markas of this September, so it cant be far off hittingthe magic 1BN MAUs mark.Perhaps that milestoneprospect is encouraging WhatsApp to throw its weight around against upstart messaging rivals.Whatever the truth,its a not-so-gentle reminder that when it comes to dominant commercial platforms the content we the usersare allowed to see andaccessis perenniallyat the whim ofthe platform owner and their commercial interests. And no, thats not cool.
