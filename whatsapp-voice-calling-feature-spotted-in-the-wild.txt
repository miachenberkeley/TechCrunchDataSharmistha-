SelectAndroid users are reporting theyve happenedupon a new voice-calling feature in their WhatsApp mobile applications, indicating that the company is testing the addition ahead of its expansion into territory currently dominated by apps like Skype and Viber. One user has now shared screenshots and video of the voice-calling feature in action, which he said was activated when someone who already had the feature called him.The user who first reported this did so by posting his screenshots and video to Reddit. Hes alsobased in India, which points to the possibilitythat users in that region may be the early testers for the new feature. After his post, others then joined him in sharingscreenshots of their WhatsApp applications, which showed a new tab for Calls next to the tabs for Chats and Contacts.We should note that many of these posts have now been pulled down from Reddit as they contained personal information. However, the video of the feature is still live on YouTube. (See below). Its unclear at this time how widespread the rollout is, because many news reports are stemming from this original Reddit post. Weve reached out to WhatsApp for clarification and will update with their response if we receive one.Based on the shared video, WhatsApp voice calling offers several standard call-handling options, including a speakerphone setting, mute button andthe ability to continue to send messages while taking a call.The update is available in the newest build of the WhatsApp client, its said  version 2.11.508. However, this is not yet available on the Google Play Store for a public download.Its possible that WhatsApp didnt intend for the feature to go live at all, as, based on the early reports via Reddit, voice calling is still buggy and not fully functional. For instance, the original poster says that others can receive a call from him, but they then cant call him back.This is also not the first time users have reported seeing a voice-call option pop up in their WhatsApp clients, we should point out. In December, a Dutch blog leaked screenshots showing much of the same thing. Whats new today, then, is how the feature can be passed along to other users  something that wasnt reported at the time of the first leak.Voice calling is something WhatsApp has had on its roadmap for some time. A year ago, WhatsApp CEOJan Koum announced at Mobile World Congress that the company would expand into voice calling, which would see his app then going up against not just Skype and Viber, but other competitors, including KakaoTalk, LINE, BBM, Hike and more.We use the least amount of bandwidth and we use the hell out of it. We will focus on simplicity, Koum said at the time. He also stated that voice calling wouldcome to Android and iOS first and then roll outto select Nokia and BlackBerry phones.The move to launch voice calling comes shortly after WhatsApps expansion to the web last month, which enableddesktop users to access the service through a web browser. To log in on the desktop, users have to take a picture of a QR code through WhatsApp on their phone because of the services reliance on phone number and SMS verifications instead of usernames and passwords. The log-in option is available to users on Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry, but not yet on iOS.WhatsApp, a company that was acquired by Facebook for $22 billion, also recently announced it has grown to 700 million users, up from 600 million in August. In the announcement, posted by Koum to his Facebook profile, he also promised that the company was excited to keep building a great product in 2015.Weve reached out to WhatsApp for an official comment on the latest leak, and will update if they respond. Update: The company says itschecking to see if it can provide an official comment. Stay tuned.Update 2: 4 PM ET, Whatsapp has yet to provide comment.
