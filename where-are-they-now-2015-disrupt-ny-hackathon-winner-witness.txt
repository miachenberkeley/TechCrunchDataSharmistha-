The Hackathon at Disrupt NYis almost upon us, so we thought itd be fun to look back at last years Hackathon to see what the winners of the Disrupt NY 2015 Hackathon have been up to in the year that has passed since the show.The year has been a good one for Witness, the simple virtual panic button that aims to keep users safe during an emergency.When users press the big red on-screen button, Witness calls and texts your emergency contacts and records your camera, location and microphone activity, streaming that info over cellular or Wi-Fi to your emergency contacts in real time.And it does so all while leaving your phones screen black so would-be attackers are unaware that youre recording them.A few months after winning the Hackathon, Witness officially launched as amobile app on the Apple App Store in July 2015, though founder Marinos Bernitsas had to remove the black screen setting to get App Store approval. A version of the Witness app for Googles Android operating system is currently in early access beta, according to the companys website.Witness got its 15 minutes of fame in December 2015 when it was featured in a brief conversation on the cybercrime television show CSI: Cyber. You can watch the clip here.Were excited to see what comes next from Witness andabsolutely thrilled to see what this years Hackathon participants are going to come up with.We alsocant wait to see all you wonderful hackers and builders at the Hackathon, which takes place May 7-8 at the lovely Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in New York City, followed by the main Disrupt conference May 9-11 at the same venue.Our sponsors help make Disrupt happen.
