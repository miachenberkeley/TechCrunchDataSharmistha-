We got our first look at FOVE, the virtual reality headset thats controlled by eye movement, at Disrupt SF 2014. FOVE was one of the entrants in the Startup Battlefield, and while the company didnt win the competition, there were definitely some good times ahead for the company that started in the academic collaboration facility at the University of Tokyo.FOVE launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the headset back in May, with the goal of raising $250,000 to help bring itsproduct to market. That campaign closed earlier this month and raised over $480,000 from nearly 1,500 backers.Just before the campaign closed, FOVE introduced a new and vastly improved headset design that is lighter, smaller and more comfortable. The updated design looks pretty slick. According to the company, the form factor has been refined and enhanced to make the product more comfortable to wear, and updated clasps on the headset let the unit better adapt to different-shaped heads.A few weeks ago, FOVE posted an update to itsKickstarter that theyve secured additional funding (an undisclosed amount) from Samsung Ventures, which allowed the company to more aggressively pursue integration with the Valve Lighthouse personal tracking solution and OpenVR.With a successful crowdfunding campaign under itsbelt, FOVE can now focus on getting itsproduct in the hands of eager backers, as well as work to bring added functionality to itseye-tracking VR headset. The funding itreceived from Kickstarter backers and from Samsung Ventures is a good start, and time will tell where FOVE will be headed next.Applications for this years Battlefield have formally closed, but theres still hope.
