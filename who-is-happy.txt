Truly the bountyof technologys cup overfloweth. Cannabissmokersof the world wishing they could share their buzz with others can do so viaan anonymous geolocation app called Who Is Happy, on iOSand Android.Colloquially dubbing itself a Foursquare for Stoners, the just-got-high checkinapp is the work ofPaulo Costa  an epilepsy sufferer whois hoping the resulting publicityhelps to decriminalize cannabis in his native Brazil, given its medical potential as a treatment forreducing seizures.Who Is Happywas launched in Brazil in January, where itpushed into the top 30 most downloaded apps.This week its opened for downloads in the U.S., and Costa is currently in Silicon Valley taking meetingsto try to drum up investor interest, before heading to Denver for more meetings (and, well, the Cannabis Cup). Hes bootstrapped development up to this point.As we noted last December, VCs are sparking up more weed-tech investments.In the 12 months up to that point, CrunchBase recorded 29 venture investments in cannabis startups for a total of nearly $90 million in capital committed. As pot gets decriminalized the entrepreneurs are primed to move in and make a (legal) killing.The Who Is Happy app lets users tap a button to tag their buzz on a map suitably hazily, with checkins indicated on the map by a puff of green smoke with a radius of 1km for four hours after the checkin button is pushed, making it tricky to pinpoint the exact location and moment a spliff/blunt/joint/doobie/Camberwell Carrot/ptard was sparked. Individual users are never tagged.As well as checking out where fellow smokers have been getting high, users cansee a global leaderboardof happiness by country, and collect their own stats to quantify their spliff smoking.The app isfree to download but Costa seesfuture business potential by building it out intoa global social network for cannabis smokers  monetizing via ads.We are working in some new features to provide to users useful geolocated information about dispensaries and doctors, whom will be able to advertise on our platform, he tells TechCrunch.Presumably on-demand snack delivery startups might also locatesynergies with such a happy and hungry community.
