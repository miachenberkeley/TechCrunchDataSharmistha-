Welp, it happened.T-Mobile CEO John Legere decided to field questions about the Binge On program the company launched. Is it great? Is it throttling? The EFF has its thoughts. The organization also decided to participate in Legeres Twitter Q&A which led to this gem:.@EFF pic.twitter.com/pv6V4oOJwS John Legere (@JohnLegere) January 7, 2016Who the fuck are you anyway, EFF? Why are you stirring up so much trouble? And who pays you? Legere says in response. I mean, theres this official description: The Electronic Frontier Foundation is an international non-profit digital rights group based in the United States.But just in case that wasnt enough, the EFF has responded and needs your help:T-Mobile's CEO is dying to know who EFF is. Friends, please tweet at @JohnLegere with the hashtag #WeAreEFF to enlighten him. EFF (@EFF) January 7, 2016This should be interesting. Stay tuned.
