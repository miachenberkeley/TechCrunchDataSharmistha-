LinkedIn, the social network for the working world,has been on a mission to adddifferent services to its platform to expand the ways that people use it beyond looking for jobs and basicnetworking. One of these, a publishing platform for peopleto write and share blog posts about work life and other professional subjects, is today getting a boost: anew analytics toolso thatauthors canbetter track traffic that theirposts receive.If you use LinkedIn, you will be all too familiar with its Whos viewed your profile? emails and other alerts: you can think of this new analytics service as Whos viewed your posts?The news comes on the heels of decent growth for LinkedIns original content efforts: the self-publishing tool, whichearlier this year was opened up to all230 million users who live in English-speaking countries, is currently seeing100,000 published posts per week, according to a LinkedIn spokesperson, with more than 1.5 million posts on the platform overall.While LinkedIn is formally announcing the new analytics tools today, they were actually rolled out quietly to some users at the end of April  with LinkedIns blessing it seems (the company even links to a post about the analytics, written on April 29, in its own blog today about the service).For those who publish on LinkedIn, the new tool will let you look at posts going back six months  a period that may well get extended, potentially as a premium product, considering that LinkedIn does keep the data for older posts, too.Once in the post stats, you can see how many people viewed, liked and shared the post, as well aswhich LinkedIn users took any of those actions (Im asking if there is a way to browse incognito as there is on LinkedIn itself, will update when I know).There are also furtherdemographic break-downs based on those who are reading as logged-in users covering areas like industry, location and even job title. The emphasis here is on logged-in users becauseviewers can theoretically come to pages from anywhere onthe wider web by way of a URL link.But, just as you see with advertising analytics tools, I suspect that over time LinkedIn will be able to incorporate tracking analytics, however, to give you demographicinformation about even those users.There is also an option to view traffic and other stats by days of the week.The other area where this is interesting is that it leverages a lot of what LinkedIn has already created with its analytics behind the scenes, specifically around profile views, an area that has also been updated in the past year with more functionality.The bigger picture, of course, for LinkedIn is that the company has been looking for ways to get people to stay on its site for longer periods of time, and to increase traffic to the site overall. Both of these metrics are even more urgent at the moment, considering the companys last quarterly earningsincludeda downward revision for future revenue estimates that sent shares on a nosedive.Analytics may get more power users interested in publishing on the site, but perhaps just as importantly, by arming them with stats that can help them grow traffic to their blog posts, LinkedIn is enlisting them in its own bigger traffic growth campaign.Image: David Petherick
