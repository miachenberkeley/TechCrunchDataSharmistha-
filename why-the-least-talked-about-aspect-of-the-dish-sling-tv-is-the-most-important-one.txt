As multiple outlets have reported, this $20 per month subscription service gives subscribers access to TNT, TBS, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, the Disney Channel, ESPN and ESPN2  without the need for a separate cable subscription.While the decoupling of these channels from cable is definitely noteworthy, to me themostinterestingaspectof this new offering isonethat few people seem to be talkingaboutat all: the inclusion of the new Maker Studios channel.Inmy last TechCrunch article, I discussed why Disney and other major media companies have been buying YouTube Multichannel Networks (MCNs) like Maker Studios. I predicted that they would leverage their vast distribution networks, production expertise, and relationships with advertisers to grow the value of MCNs and to create a whole new class of YouTube celebrity.For content produced by these YouTube superstars, advertisers will finally begin to value their content  regularly viewed by millions of loyal and passionate fans  at the same prices that they would for similarly sized audiences on television. I alsotalkedabouthow, as this shift happens, it will continue to blur the lines between YouTube and television in a much broader sense: Larger ad budgets from Madison Avenue will attract higher quality production and storytelling talent from Hollywood, and the two will increasingly transition their mutual courtship from the world of television to that of YouTube.It is in the context of this transition that the Maker Channel onSlingTVis such a big deal. This is the first time that content from homegrown YouTube talent has been bundled alongside content from traditional media icons, as well as the first time that content from so many cable channels has been made available on the same screens that YouTube has thus far dominated.Before delving into the implications of this trend, a little background.Over the past five years,TVadvertising has seen a5 percentcompound annual growth rate, with blue-chip brand spending hitting$108.6 billionin 2013.Despite this growth, consumption of traditionalTVhas fallen 10 percent. Many brands are starting to realize theyre paying more and more to get less and less. Meanwhile, 2013 was the first yeardigital ad spend surpassedTVadvertising, and online video advertising is predicted to continue growing21 percentper year, with YouTube octupling itsrevenue over the next 10 years.With several big brands like McDonalds and Priceline.com planning to shift up to25 percentof theirTVadvertising budgets online, it makes predictions of a$72 billion(thats billion with a B) drop inTVadvertising more believable.Television networks and other major media companies see the writing on the wall, and theyre protecting their interests by buying multi-channel networks  aggregators ofYouTube producers and talentthat can bring in major advertising dollars.For the advertisers, these acquisitions give them peace of mind: they can work with the same people at the media companies theyve always worked with, transitioning ad dollars fromTVto digital smoothly, while maintaining the ability to shift those dollars back if it doesnt go as planned.For the networks, it gives them the chance to maintain control over those ad dollars as brands accelerate their transitions fromTVto digital. The addition of of Maker toSlingTV, then, serves as a bridge  attracting young teens and twenty-somethings to the service and introducing them to cable channels that they had long ago stopped watching (if they ever watched them at all), while introducing television advertisers to the content that has so successfully held this valuable young demographic captive for the past several years.Now that you understand what has led to the integration of Maker intoSlingTV, here are a few of the implications:As networks pour money into MCNs, we can expect to see more large brands spending big budgets on content from YouTube stars. Many of these brands will take thingsonestep further, realizing that, now that the media companies dont control the distribution channels the way they used to, they can eschew networks altogether and become media companies themselves (see AT&Tsrecent acquisition of Fullscreenand Verizonsrecent bid to acquire Aol).This is all exciting stuff, especially if you are a big advertiser, a big network or a big YouTube star. But whataboutthe rest of us?If you dont have enough money to advertise on ESPN or the Maker channel, or enough YouTube subscribers to create shows alongside Disneys premium channels, then this is still great news for you. In the YouTube landscape, there are millions of original content creators with the same talent that made YouTube valuable in the first place.Likewise, there are millions of small- to medium-sized businesses to work with (e.g. Facebook hasmore than 1 million advertisers; Google AdWords has more than 2 million, and by definition, these are businesses spending money online). And there are increasingly more options to connect these parties.The worlds of YouTube, publishing and advertising are large enough, diverse enough, and growing quickly enough to enable all parties to implement their own version of the strategies that Disney, Maker and AT&T are pursuing. This is not a trend for a few brands with deep pockets. Any brand can get a direct path to its audience and replicate big-budget initiatives at a cost that makes sense. The key for brands of any size will be to move on their digital content strategies quickly.
