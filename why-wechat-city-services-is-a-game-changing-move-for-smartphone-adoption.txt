Editors note:Tudor Stanciu is an associate atBiris Goranlaw firm in Bucharest specializing in intellectual property and competition issues. You can find more of his opinions, along with startup reviews onWhats With?!.Last month,WeChatlaunched City Servicesin select towns across China. If youre already a user ofWeChat, simply change your location to one of the three pilot cities and the language to Chinese and youll be presented with a wide array of additionalservicesthat may be accessed from right within the app.As the name says, it basically is trying to solve all problems any person (which is somewhat equal to what the customer persona is in the case of messaging apps) would need to get solved without actually exitingWeChat. Booking doctor appointments, reporting incidents to the police, booking flights, hailing a taxi  you name it.But behind an obvious approach to becoming a leader in as many verticals as possible, the true force of whatWeChatis doing lies within the app itself  and messaging apps in general  by becoming an aggregator of the most frequently used and popularservicesavailable on mobile devices.This will not only make customer retention less of a hassle, but it might also growWeChats user-base, both among Generation Z, which will take on this as they become accustomed to portable technology during their upbringing, but also among the large numbers not interested in scores of new apps who just want the comfort brought by technology. This is what would harness the true force ofall-in-one apps, and this is where were heading.WeChatCityServicesmay very well also mean a great deal for the further growth ofsmartphoneand portable deviceadoption worldwide. It is estimated that almost 7 out of 10 people in the world will own a portable device until 2017.Sure, storage in phones is not the expensive part of a phone, but while looking at my own Android device, I cant help but feel a little bit frustrated when the occasional not sufficient storage space to install pop-up appears. And I definitely wouldnt buy another phone just for the sake of more memory space.This is an area thatmay be tackled in the next decade of mobile devices development: how to get access to more information and moreservicesfrom your handheld device without the need for strong hardware. Think of mobile computing-as-a-serivce, Project Ara,push notificationsreplacing apps in their entirety and contextual search engines giving you access to app informationWeChatCityServices opens a gateway to minimizemultiple-app dependency and may be the stepping stone tominimizedevice dependency.IfWeChatcapitalizes on this properly, then it could turn into an app with other satellite apps acting as small, resource-low plug-ins to it.Werestill far from that, but bet on messaging apps becoming what app stores are now  a gateway to finding the best additional plugins to add to your interface with a single tap of a button. The question will then be: Would you be willing to pay in order to have an all-in-one facilitator on your phone, andhow much?
