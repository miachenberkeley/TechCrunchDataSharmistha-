Geographic density is the new network effect. pic.twitter.com/NpmUnZgVfH David Sacks (@DavidSacks) June 7, 2014If Sacks is right, that the ridesharing provider with the most geographic saturation ends up with the lowest costs and best rider experience, then the strategy is clear: Raise as much money as possible to subsidize both supply and demand in what, to some observers, appears to be awinner-take-all market.But doUbers network effects really scale infinitely, orwillthey reach a point of decreasing marginal returns? Could Lyft achieve parity in pickup wait times and driver downtime with only a fraction ofUbers scale?Lets imagine thatUberachieves a geographic saturation advantage of 10 or even 100 times more drivers in a given area than Lyft (realistically this is unlikely, given the ease with which drivers can work for both services simultaneously). But even if Lyft did concede such an enormous advantage, one could envision the ridesharing market expanding to the point where they get a driver to pick you up within three minutes every time.Whats the difference between getting picked up in one minute and three minutes? Not much.If Lyft can hit that target, theywillhave negatedUbers route-density advantage, and with it, a major premise of the financing arms race. At that point, we would expect Lyft to steadily gain market share as the two companies core value propositions become even less differentiated.What do these decreasing marginal returns to route density mean forUbers strategy? Is there some other valuable market where its unprecedented route density might be valuable?Yes. The same economies of scale apply in the last-mile logistics business, where FedEx, UPS and USPS have managed to achieve supreme geographic saturation. Because these companies have drivers on almost every block in America on a daily basis, their marginal cost to deliver one more parcel is as low as $1.50. And if they have two parcels to deliver to the same house, the cost to deliver the second one falls to almost zero.This overwhelming route density has made it nearly impossible for new entrants to gain a foothold in the parcel business. Even DHL, which has a top-three worldwide parcel delivery network, failed in its bid to enter the domestic market, withdrawing in late 2008.ButUberhas a key advantage over even these massive incumbents: While the big parcel players put a driver on every block every day, in metropolitan regionsUberhas drivers on every block every minute.While both FedEx and UPS do offer scheduled pickups, onlyUber(and perhaps someday Lyft) has the density needed to offer instant pickups and on-demand deliveries. This is a game-changer, as it enables a whole new generation of real-time e-commerce experiences.Already customers ofUberPool have shown a willingness to ride with a stranger in exchange for a discount. Surely they would make the same trade to allow the driver to stop to let a customer put apackagein the cars trunk. And if the driver stopped to deliver apackage, it also wouldnt feel much different from the currentUberPool experience.Likely the same driver wouldnt need to pick up and then deliver the parcel as with courier services like Postmates. Rather the driver would simply accumulate packages in the trunk throughout the day, then drop them all off at a consolidation center at the end of their shift.Uberhas already begun their shift toward becoming a real-time logistics network, rather than a mere ridesharing service. Theyve launchedUberCargo in Hong Kong andUberRush in New York City. For the time being, those services use separate networks of cargo vans and bike messengers, respectively. But its only a matter of time before we seeUberroll out parcel solutions that leverage their dense network of ridesharing drivers.The first order analysis of why this matters is obvious: Logistics is 12 percent of global GDP, so the parcel business represents a huge new revenue stream forUber. The second order analysis is perhaps more interesting: Parcels and people can cross subsidize each other, so by co-existing, the two services are cheaper than either could be alone.Parcel delivery serviceswillbecome a powerful lever forUberin its rivalry with Lyft. Suddenly Uberchanging its tagline from Everyones private driver to Where lifestyle meets logistics makes a lot more sense. Pulling off that change all the way back in 2013 shows thatUberhas one of the most forward-looking management teams in business.
