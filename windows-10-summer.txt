Microsoft confirmed today that Windows 10 will launch this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages. Frustratingly, though, the company isnt dishing an actual launch date for itshotly-anticipated new platform, but an interesting new nugget of information was let outtoday.The company previously voiced its intention to offer free upgrades to millions of customers on Windows 7 or earlier, and China  a market synonymous with piracy  is a key focus of that initiative.Speaking at an event inShenzhen, China,Terry Myerson  Microsofts Executive Vice President of Operating Systems  revealed that the Redmond firm will work with three of Chinas most prominent software companies Lenovo, Tencent and Qihoo 360  to offer free upgrades to their collective customer base. That doubtless spansa huge number of potential users.But, theres more, Microsoft is also working Xiaomi  yes, the fast-growing Android phone company  in a partnership that will give selected owners of its Mi 4 the chance to help test Windows 10 and contribute to its future release later this year.Xiaomi has a strong community of users  the company pushes software updates weekly and actively solicits user feedback  and Microsoft is tapping into thatto seedaWindows 10 Technical Preview for initial feedback.A Xiaomi spokesperson told us that this is an experimental program entirely led by Microsoft, and weare trying to ascertain more information about the nature of this partnership.
