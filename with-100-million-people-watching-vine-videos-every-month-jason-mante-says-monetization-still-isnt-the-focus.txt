Twitter now owns Vine, which has a large, vibrant user base. And still, there are no plans to make money off of it just yet,Vines head of user experience Jason Mante said on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY.Would we like to make money sometime? Sure, of course, Mante said. With Vine were focused on making sure we make an amazing product. Were just two years old  were still pretty new. We want toimprove the experience and make it amazing.Mante said 100 million people watch Vine videos on mobile and on the web every month  a numberTwitterthrewout late last year. Twitter acquired Vine in 2012 when itdidnt have a product yet.Still, Mante said the goal was not to usurp TV, nor was Instagram a competitor. Vine intentionally set constraints on the app in order to getrid of the things that get in the way of helping you tell a good story, Mante said. Vine has tools for cutting and splicing the video, while Instagrams video-capture tool has an extensive suite of tools for adding filters.Vine has also said it has more than 1 billion loops that are played every day  a metric Vine created that felt natural for the platform, Mante said. There are some people who create content that viewers watch once or twice, or theyre obsessed with it and they watch it over and over again.Vine has built a vibrant network of creators that not only make videos for Vine, but also make money off those videos. Thanks to platforms like Niche, Vine stars are able to connect with brands and create sponsored content. Twitter acquired Niche earlier this year.We kind of think of ourselves as more of an entertainment network somewhere in between those two worlds, he said.
