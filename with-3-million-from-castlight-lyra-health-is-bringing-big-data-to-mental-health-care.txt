One in fiveAmericans suffers from a diagnosable mental health or substance disorder, but70 percent are undiagnosed.This fact prompted David Ebersman, former CFO of Facebook and Genentech, to launch Lyra Health earlier this year. Still in the very early stages of development, Lyra has secured $3.1 million in strategic funding from Castlight Health, the Venrock-backed enterprise health company that went public last year.Lyra is building a data-driven platformto identify people at risk of behavioral and mental health conditions, andmake sure theyre being appropriately treated.If a patient undergoes open heart surgery, for instance, that patient has a much higher risk of depression, so Lyra will alert the physician and suggest a diagnostic test.Theres also a human component. Lyra is hiring care managers to help people navigate their healthcare plans and understand treatment options, and check up onpatients once theyve chosen a treatment plan to make sure that its actually working.Mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse are an enormous problem, and as a healthcare system were really underinvested in bringing the right tools to these people, Ebersmansays.The vast majority are either undiagnosed, untreated (because navigating the system can be really difficult), or treated with something thats just not working or hasnt been proven to work, he says.The more data that Lyra is able to accumulate, the better its predictive analytics and treatment suggestion engine will be. Through thepartnership with Castlight Health, Lyra will have access to Castlightsmedical claims and search data to accelerate development.Mental health is one of the biggest problems of American enterprise; its a social problem, and an epidemic that deserves to be treated, says Castlight founder Giovanni Colella, a psychiatrist by training.According to the CDC, depression is estimated to cause 200 million lost workdays each year. Add this loss of productivity to the billions of dollars spent in healthcare costs related to major depressive disorders, and its clear that employers have a huge incentive to keep their employees healthy mentally as well as physically.Ebersmansays that Lyra willprimarily be selling to large health plans, and hopes to partner with additional healthcare organizations over the coming months.
