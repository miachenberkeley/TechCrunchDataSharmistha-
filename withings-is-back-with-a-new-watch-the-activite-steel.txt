French hardware startup Withings has released two smart-ish watches so far  the Activit and the Activit Pop. Today, the company is releasing a new model sitting between these two options, the Activit Steel.Available exclusively on the companys website for $169.95, the Activit Steel comes in a premium stainless steel body like the one on the flagship Withings Activit. But compared to the high end model, it is much cheaper. As a reminder, the Activit costs $450.So whats the difference between the two models? The most obvious one is the strap. With a silicone strap, the Activit Steel seems to have the same silicone strap as the Activit Pop. The Activit Steel also comes in one color  black.There are other minor differences between the Activit Steel in the Activit, such as the index markers and the hands. But it remains pretty minor. Other than that, the Activit Steel is a steal. The aggressive price tag might come from the distribution channel. By selling the Steel exclusively on the companys website, Withings doesnt have to pay distributors.So whats the Withings Activit anyway? Its a fitness tracker built into a nice watch. You pair it with your phone using Bluetooth, and it will then track your steps and sleep cycles. You can find your data in the Withings Health Mate app on iOS and Android. Theres a small hand on the watch indicating your progress every day as well.Compared to other fitness tracker, the Activit is quite good when it comes to swimming. It is water-resistant up to 50 meters, and it automatically detects when youre swimming in order to track your activity.It uses a standard watch battery and very little power, so you just need to change the battery every 8 months, according to the company. Finally, my favorite feature is that your watch automatically displays the correct time. If you fly to another country, your phone should switch to a new time zone thanks to the GPS, and your watch will reflect the time difference. Pretty neat.
