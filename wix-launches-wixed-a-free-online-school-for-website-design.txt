DIY website creator Wix wantsto make starting a career in web design as easy as its made building your own site.Today, the companyis launching WixEd, a free online education program that teaches Wix users everything they need to know to launch their own website design business.The course consists of three parts: Wix Webmaster, whichteachesweb design withthe tools Wix provides, and two business andmarketing classesthat cover all aspects of running a smallbusinesswithintros to SEO, e-commerce, accounting, and photography.A group of Wix instructors are on call to answer questions and reviewthe homework thats assigned after each section, including building a website fora real small business client.Its not only about building websites, its about being the person who is responsible for the online presence of a small business, says Yuval Finkelstein, who is running the WixEd program for Wix. All of the strengths that online marketing had two years ago are now available for small business owners, they just need the professionals that can do it.The Wix team has been quietly developing WixEd for three years, and after about a month in a small beta, theyre reporting that 80 percent of users watch at least two videos, and 30 percent of all videos are watched all the way through.To produce the video content, Wix is collaborating with experts in the givenindustry, whether thats an attorney to speak about copyright law or a Google employee to teach a lesson on Google Analytics.Finkelstein says heexpects the course to take an average of twoto threeweeks to complete, although hesalready seen a couple of power beta users blaze through the entire program in the course of a weekend.With the rise of online education marketplaceslike Coursera and Udemy, Wix is clearly not the only place on the Internet wherepeople can learn the basics of web design and small business operation. SoWixEd has addeda layer of human support, and carefully curated the content to make the course as efficient as possible.We are sharing the minimum theory needed in order to explain the practical side, Finkelstein says. You dont need to learn the whole history of the web and how SEO started to understand what you have to do on your own site.Aside from the millions of small business owners in the U.S. that Finkelstein identifies as a client base for WixEd graduates, it seems reasonable to expect that some portion of Wixs 68 million users would rather hire a certified Wix professional than build their own site.Wixis prepared to scale the program quickly to keep up with demand, and Finkelstein says it will be free forever.
