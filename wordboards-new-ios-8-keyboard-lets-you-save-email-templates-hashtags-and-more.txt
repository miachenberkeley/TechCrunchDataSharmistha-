Ever since Apple introduced support for third-party keyboards in iOS 8, developers have been racing to offer users morefunctionality than whats provided by the stock keyboard alone, whether thats better predictive typing, support for GIFs or different input methods like Swype. A new keyboard app launching today, WordBoard, is insteadfocused on saving you from having to type the same things over and over, including standardized emails.The app was developedby Stuart Hall, whose company Bytesize today has a number of iOS applications on the iTunes App Store, both free and paid. The largestof these, the 7 Minute Workout app, was downloaded 2 million times, and was recentlyacquired by Wahoo Fitness.With WordBoard, he says the idea is to allow users to personalize and program their keyboards with regularly used information,like your email address, mailing address, phone number, favorite hashtags for use on social media, ASCII art or even email template replies.While there are a few keyboard apps that allow you to save commonly used information or favorite phrases  weve looked at OftenType and PhraseBoard before, for example  WordBoards support for email templates could see it appealing more to business users than consumers. With the ability to save longer, customized emails like sales templates, customer support responses, or even just different email signatures for your many hats, WordBoard could prove useful for those who run their businesses from their mobile phones.For consumers, theres also a paid feature that lets you import your hashtags from Twitter and Instagram, in order to set up personalized boards with your favorite tags. This is available for an in-app purchase of $1.99, which also gives you the option to import contacts and create an unlimited number of keys.Since thefree version includes only up to six keys, most will likely want to upgrade in order to utilize WordBoards full functionality. (In a way, thefree download basically allows you to testthe app before committing to buy.)As with mostiOS 8 keyboards, youll have to give the appfull access in settings in order for the form-filling features to work after installation. The company clarifies it only does this to share data between the app and keyboard, and doesnt use other features that full access enables, such asnetwork access.The app is available here on iTunes, and makes a decent addition to your lineup of extra keyboards.
