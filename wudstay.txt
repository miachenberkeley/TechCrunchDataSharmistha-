The internet has revolutionized global travel. I can book a flight and hotel online, and by myself, in minutes, and most of the time Ill get roughly the experience that I expect and pay for.

WudStay wants to standardize affordable accommodation in the South Asian country, and it has launched with $3.5 million in investment to kick things off.Itsdifficult for a traveler in India to book accommodation. When you book for $20, youre never sure what kind of experience youll get.
