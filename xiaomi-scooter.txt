Xiaomi made its name with affordable Android smartphones, but the Beijing-based companys future lies in creating a diverse ecosystem of consumer hardware. Today Xiaomi announced that it will add a self-balancing scooter and new smart TV to its lineup.The television isnt a big surprisecalled Mi TV 3, its a larger (60-inch) version of Xiaomis smart TV with a LG 4K display. Its most significant upgrade, however, is a mainboard that connects to the Mi TVs display with a single wire and can replaced separately without having to buy an entire new smart TV. Like Xiaomis smartphones and other smart TVs, Mi TV 3runs on MIUI, an operating system based on Android.From a business strategy standpoint, the scooter is more notablebecause it is the first product launched by Ninebot, a Xiaomi portfolio company, since it acquired Segway in April, and also Xiaomis first personal mobility device.Called the Ninebot mini, the scooter doesnt have a handle, but instead steers by detecting movements from riders legs and predicting where they want to go. Users can also control the Ninebot mini through a smartphone app (of course).Ninebot claims that the scooter, which weighs 12.8 kilograms, can travel 22 kilometers on a single charge, reach speeds of up to 16 kilometers per hour, and go up 15 degree slopes.Xiaomis hardware lineup already ranges from air and water purifiers to health trackers, but it appears to be especially interested in personal vehicles and mobility devices. In addition to its investment in Ninebot, Xiaomi has also invested in smart bike maker Yunmake and reportedly has set its sights on building an electric car.
