Xiaomis combination of well-speced phones andlow price tags drove the company to over 60 million sales last year. That progress saw it replace Samsung as Chinas top-selling smartphone company and become theworlds third topsellingphone maker in the process.The Chinese companysflagship Mi devices typically retail for around $300  its new Mi Note Pro notably breaksthe $500 barrier for the first time  while its affordable Redmi family is sub-$150.Forcomparison, Apples top of the range iPhones sell for over$1,000 off contract, while the Samsung Note and GalaxyS families are similarly priced. So how can Xiaomi be so aggressive with its pricing?Many theories have been put forward, including claims that Xiaomi sells at cost and makes money from other services.Hugo Barra, the companys VP of International, lifted the lid on some of the companys secret sauce in an interview with TechCrunch in Beijing last week.Barra explained that Xiaomi is able to make priceconcessions thanks to thecombination of a small portfolioandlonger average selling time per device.Importantly,Xiaomi continues to sell older devices (and tweaked versions of them) at reducedprices even afterit releases newermodels.Aproduct that stays on the shelf for 18-24 months  which is most of our products  goes through three or four price cuts.The Mi2 and Mi2s areessentially the same device, for example, Barra explained. The Mi2/Mi2swere on sale for 26 months. The Redmi 1 was first launched in September 2013, and we just announced the Redmi 2 this month, thats 16 months later.Thats important because the longer runway for devices givesXiaomi leverage to secure better component deals with its suppliers.The reason we do these price cuts is because weve managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time, which ends up leavingus with a bigger margin than wed like to have, so we do a price cut, Barra added.The vast majority of the components [in our devices] are still the same, so in terms ofsupply chain and component sourcing, were on the same supply contracts as Redmi 1, which means were still getting the same discounts on components, heexplained. We can continue to ride the cost curve, so the importance of having a very small portfolio is significant  the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.Barra said that the dynamics are very simple, but a commitment to devices for two or three years isnt just about making price cuts. He pointed out that Xiaomi maintains software updates, spare parts and other services that customers require, longer than most companies would.The more focused the portfolio, the more efficient we can be at managing those costs too, he explained.There are other factors that contribute to thecost structure, including Xiaomis lean, online-only marketing focus and its locationclose to manufacturing plants in China , but the management of components and supply chain partnerships is a crucial element.Xiaomi has big plans for expanding beyond Asia this year, which will make itspricing model and supply chainmore important than ever.The company sells its phone using an online-only model in most markets, but it has recently begun testing operator partnerships outside of China. It is runninga limited trial with Airtel in India, and has found partners in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.Barra explained that operator partnerships are difficult in markets where the majority of consumers are on pre-paid tariffs  such as India  but it seems clear that Xiaomi is looking into ways to expand its retail footprint. It sold one million devices in its first five months in India using its flash salesmodel. If it can move beyond that and better meetdemand for its phones in India and other emerging markets, it could vastly increase its salesfigures in 2015.Last year, Xiaomi projected that it would sell 100 million devices this year. It increased its target for 2014 mid-way through the year, but were yet to hear of a new figure for 2015 from the company.
