Xiaomi is back with another reminder that it doesnt just make phones. (Despite dethroning Samsung as the top selling smartphone company in China.) Xiaomis latest device is a GoPro-likecamera which, as weve come to expect, is sellingfor a fraction of its U.S. rivals price.A GoPro Hero, the companys entry-level camera, retails for around $130, butXiaomis Yi Action Camera is available for 399 CNY, thats around $64. Standard caveat here: the device is limited to China, initially at least, where it can be bought via its Mi.com storeusing Xiaomis (usual) flash sale model. The device is being sold by Xiaomi, but it is from partner companyXiaoyi.Yi Action Camera (thats the official English name for the product, Xiaomi told TechCrunch) records video at1080p (60 frames per second) and includes a16-megapixel camerathat usesSonys highly rated Exmor R BSI CMOS image sensor. Thats superior on paper to the Hero, which records at1080p30 or 720p60 and includes a five-megapixel camera.Xiaomi also beats the Hero on memory (its 64 GB allocation is twice as large), and weight (it is 72g compared to 111g), while it has a slightly larger battery. Like the Hero, the Yi Action Camera can go as far as 40 meters underwater, which is probably the most important stat for those of us who like to take a camera near water.One notable absence is the lack of rigging or casing for the camera  unlike GoPros, which ship with some basic accessories.An $80 travel edition of the Yi Action Camera does include a selfie stick mount, especially for those into taking photos of themselves.Beyond that, it appears that the device can be strapped to anything  even a cat?!  but some kind of protective case would be useful, we think.Xiaomis other products  which include an air purifier, andblood test device can be remotely controlled via apps, and thats also the case for the Yi Action Camera.Dont hold your breath on the prospect of seeing this product surface outside of China  thats a common refrain for Xiaomi products, but particularly true in this case.Xiaomis rationale for making anaction camera isnt necessarily to clone GoPro  in the same way that it doesnt clone Apple  itsbecauseitis essentially an internet-of-things company, as Stratechery writer Ben Thompson recently noted.Beyond just developing quality smartphones at strikingly affordable prices, Xiaomi is developing a network of hardware which also connects with its software, its MIUI version of Android, and its dedicated services, such as an iMessage variant and e-commerce store. If Xiaomi can provide all of your hardware needs, for instance, then clearly its software and services will play an important part in your daily life.Hardwarecompanies make their money fromselling devices, but with tight margins and a growing ecosystem of hardware partners, Xiaomi does things differently.International VP Hugo Barra recently told TechCrunch about some strategies that keep its prices so low, but the companys larger goal is also to monetize via those services so keeping device pricing competitive is essential to getting people into its ecosystem.Once you own a Xiaomi smartphone, for example, youre compelled to buy other Xiaomi devices, and thus its ecosystem has value  both to the user and to Xiaomi from a money-making point of view.
