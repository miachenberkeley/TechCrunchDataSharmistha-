In one of those fun, wild science chats, both Google Ventures Bill Maris and XPRIZE head Peter Diamandis discussed a gamut of moonshots, including life extension research, sentientrobots, and self-driving cars versus those that can fly.In the future, the idea of putting a sixteen-year-old behind the wheel of a 5,000-pound machine will seem ludicrous, Diamandis said onstage at the Wall Street Journal Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, Tuesday.Maris added that hisbrand new baby boy probably wouldnt even want to drive. The likelihood of my seven-week-old son wanting a car one day is zero, Maris said.Both Maris and Diamandis are keen on transportation  especially in space. XPRIZE runs the Google Lunar Challenge, a $30 million competition encouraging startups and engineering teams to come up with better ways toboost space exploration.Back to the Futurehad nothing on what transportation will really be like in the future, Maris said, referring to the hit movie trilogy (Oct 21, 2015, aka tomorrow, holds a special place for fans of the movie as the day Doc Brown and Marty McFly travel to the future in a flying car, by the way).However, Maris also noted hedtrade flying cars for the ability to decode DNA. In 1985 we didnt have the tech to decode your DNA, he said.Maris concentrates a heavy amount of investment to the life sciences and has for a good number of years. According to Maris, at least thirty percent of the portfolio focuses on life sciences. Theres a lot of talk of redistribution of wealth, but redistribution of health is more interesting to me. he said.Part of those redistribution investments include food companies like Impossible Foods, a tech startup making a plant-based meat substitute it hopes will shake up the meat industry. Maris, a strict vegetarian has tasted the product and told the packed audience it was disturbingly too close to the real thing.However, both also cautioned against making products that only fit with the Silicon Valley crowd. If we live in a world where the technology were talking about is only for rich white people in Silicon Valley, then weve failed, said Maris.
