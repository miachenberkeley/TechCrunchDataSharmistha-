Unfortunately, with the soft housing market around Richmond,Virginia, he couldnt sell it. So he decided to rent it out instead.Im anaccidental landlord. I bought a townhouse at the height of the market in2005 and then I needed a bigger home, and we really just couldnt sell it.It became a real investment in handling the sublet with finding tenants and then the legal process ofkeeping in compliance with fair housing, Barrett said. There wasnt reallyanything out there in the marketplace.So he, Chris Stewart and Brandon Anderson foundedTenant Turner to help landlords source and choose qualified tenants while following laws like Fair Housing regulations. Theyve raised$500,000 from Y Combinator, Lighthouse Labs, Triad LC, Altron Capital, Duke Dodson, Doug White, Daniil Kleyman, and Jim Cheng.Tenant Turner automatically lists properties on the top 20 listings sits.
