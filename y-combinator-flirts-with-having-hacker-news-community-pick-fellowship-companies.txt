Upvotes! What are they good for? Soon, they might get your very, very early-stage company into Y Combinator. The incubator is experimenting with using the Hacker News community to pick startups for its Fellowship program.HN moderator Daniel Gackle, AKA dang, posted in the sites Ask HN section with initial details:Perhaps if HN picked startups, it would pick differently than YC. Maybe different startups would be motivated to apply, if they knew that the interviewing and deciding would be done by the HN community. Interesting things might happen, or they might not. Wed have to try it and see.Your submission should be very early stage, no investment, but ready to have the tires kicked. You should be ready to go full-time on it for eight weeks.At the end of April, the submissions will be ranked by upvotes and the quality of discussion, (tiebreakers TBA). Chosen ideas or projects will join this summers YC Fellowship, which awards $20,000 (at the price of 1.5 percent equity) and the mentorship of experts at the accelerator (priceless).Its unlikely anyone really thinks this will go off without a hitch  putting real money and opportunity in the hands of the hoi polloi rarely does  but $40,000 is a small investment for YC to find out whether this could be an interesting way to entice young, impressionable startups into their lair.The discussion is ongoing at this HN thread. Go be nice!
