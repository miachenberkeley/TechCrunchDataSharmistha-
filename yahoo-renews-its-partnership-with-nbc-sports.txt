Today, Yahoo announced that one of their crown jewels, its relationship with NBC Sports, has been renewed.In a post, Ian Weingarten, SVP, Corporate Development and Partnerships, said:Weve renewed our partnership with NBC Sports Group, bringing even more content to Yahoo/NBC Sports viewers, including Premier League highlights, NBC Sports Regional Network team reports, and Golf Channel. The partnership also now delivers the experience beyond the desktop to our mobile and Tumblr users.Yahoo Sports and NBC Sports Digital will continue to collaborate on premium sports news and events coverage both online and on-air on NBC, NBCSN, Golf Channel, NBC Sports Regional Networks, NBCSports.com and Yahoo, while maintaining separate sites and editorial control of our respective newsrooms and digital properties.Its hard to argue that one of the few areas where Yahoo still has very active users and interesting relationships is with sports. Sure, the Daily Fantasy stuff might come to an end if the government has its druthers, but this content partnership is key for a company still fighting to find relevance across the internet.
