Earlier today, Y Combinator President Sam Altman posted the type of numbers about which he gets asked a lot  calling them (humbly and probablyrightly) very imperfect indicators of success.Heres the lowdown, if you missed them: Excluding companies like Quora that didnt get their start with the incubator, Altman says that YC has now backed roughly940 companies altogether, and nearly a third  or around 300  have shut down.Many of its survivors are thriving, though.Consider: The total money raised by all YC companies exceeds $7 billion, Altman says. (Altman tweeted on Friday that YCs winter batch alone has already attracted $227 million from investors.)More stunning, those companies are collectively valued at more than $65 billion (on paper).Broken down further, Altman writes that YC has now produced more than 40 companies that are valued at more than $100 million by investors.He doesnt name any startups, but there are plenty of brandsyoud recognize in this group, including Reddit, the currently beleaguered community news sharing site, which reportedly raised $50 million at a $500 million valuation a year ago.Altmanalso notes there are now seven YC-backed, still-private companies that are valued at more than $1 billion by investors.Thats a lot of unicorns, particularly given these are companies that were largely incubated at YC.
