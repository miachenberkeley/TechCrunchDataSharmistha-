Cleanly, the YC-backed startup that handles all of your laundry needs with the push of a button, has today announced it will expand service from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Neighborhoods that will receive Cleanly service include Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, Ft. Greene, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Dumbo and Downtown Brooklyn.Cleanly works like this:Users download the app, entertheir address and payment information, and set a time for their laundry to be picked up. That timeframe can range between 30 minutes out or a few hours out, and Cleanly offers a 24-hour turnaround.The Cleanly team has a background in logistics, leading them to build out a back-end version of the app for valets that is actually constantly improving their service. Alongside the ability to choose their shift times, Cleanly valets are also asked to input specific information about pick-up and drop-off locations (such as doorman, buzzer, gates, parking issues, etc.).This allows Cleanly to get faster and faster with operations, based on factors outside of general distance and traffic.Cleanly taps large-scale laundromats to handle the washing, drying and folding of the clothes.The service costs $1.50/lb for regular wash-and-dry laundry, and charges on a per-item basis for dry cleaning. The app offers a full breakdown of the bill after every cleaning.This May, Cleanly picked up $2.3 million in seed from investors like Ludlow Ventures, Initialized Capital, Paul Buchheit, Semil Shah from Haystack, Joe Montana, 500 Startups, Funders Club, Soma Capital, Altair Capital and Chloe Sladden from #Angels.If you want to learn more about Cleanly, hit up the website here.
