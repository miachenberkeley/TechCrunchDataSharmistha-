Launching out of the Summer 2015 Y Combinator batch, Locent is an e-commerce platform powered entirely by text messages.One of the biggest challenges for online retailers is shepherding customers through a lengthy checkout process. By providing businesses with a custom, text-enabled phone number, Locent turns the checkout process into just a text message.Heres how retailers use the service: After creating an account and being assigned a custom number, stores can use Locents backend to create different items, complete with price, photo, and keyword.When a user texts that keyword to a stores number, they automatically get a link to a payment form to complete the transaction from their phone.While Locent eventually is planning to targetphysical and online retailers, they are currently focused on helping brands and influencers sell through existing marketing channels.For example, the company recently teamed up with Shonduras, a Snapchat celebrity, to push out a Locent-enabled phone number thatwould reply to fans with a link to subscribe to a Twitch channel. Over a 12-hour span the number received more than 8,000 texts from fans, who instantly received a reply with the Twitch channel link.Matt Joseph and Ryan MacInnes, co-founders of Locent, explained that their service lets any marketing channel become a one-click point of sale.The company is also looking into usingLocent as a donation platform, especially with 2016 presidential candidates as they begin fundraising campaigns. For example, politicianscould be on stage at an event and give our their Locent number, which users could text to instantly receive a donation page.Whilethe service is built on top of known platforms like Twilio and Stripe, Locent ties these technologies together into a platform that is easy for all business owners to use.For this convenience, the company is charging retailers a 3percent commission, which is on top of Stripes fees (2.9 percent + 30 cents).Locent has raised $630,000 in seed funding from Y Combinator and Chaac Ventures.
