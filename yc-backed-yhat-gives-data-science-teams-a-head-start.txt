Yhat founders Greg Lamp and Austin Ogilvie were working with a team of data scientistsat OnDeck, a successful small business loan startup, when they noticed a problem.The data science team was coming up with cool ideas, but the engineers couldnt implement these applications, as fast as they could produce them, simply because they lacked the tools to do it. Thats when they decidedto create a tool that would give these teams a head start toward working more efficiently. That tool would becomeYhat (pronounced Y-hat).We had a team of data scientists who produced new and creative ways of doing businessand decision making, and engineeringcouldnt keep up with the data science team.Austin and I were both workingin the middle of this and watchingall of this analytical work at OnDeckjust sitting on shelves, Lamp explained.They figured there had to be a better way toget value from the work the data scientists were producing.With their first product, ScienceOps, they developed a solution designed to help teams of data scientists work and communicate more effectively with one another as they built projects on top of popular data science tools like R and Python  but they didnt stop there.They also wanted to make it easier for the engineers and the lines of business to implement those applications to benefit the companyby putting the ideas to work more quickly.They kept their day jobs for a short time, but by June, 2013they saw so much demand, they left OnDeck and started Yhat. For a time, they were working out of their Brooklyn apartment, but they soon out-grew that and moved into a shared office space in Manhattan where they are today.The company began to ramp up in earnest in 2013 when they got a cool million in seed money, and they are currentlypart of the Y Combinator 2015 winter class.Lamp says that, because they were already somewhat established and even had customers, they werent sure what YC could give them. As Lamp put it, we were a lot further along than two hackers with an idea. They worried that it might actually be a distraction, but its been fantastic so far, he says.Both founders agree that its been a great experience and their batch teammates have helped them focus. They realize now that as new entrepreneurs, they didnt know what they didnt know and YC has helped them take a range of problems any new company has to deal with, and filter them objectively to concentrate on the ones that matter most.For Yhat, a startup with a more mature idea, that has meant working on sales and prospects, whereas some of the newer startups might concentrate moreon marketing and product development.Yhat announced a second product called ScienceBox in June, 2014, which is a lower cost alternative,designed to help data scientists create and share data science projects.Yhat has some interesting customers including a NASCAR racing team that is trying to figure out how to use data to get an edge byenhancing pit decision making.The NASCAR team sees [big data]as a new thing they know they should be doing, but they know they are behind, and are looking to get ahead of the curve, Lamp explained.Another client is CondNast. You might not think of a publishing company being data-driven but it has a team of 40 or 50 data scientists spread across a couple of different locations, soYhats products appeal to them.Lamp saysScienceBox has also been popular with data science professors as a way to deliver all the tools that participants need to take the class. Prior to using using ScienceBox, it took a lot of work to ramp up andget all of the students set up.Lamp andOgilvie acknowledge that, while theyve been able to build a decent customer base, they may be a bit ahead of the industry where many companies have two or fewer data scientists. They admit that theyve thought about that, but so far they have plenty of business for a companywith just seven employees.Whats more, Lamp said that data science is the fastest growing undergraduate major, and many folks in academia are leaving for lucrative jobs in industry. We may not be in the data science golden age just yet, but Yhats timing appears to be pretty good.In case youre wondering about the company name  I know I was  it actually comes from a German statistical measurement, kind of a data scientist in-joke.Lamp says their target audience gets the joke, even if they have to explain it to everyone else.
