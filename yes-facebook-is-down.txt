Yes, friends, the (not really) unimaginable has happened: the titan that is Facebook is down.We dont usually raise our eyebrows too high when Facebook goes down for a minute, but its been in and out for a good 20 (update: 30!) minutes now. For a company that makes millions in revenue per day, every minute is tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue lost.Weve hit up Facebook to try and figure out whats going on.

Update: After 35-40 minutes of outage, some are reporting that its back online. Others are reporting its still down. Sounds like its coming back online on a server-by-server basis.Update #2:  Looks like its back up for most people now.
