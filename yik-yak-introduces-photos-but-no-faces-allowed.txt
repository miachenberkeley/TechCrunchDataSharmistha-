Yik Yak wants to let you share what youre seeing without anyone knowing who you are.The anonymous social apptoday announced that users will now be able to share photos on the service.The company had previously been testing photos in a few Yik Yak communities, but will now roll out the feature to all users.The company will be moderating photos before they appear in the Yik Yak feed, and (as expected) will have a lot of restrictions. These include no inappropriate photos (the company defines this as anything you wouldnt send to your mother), orillegal content.Notably, the service is also banning faces in local feeds.However, photos of people will be allowed in photo collections withinthe Explore section of Peek, which has a broader audience than just yourspecific campus or city.More specifically, these collectionswill display a grid of popular photographs submittedfrom anyone in a specificedlocation.The company is also introducing phone number verification to help combat spam (and presumably inappropriate posts)andwill mark the first time that Yakkerswill have to sacrifice their total anonymity.This seems like a small price to pay to keep spammers from constantly starting new accounts, especially sinceposters will still be 100 percent anonymous to other users in the app.Yik Yak is still trying to preserve much of the look and feel of its text-heavy app by having photosappear assmall thumbnails in postson the Nearby and My Heard pages.Now defunct competitor Secret wasnt so wise when it shocked its community with a massive redesign that cloned Yik Yaks interface and ditched the full-size photos it was known for.The company is rolling out photos over the next few days, and also teased that more photo features will come very soon.
