If youre a real fan of the newly redesigned Yahoo Mail, but also use Gmail, today is your day. Seriously, throw a damn party.The Yahoo Mail team announced that you can now manage your Gmail from the friendly confines of Yahoo Mail, to go along with previous support for Outlook, Hotmail and AOL Mail (you know, the other email services that nobody uses unless its for Craigslist purposes):When we launched the redesigned Yahoo Mail app in October, users called it slick, speedy and elegant. The app now has a four-star rating in both the Apple App Store and Google Play. We introduced multiple mailbox management for Outlook.com, Hotmail and AOL Mail. Yet, something was missing from the list  the ability to connect your Gmail and Google Apps account to Yahoo Mail. You asked for it and now its here!Why would you want to do this? Yahoo says you can take advantage of everything that their flavor of email has to offer: powerful search, smart contacts, rich compose features and Yahoo Account Key for password-free sign-in. So there you have it.Its available for Yahoo Mail on the web, iOS and Android.
