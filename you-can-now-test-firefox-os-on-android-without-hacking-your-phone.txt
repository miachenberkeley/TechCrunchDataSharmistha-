Lets say you want to give Firefox OS  the mobile operating system made by the same people who make the browser  a try.Until now, thats meant one of two things: buying one of a small handful of early Firefox OS devices or hacking your existing Android device to pieces to try toget it running.Thats starting to change today. Mozilla is releasing a preview build that runs within Android to give you a taste without any real commitment required.The catch? They are shoehorning an OS on top of another OS, so the two might interact strangely sometimes  particularly at this early stage. For example, Mozilla says Androids back button can cause some weird bugs at times.But fret not: if its too buggy or youre just not feelin it, just remove Firefox OS as you would any other launcher, and youre back to square one.Ready to check it out?
