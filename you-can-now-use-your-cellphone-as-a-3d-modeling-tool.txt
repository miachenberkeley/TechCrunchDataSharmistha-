Researchers have created a new technology that uses the camera and accelerometers in an average cellphone to measure real objects in 3D space. Created at Carnegie Mellon University, you can use the system to build 3D models of the world just by waving your phone around an object or scene.The accelerometers, called inertial measurement units, roughly tell the phones software the position of the phone in space. IMUs are very noisy and rarely usable to truly assess a phones actual orientation with any degree of real accuracy but coupled with the camera you can get far more useful results.Weve been able to get accuracies with cheap sensors that we hadnt imagined, said Simon Lucey, associate research professor in the CMU Robotics Institute in a release. With a face tracker program, we are able to measure the distance between a persons pupils within half a millimeter. Such measurements would be useful for applications such as virtual shopping for eyeglass frames.The tool allows for better computer vision and could mean that you could create a 3D model of almost anything with your smartphone alone. The researchers expect to use this in self-driving cars, bypassing expensive and power-hungry radar. The team used the technology to create something called Smart Fit that finds the perfect glasses frames for your face.The trajectory we create with these cheap IMUs will drift over time, but the vision element we create is very accurate, said Lucey. So we can use the 3-D model to correct for the errors caused by the IMU, even as we use the IMU to estimate the dimensions of the model.
