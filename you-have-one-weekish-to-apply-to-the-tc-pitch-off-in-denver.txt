We talk about the meaning of life.Its a great night, but in order to make it awesome we need the best and brightest startups in Colorado to participate.Sound like you?Applications for the pitch-off close on Friday, September 18, so head over here and apply now.If youre looking to pick up tickets to the event, which will be held at 1644 Platte Street in Denver at 6pm, you can find those right here.See you soon, Denver!
