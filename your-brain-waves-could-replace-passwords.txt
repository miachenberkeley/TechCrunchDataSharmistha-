Researchers at Binghamton University have discovered that, with a bit of training, your computer can identify you based on the way your brain reacts to certain words. This means that instead of a password you could simply listen to a few words and unlock your super secret files.From the release:In short, you sit down with a brain scanner on and the computer gives you a few words. Depending on your reaction to those words it lets you into the super-secret computer system (or Facebook) or it rejects you. Obviously 94 percent accuracy isnt ideal but it can be improved. Interestingly, these brainprints are as unique as fingerprints but actually malleable.If someones fingerprint is stolen, that person cant just grow a new finger to replace the compromised fingerprint  the fingerprint for that person is compromised forever. Fingerprints are non-cancellable. Brainprints, on the other hand, are potentially cancellable. So, in the unlikely event that attackers were actually able to steal a brainprint from an authorized user, the authorized user could then reset their brainprint, said Sarah Laszlo, an assistant professor of psychology and linguistics involved in the project.Will we be connecting our logins to our brains any time soon? Probably not, but this could be an interesting solution for very high-security systems and/or your Twitter account.
