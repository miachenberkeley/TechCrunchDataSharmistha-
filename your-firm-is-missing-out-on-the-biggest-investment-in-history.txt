Try50.4 percentof the population. Today, women are the largest emerging investibleclass across the globe. Only2.7 percentof venture capital-funded companies have a female CEO, and even in the36.2 percent of non-farm businessesthat are woman-owned, women only earned11.3 percent of the revenue.Women-owned businesses tend to perform better and typicallyreinvest moreback into their communities. But these companies rarely see the investments they deserve, and if the venture capitalist community doesnt pay attention, these companies will be forced to seek other forms of funding.Beforecrowdsourcing, if a business didnt receive venture capitalist funding, no one would touch it  and because of the old boys club of investing, women have rarely gotten the investments they deserve.But now,venture capital firms arent the be-all, end-all for raising capital. In the age of GoFundMe andKickstarter, its possible that younger startups will begin to move away from the standard venture capital model and more toward alternative methods of fundraising. Many women-owned businesses or organizations have gotten public financing, whether through grant money or government funding.If venture capitalists want to stay competitive, they need to pay attention to women-owned businesses. But whats kept them from paying attention in the first place?Lack of access and lack of awareness have been the main factors preventing women from getting the investment opportunities they deserve. Many women dont have access to these male-dominated organizations, and thats where some of the distribution anddisruptionof capital formation marketing comes in.Venture capitalists arent seekingwomen-owned companies, so there is an absence of capital flowing toward this talent, which perpetuates the gap in access for and awareness of women-owned businesses. When investors seek to finance these companies, that gap will begin to close, and both the investor and the entrepreneur will see results.Whether people are aware of it or not, women-owned businesses are excelling. Datacollected in 2013shows thatmore than8.6 million businesses in the United States are owned by women, and these businesses are generating more than$1.3 trillion in revenue and employing almost 7.8 million people. The number of women-owned firms isincreasing fasterthan the number of men-owned businesses across the board. Does that sound like a sector worth investing in?Ideally, we wouldnt have to talk about this issue because all businesses would have equal opportunities to succeed. But the current state of venture capital firm investment in women is deplorable, and theres a pressing need for differentiation between women-owned companies and men-owned companies because of this clear gap in revenue and funding.There are great initiatives in the marketplace that elevate women in business  High Water Women,Its Time Network, andSpringboard Enterprisesare examples but the business world could benefit from continued visibility, awareness and mentoring for women-owned companies. And while these businesses certainly provide education to women-owned businesses, women still need access to capital to back up their knowledgeand expand their businesses.Venture capital firms can also improve the way they look at investing in women-run startups and be more intentional about bringing women into their firms. It all comes down to outreach and engagement. Venture capital firms need to collaborate with womens organizations and groups in order to understand the opportunities available to them as far as capital investments are concerned. Look at places likeIMPACT Leadership 21, which has created entire public forums to foster conversations between women and men in the business world.Considering thecrowdsourcingcommunity, venture capital firms should embrace companies who have had those types of opportunities in order to seek more women-owned businesses. These firms could invest in what was initially an alternatively funded company that has gone through a cycle of development and is now at a stage where it could benefit from venture capital funding.If you look across the world at the female population, its easy to see that they represent the largest investment opportunity there is.Lets level the playing field and eliminate access barriers to established firms and funds so that both venture capital firms and women-owned businesses (soon to be known as businesses) will be able to mutually flourish.
