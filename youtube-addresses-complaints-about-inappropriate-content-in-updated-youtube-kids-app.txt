When YouTube first launched its dedicated Kids app earlier this year, parents welcomed the opportunityto be able to keep their children away from the more adult content found on the larger YouTube network, thanks to the new apps curated selection of kid-friendlyvideos. But the app soon came under fire from consumer watchdog groups who claimed YouTube was not doing enough to protect kids from inappropriate content, including references to sex, drugs, alcohol and more.Now, YouTube is beginning to address thisproblem with an update thatwillhelp parentsbetter restrict the type of content a child can access on YouTube Kids.This feature and more, including Chromecast and Apple TV support as well as guest-curated playlists, will arrive in an newversion of the app due in a few weeks time, says YouTube.The problem YouTube Kids means to address was significant.Children today regularly visit YouTube for things like educational videos, cartoons,music videos, web series, and much more. But because the site lacked easy-to-implement parental controls, kids would often stumble upon content through YouTubes recommendations on via search which was not exactly kid-safe. For example, an innocent search for Elmo videos could see kids ending up on a video ofElmo cursing.Instead, with YouTube Kids, the idea was to offer a simplified user interface for interacting with YouTube where videos were vetted and curated into high-level categories likeShows, Music, Learning, and Explore.Developed after consultation withCommon Sense Media, ConnectSafely.org, the Family Online Safety Institute, the Internet Keep Safe Coalition (iKeepSafe) and WiredSafety.org, YouTube Kids app isfilled with content fromwell-known childrens entertainment brands like DreamWorks TV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends, National Geographic Kids, Reading Rainbow, and Thomas the Tank Engine, plus other shows from YouTubers like Vlogbrothers and Stampylonghead.Dealing With Inappropriate ContentBut the problem with the app  and one which led to FTC complaints  was that YouTube Kids offered a search feature that could lead kids to videos that hadnt been explicitly included and organized into the apps various sections. While that option could be disabled in parental controls, it seemed that many didnt know it existed.Two consumer groups,the Center for Digital Democracy and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, teamed up to show how that search feature could be usedto point kids to very inappropriate videos.They used the app to findvideos that included sexual language, unsafe behaviors (like playing with matches or juggling knives), profanity (e.g. in a parody of the film Casino featuring Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street), adult discussions about family violence, pornography, and child abuse, jokes about drug use and pedophilia, and alcohol ads.YouTube today says it will make a change to YouTube Kids that will now explain to parents how videos are chosen and how they can be flagged, and it will force parents to make a decision about how much access they want their child to have. In short, parents will be asked toeither enable or disable the search feature. When disabled, kids will be restricted to a more limited set of videos in the app.Also new is the ability for parents to set a passcode instead of a spelled-out code.However, as YouTube reminds parents in a blog post, no system is perfect  while noting that parents should flag concerning videos if they leak through. These flagged videos are manually reviewed 24/7 and any that shouldnt be included are removed within hours.The larger issue at hand isthat YouTube housesa lot of content, and its catalog grows at an incredible pace with hundreds of hours of videobeing uploaded every minute. That means that YouTube cantfilter all the content for the Kids app by hand  instead, it uses a combination of algorithmic filtering, user input and human review. And without 100 percent manual curation, bad videos can slip through.That means simply installing the Kids version of YouTube on your mobile device will never be a replacement for actual parental supervision. Its just an improvement overthe main YouTube app.YouTube Kids And AdsThough not mentioned in todays post, YouTube is taking a stand onanother issue raised by consumers in complaints tothe FTC  advertising. The groups said YouTube was mixing content and ads in a way that was deceptive to children. In particular, the groups were concerned with paid endorsements where the relationship between a videos star and product manufacturer was not disclosed.YouTubes position is that paid ads are allowed in the app and they will be marked as such. But any video uploaded by a user is not considered an ad and wont be subject to YouTubes advertising guidelines. That, we understand from those familiar with the situation, means the user videos can include certain commercials and other promotional materials.For example, a search for cookies on the app may show a television commercial from a cookie company on a users channel  but YouTubewould not consider this video a Paid Ad and it would not be subject to YouTubesAds policies.The only requirement for the user videos is that theyre kid-friendly.That being said, creators are asked to disclose if videos are paid endorsements, and those that are are excluded from the YouTube Kids app as a matter of policy (if not practice.) Creators are also pointed to a page that details how such videos should be labeled.We understand the FTC investigation into the complaints against YouTube is ongoing but are waiting to hear back on the detailed status.Along with these more serious issues, YouTube today is alsopromoting a handful of other features in the updated app including support for watching YouTube Kids on TV viaChromecast, Apple TV, game consoles andsmartTVs as well as new guest-created playlists fromNational Geographic Kids, Kid President, a girl power-themed playlist from actor Geena Davis,creators including Vsauce and Amy Poehlers Smart Girls, and others.The company says the app has seen over 8 million downloads since its February launch.
