YouTube announced a new ad format today thats all about brevity.In a blog post, Product Manager Zach Lupei said YouTube has been exploring formats that are better-suited for smartphone video watchers. Hence the creation of Bumper ads  video ads that are only six seconds long.The idea of a really short ad isnt new  the name suggests that the inspiration comes from those brief bumper videos you see on TV. And it makes sense that as online videos get shorter, ads will follow suit. (Its not great when yousit through a 30-second pre-roll to get to a video that isnt much longer.)At the same time, YouTube is pitching this as a complement, rather than a replacement, to its existing ad formats. The idea is that an advertiser could run a YouTube campaign centered on a longer video, then use the brief Bumper ads to reinforce the message or reach more viewers. And since theyre so short, the Bumperswont be skippable.We like to think of Bumper ads as little haikus of video ads  and were excited to see what the creative community will do with them, Lupei wrote, adding that theyll be available to advertisers in May.
