Confirmingreports from last fall, YouTube announced today its plans for an ad-free, subscription-based service by way of an email sent out to YouTube Partners. The email details the forthcoming option, which will offer consumers the choice to pay for an ads-free version of YouTube for a monthly fee.The additional monetization option requires partners to agree to updated terms on YouTubes Creator Studio Dashboard, which notes that the changes will go into effect on June 15, 2015.The email touts the potential for YouTube Creators to generate additional income beyond whats available today through advertising and speaks of the subscription service as something that will excite your fansand generate a previously untapped, additional source of revenue for you.YouTubes plans to move into subscriptions have been underway for some time. In October,YouTube head Susan Wojcicki, who had been spearheading the monetization efforts, explained at the Code Mobile conference that the option would especially appeal to mobile viewers who are increasingly interested inavoiding advertisements. With the subscription model in place, YouTube would begin to resemble something thats more like Netflix  a place where consumers pay for access to content that can be streamed on-demand, uninterrupted.According to YouTubesupdated Partner Program Terms, YouTube will pay creators 55 percent of the total net revenues from subscription fees  this is the same percentage associated with advertising revenues. Specifically, the updated Termsstates:YouTube will pay you 55% of the total net revenues recognized by YouTube from subscription fees that are attributable to the monthly views or watchtime of your Content as a percentage of the monthly views or watchtime of all or a subset of participating content in the relevant subscription offering (as determined by YouTube). If your Content is included in and viewed by a user in multiple subscription offerings, YouTube will pay you based on the subscription offering with the highest amount of net revenues recognized by YouTube, as calculated by YouTube.One thing that neither the letter to creators nor the updated Terms references is the price of the subscription offering. Nor does it disclose when the service will be offered to the public. The June 15 date references when the Terms changes go into effect, but this doesnt necessarily mean that the service will be immediately public to all YouTube users at that time. It could be a staged roll out, or YouTube could have simply wanted the legalese in place ahead of the broader subscription services launch. However, sources told Bloomberg the offering is expected to go live this year.We understand the reason the time frame and the pricing werenot disclosed in the letter to partners is because thats something thats still yet to be determined.This is not the first subscription service to be offered by YouTube, as you may recall. In November 2014, thecompany debuted Music Key, a subscription offering thatprovides consumers with access to Google Plays entire library, as well as ads-free music videos. During its beta period, that service was priced at $7.99 per month  a discount from the $9.99 standard price. It additionally includes offline access, which is something that will likely arrive in the new offering, as well.YouTubessubscription-based offering could also mean increased competitionfor startups like Vessel, the so-called Hulu for the YouTube generation, from Hulus former CEO Jason Kilar. Vessel is offering a subscription-based service for $2.99 per month, which provides early access to videos consumers would normally watch for free on YouTube, and has been reaching out to creators to participate.YouTube offered us the following comment when asked for more information on the program details:While we cant comment on ongoing discussions, giving fans more choice to enjoy the content they love and creators more opportunity to earn revenue are always amongst our top priorities.The full letter to YouTube partnersis pasted below; screenshots of the email, terms and dashboard are above:Dear YouTube Partner,Your fans want choices.
