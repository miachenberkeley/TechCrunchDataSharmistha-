You use YouTube, everyone uses YouTube, so you know the 301+ number that this headline refers to. Before a video goes bananas with views, it gets paused at 301+ for some period of time just to make sure that the counts arent being fluffed up by bots.Sure, its a nice notion, but man is it annoying. Today, YouTube dropped a tweet letting everyone know that theyre doing away with that practice.Yay!This has been a pain in the ass for a while, with people constantly asking both Google and YouTube why their view counts are frozen. Theres even avideo about it.Heres a little bit more information on why YouTube embraced this practice in the first place, and how it can now drop it.Only after a few hours would the number jump up past 301+, while YouTube verified those views. The training wheels are off for the most part, but the player will only show view numbers that YouTube is confident are real early on, just to be safe.
