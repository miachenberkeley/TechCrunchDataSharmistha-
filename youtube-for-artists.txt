As big as billion-user YouTube is, its ad revenue sharing is not where musicians make their money. They earn it on the road. But YouTubes reach can make artists famous all over the world. Now its going to show musicians exactly where those fans are so they can route their concert tours there and squeeze $30 out of people who watchtheir videos for free.Music Insights is a new tool thats part of Googles YouTube For Artists initiative to lend creators a hand. It shows the cities where a musician is most popular and which of their songs are most popular, as well asaggregates the views of all their own videos and those uploaded by fans that feature their songs recognized by Content ID.YouTubes group product manager on Music InsightsDavid Kingtells me We have a huge audience across the world for music and we want to help artists understand how their music is being consumed across that audience.Heres how each of those data points will help artists:Top Cities  Shows artists where to plan concerts. They might discover foreign countries where they have a surprisingly large following, or that they have more fans in a smaller city like Oakland than its bigger neighbor San Francisco. It could also help them to convince radio stations in those cities to play them.Top Songs  Tells artists what songs they should pitch to radio as singles, send to prospective record labels, try to license to TV shows or commercials, re-record for their next album, or otherwise promote.Aggregated View Counts  Gives artists a number they can cite to show their popularity. YouTube already shows a total view count for an accounts own videos. But this number includes fan-uploaded videos that use the musicians songs as soundtracks. This way, an artist could tell a record label or radio station that Not only do we have 10 million views of our videos, we also have 10 million more views of videos posted of our music by fans, showing how much grassroots support we have.YouTubes not the first music service hoping to endear itself to artists by offering them analytics. Pandoras Artist Marketing Platform and Spotify For Artists provide similar data.When asked why YouTubes data is better, King said YouTube remains unique in its global audience and the breadth of that audience. While the two services you just mentioned have a good sized audience, neither has the global reach that we have. Pandoras 80 million and Spotifys 60 million listeners dont stack up anywhere close to YouTubes billion-plus.Eventually, King says YouTube wants to provide this data through an API so artists and their teams can access and manipulate the information more nimbly and combine it with other analytics.Data now shows us the direct effects of all of our marketing efforts small and large, online and off saysDan Kruchkow, CMO and Head of Digital Strategy at Crush Music, which manages major musicians like Fall Out Boy and Train.The launch comes as YouTube is trying to repair its image with artists after a snafu regarding contracts for its upcoming paid subscription version. After confusing terms led to perceived harshness on YouTubes part, some artists loudly complained in January.YouTube previewed the Music Insights tool at a party at SXSW 2015But YouTubes been actively trying to provide more ways to assist musicians, as views of their videos make up a huge portion of its engagement. Beyond its existing analytics about how long videos were viewed, in March it launched Info Cards that artists can overlay on their video to display tour or merch info. Its Fan Funding feature lets viewers digitally tip cash to their favorite performers.Each music streaming service isnt just competing for listeners. Theyre fighting to be the first profile artists promote. If YouTube can offer the most actionable analytics, it will incentivize artists to trumpet their YouTube channel over everything else.
