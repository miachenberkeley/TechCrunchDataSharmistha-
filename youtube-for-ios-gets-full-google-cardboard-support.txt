As the tech world waits to see what VR stuff Google shows off at its I/O conference later this week, today, the company snuck in an update to YouTube for iOS that allows you to view any video in VR mode on Cardboard.YouTubes Android app has had full Cardboard support since November, but iPhone users have been sorely out of luck. With todays release, iOS users can now tap the icon in the top-right of any videoto get the option to view itin VR mode.This is huge news for mobile VR as YouTube essentially just opened up what is likely the largest iOS virtual reality content library.Now, something to keep in mind is that this new functionality doesnt magically turnregular YouTube videos into360-degree content or anything, in Cardboard mode youre basically watching the video in theater mode.360 content looks awesome in Cardboard mode though and gives you the immersive360 experience that you cant get in magic window mode.As rumors continue to flurry around the Android VR headset that Google is reportedly launching this week, this release proves that whatever comes, the Cardboard platform is likely going to continue to be a major part of the companys future mobile VR strategy.
