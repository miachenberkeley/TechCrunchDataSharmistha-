 Bootstrapping Dutch startup Zami Life is aimingto engineer posture problemsout of the office workers lifewithan ergonomic stool that hasa curvedseat. The shape of the seatis designed to encourage the sitters spine to rest in what they claim is a healthier s-curve given theres no option for slouching on thisbackless, convex surface.Thats the first version of Zamisproduct, soft launched in the U.S. back in December. Butthe startup isnow taking thingsa stage further by crowdfunding (via Indiegogo) a new version of the stool, called Zami Smart, which includes sensors that track how long youve been sitting. And a companion app designed to prompt you to move more.We actually saw a hack at theDisrupt NY hackathon just this weekend, called Posture.io, that offered similar posture-tracking functionality but that was retrofitted to anexisting office chair. Zamis productsare a more expensive option starting at $299 for the basic model, or $379for the version with embedded sensors.So this is not acost-effective option for offices or individual consumers, but perhaps moreaesthetic  at least if you dig itsminimalist stool design. And dont work in an office with especially fancy chairs.Zamis founding team includesorthopedic surgeon Piete Van Loon and designerRuud-Jan Kokke.The new version of Zamisstool is designed to trackhow you sit via pressure sensors built into the legs, and it uses Bluetooth Low Energy to wirelessly offload data to acompanion app.The startup claims it can track posture, sitting periods and evenfine-grained detail about your behavior while seated  such as whether you fidget (should you feel the need to quantify that).The Zami uses four active pressure sensors, one in each leg.Your legs, when placed on the ground, take some of the weight and provide two additional support points. The sensors and the algorithm in the application can detect all this, itexplains.Combined with an initial short setup to determine a persons weight and other vital metrics, the Zami app uses the values of the sensors to detect all kinds of information.Among these is time spent sitting, quality of the sitting (your personal data and the weight distribution combined with original research data tells us in great detail about your posture, slouching, etc.), and behavior during sitting. (Lots of variation in the pressure sensors can indicate, for example, restless sitting or fidgeting, potential pressure point issues, etc).The app willalso keep track of how much you sit on other objects  or at least it will if you carry your phone with you in your pocket.On the motivational side, the Zami app will ping users who are slouching or who have been sitting for too long, encouraging you to get up and stretch your legs. It will also include suggestions for exercises to do with the Zami itself, such as this awesome yoga backbend:Zami says it plans to aggregate userssitting data in the cloud, allowingcomparisons with othersof similarweight, or perhaps age bracket.It says thisdata will be anonymized, but if you dont like the idea of a chair that informs how much of a couch potato you are, then this Internet-of-Things-device-in-the-making is not for you.The device is aprototype, with Zami targeting $30,000 in crowdfunding withtheir just launched campaign in order to get the seat to market  aiming for a December shipping schedule.
