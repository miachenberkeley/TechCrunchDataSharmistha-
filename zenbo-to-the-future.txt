ASUS is going big at Computex this year with the launch of new additions to ZenBook, Transformer and ZenFone lines. But the biggest new pieceto the companys unfortunately named Zenvolution puzzle is this bright-eyed little guy whos something along the lines of a cross between Wall-E and Sico, the robotic butler who had a fairly unsettling relationship with Adrians brother Paulie in Rocky IV.Nothing unwholesome here, of course. Zenbo (like ZenBook, only less OK) joined ASUS chairmanJonney Shih on stage during the companys Taipei presser for a quick cameo. The creepy cute little ET-headed robot got a lot more face time during a lengthy 11-minute ad that highlighted the robots many skills, set in a household thats taken up residence in the Uncanny Valley.Zenbos got a camera with facial recognition capable of making video calls and monitoring the home remotely, coupled with voice commands and vocal responses. It can play music and movies, provide reminders to take medication and head to appointments and help out with various online tasks like, you know, belt shopping. The little bot also has some educational capabilities built in and can help entertain your children when human companions wont do.This all appears to be pretty early stages. Zenbo doesnt have a release date, but Shih did announce that itll be selling for $599, a surprisingly affordable price for a little household companion that can both be your childs best friend and help you pick out the perfect belt.
