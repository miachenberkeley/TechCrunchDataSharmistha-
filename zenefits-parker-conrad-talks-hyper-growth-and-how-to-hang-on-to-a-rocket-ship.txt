Today at Disrupt SF 2015, ZenefitsParker Conrad joined our own Matthew Lynley on stage to dig into how the startup has managed to become one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.Zenefits is notable here in the TechCrunch house asit first launched its product at Disrupt NY in 2013 when it was afinalist in our Startup Battlefield.According to Conrad, Zenefits, now staffed by 1,600 people, has grownat a pace that he callsconsistent. How has the company managed that progress? Hechalked it up to something simple: [The] most important thing, he said, is to set really aggressive goals.According to the technology denizen, when the company set early revenue growth goals, its investors asked them why they were not aiming higher. In retrospect, given the companys growth, the anecdote is contentedlyironic.Growth, of course, is not always the easiest thing to manage for most companies. It becomes increasingly difficult when you expand as quickly as Zenefits. Conrad addressed the issue, saying thatthe only thing worse than growing quickly, he said, is not growing quickly.Zenefits also announced that itsproduct is now Affordable Care Act (ACA)-compliant. Given that the ACA, better known by the theoretical pejorative Obamacare, requires a fair amount of compliance work, the feature matters.According to Conrad, if you are a 75-person company, you dont have someone whose job it is to spend 15hours a month tracking this compliance [stuff].In a way, the ACA compliance news from Zenefits fits into its larger corporate push  make the work it takes to manage and care for your workers assimple as possible.Lynley pressedthe founder on how long-term its customers are, or will be. Will a firm that starts small and grows, age out of the Zenefits ecosystem? Conrad noted that most of its customers are between 50 and 1,000 employees, but that there is now a fundamental break point in its product at scale.The interview touched on the topic of payroll, which Conrad called a very important spoke. ZenPayroll, a different company, recently rebranded as Gusto and entered into Zenefits market space. Conrad declined to make news by announcing any new features.What will be interesting to see is how Zenefits manages to keep growing, while not losing its hunger.
