ZenHub, a service that helps engineering teams manage their GitHub projects through Trello-like drag-and-drop task boards, was previously only available for regular GitHub accounts. Starting now, however, enterprise users who use the on-premise GitHub Enterpriseservice, will also be able to use ZenHub.This new enterprise version of ZenHub is one of the first collaboration and project management service that integrates directly with GitHub Enterprise. Some of the companies that have already beta tested this new service include Imgur, ICON Health & Fitness and Japanese travel company Ikyu. Its hosted service is currently in use by groups at NBC, Facebook, Sony, Microsoft and others.ZenHub, which was funded by Axiom Zen, tells me that the idea here is to enableindustry heavyweights to centralize in GitHub, eliminating the need forthird-party project management tools by creating a single place of focus. The company argues that its service can save engineers about almost one and a half hours of work every day by helping them to make better use of GitHubs features.GitHub  and Git in general  is seeing rapid adoption in the enterprise. There are now a number of services on the market, including startups like waffle.io(which also works with GitHub Enterprise) and some of Microsofts and Atlassians tools, thatofferproject management services forGit. What makes ZenHub stands out is its direct integration with GitHub Enterprise, so that developers dont have to switch back and forth between even more different tools than they already do.
