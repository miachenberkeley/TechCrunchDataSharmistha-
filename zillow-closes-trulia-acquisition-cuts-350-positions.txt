As expected, Zillow today closed theacquisition of its competitor Truliain a stock-for-stock transaction. The total price of the acquisition was $2.5 billion. When Zillow first announced its intentions to take over Trulia, the stock price still valued the transaction at $3.5 billion.As is often the case when two very similar companies merge, Zillow and Trulia laid off 350 employees in San Francisco and Bellevue, Wash. This, Zillow says, was due primarily to redundancy in the combined companys sales and administrative organizations. 280 of these jobs have already been eliminated and another 70employees will be laid offby the end of the second quarter. All of them have already been notified. Together, Zillow and Trulia now have about 2,000 employees.Trulias CEO Paul Levine willnow be Trulias president and Peter Flint, Trulias co-founder and former CEO, is joining Zillows board of directors. The combined Zillow/Trulia will now operate under the name Zillow Group and start trading on Nasdaq tomorrow.Zillow says thatit plans to offer a shared services and marketing platform for advertisers later this year. For the time being, though, itlooks likeboth Zillow and Trulia will mostly continue to operate as before. That doesnt come as a major surprise. For the most part, thats how Zillow has approached most of its acquisitions. HotPads and StreetEasy, for example,are still getting regular updates, andeven thoughtheyve been integrated into Zillows organization, you can barely even find Zillows own branding on those sites.
