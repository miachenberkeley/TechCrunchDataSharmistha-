ZipMatch, an online property portal in the Philippines, is the latest startup in Southeast Asia to receive investment from Monks Hill Venturesand its $80 million fund.Theprominent VC firm led a $2.5 million Series A round, which includedparticipation from existing investor 500 Startups, that will go towards strengthening ZipMatchsdomestic business and expanding inSoutheast Asia.ZipMatch, which previously raised $1 million, covers both property sales and rentals. CEO and co-founder John Dang told TechCrunch in an interview that it aims to go beyond traditional listings bygiving visitors access to a variety of information and photosabout each property. To that end, the company dispatches employees to take 360 degree photos of buildingsand compile extensive reports on houses and condos.The company is also ambitious in its scope. It aims to capture information about every condominium building in a city so that renters dont miss out on a property.Dang said, though, it currentlysees more businesswith property sales than rentals at this point. ZipMatch covers both existing properties that are for sale, and pre-sales for new development. Unlike some that aim to disrupt the industry entirely, ZipMatchworkswith the incumbents.Real estate is still a very traditional process, he said, explaining that brokers and agencies are very muchneeded for paperwork and other reasons. We are empowering the professionals to do a better job  [through coaching and advice] we also incentivize them to behave properly with their customers.Existing classifieds use an advertising-basedmodel [that lets anyones listing stand above the others] and it just isnt very good. Frankly, real estate professionals arenot good at content, they are good at selling  we let them focus on that, Dangadded.Beyond just helping facilitate home buying and rentals, ZipMatch also matches users with property brokers and home loans. Dang said that makes it ideal for first-time buyers. The company generates revenuevia lead-generation for financial partners, andcharging asubscription to agents who list their details on the site. (That second part is an easy sell if ZipMatch already listsbuildings the agent is letting.)The ZipMatch CEO didnt provide specifics about the companys expansion plans, but he envisages that it could move intothree or four countries inSoutheast Asia over the next 18 months.That will be one expansion at a time though and it is currently analyzing opportunities.This Series A will also go expanding ZipMatchs coverage of the Philippines, Manila is nearly complete, Cebu andDavao are next on the list. The startup isalso furtherdeveloping its platformtoinclude more backend integrations for property industry professionals.99.co, a similar property site in Singapore run by serial entrepreneurs that share a similar ethos, raised $1.6 million in Januaryand spoke of its desire to expand across the region, perhaps using acquisition as one method.When I put it to Dang that ZipMatch would be a realistic target, said he was flattered but that company remainsfocused onmaking a difference in its home market.We wantto fix the [property sales and rental] problem here in the Philippines, he said. Were not thinking about anything elseuntil we feel like weve solved that.
