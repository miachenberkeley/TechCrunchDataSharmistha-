In June of last year, VC Experts discovered a filing that suggested ZocDoc, a roughly eight-year-old, New York-based online medical care schedule service, was raising a new round of funding worth $152 million and that valued the company at $1.6 billion.That round has closed with $130 million, at a current valuation of $1.8 billion, the company announced today. It wasledby Atomico and the Scottish investment firm Baillie Gifford(which is also a Spotify investor), with participation from previous backer Founders Fund.A spokesperson for the company says the round came together over the past few months.ZocDocs new funding makes it one of New Yorks most highly valued, privately held companies. It also puts it among theroughly 130 other privately held outfitsthat are currently valued at $1 billion or more, according to the real-time unicorn list of the firm CB Insights.Of course, it would also seem to push off an IPO, though ZocDocisnt discussing a timeline for thator sharing whether its profitable. It tells usinstead that every month is a record-setting month for us, in one capacity or another.ZocDoc, which isfree for patients but costs doctors $3,000 annually, has now raised $230 million altogether, including from earlier backers Khosla Ventures, DST Global, Goldman Sachs, SV Angel and prominent entrepreneurs Jeff Bezos and Marc Benioff.ZocDoccurrently has 600employees across three offices and millions ofcustomers, and offers its services across the U.S., covering 60 percent of the U.S. population, it says.Its foreign investors suggest a bigger push internationally is coming soon, too.
