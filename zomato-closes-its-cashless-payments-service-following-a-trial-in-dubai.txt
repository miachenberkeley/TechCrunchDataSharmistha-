Following up on a big round of layoffs earlier this week, Zomato said it is shutting down its cashless payments system  a featurethat it had trialled in the Middle East sincethe beginning of this year.The service, which allows customers to seamlessly pay for their food after adding their credit card  as the name indicates  had been trialled in Dubaisince February 2015. But, after looking at that test deploymentin more detail, Zomato has decidedit will be rolling back the service, and therefore not extending it to other markets worldwide, for a number of reasons.Writing in a blog post, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal explainedthe main reasons behind the move. Cashless payments didnt becomea part of the natural user flow, most of its users were early adopters, and the cost of educating restaurant staff to use it was too high versus the results, he said. Furthermore, since Zomato took the step of providing (paying for) iPads at each restaurant in order to process payments on the merchant side, thus it found thatthecustomer acquisition cost wastoo high.Speaking to TechCrunch last year, Zomato co-founder and COOPankaj Chaddah said payments was about moving up the value chain in the dining experience, and that it could have lead to loyal programs and other new revenue generating opportunities.Ultimately, though, the Dubai trial showed fundamentalissues.We had to lure the user to think differently - this was the most difficult part. In our Cashless product, we needed a user to think about the payment at a restaurant before the start of the meal, whereas they are accustomed to thinking about the payment only at the end of the meal, Goyal wrote on the company blog.Zomatos Cashless product offered its users a way to pay for a tab essentially as soon as sitting down at a table. There are a couple obvious advantages here: it gives restaurant goers a way to be able to pay for their check without having to wait for a waiter, and leave on their own schedule. But apparently the product was difficult enough to run that it wasnt quite ready for the market.TechCrunch reported on Friday that Zomato was laying off 300 of its employees, or about 10 percent of its workforce of 3,000.The cuts were a result of cutting costs in weaker parts of the companys business. The layoffswere described to TechCrunch as global and affecting all markets, but would be concentrated in regions where more staff members are focused on collecting content.Zomato has raised more than $223 million from investors to date and is valued at more than $1 billion. Its business isnt profitable, and it seems that these recent cuts and refocusingis aimed at remedying that and cutting down its burn rate.Goyal confirmed that the companywill realignthe teams working on Cashless to other businesses, rather than add to those aforementioned layoffs.Zomatoplans to bring Cashless back to Dubai  and potentially other markets  in tine, once we have the ecosystem in place to counter the above challenges, the companysaid in a statement. If it gets a great enough penetration, it wont have to install any additional hardware at a restaurant, Goyalfurther explained in the blog post.Wed like to say a big thank-you to everyone involved in this first chapter of Zomato Cashless, heconcluded. We are confident that Cashless 2.0 will be a stronger, more sustainable product and business, and one were looking forward to rolling out.Zomato initially made its name as a food discovery network akin to aYelp for restaurants in India. It has expanded globally and branched out from that basic service by offering cashless payments and food delivery in its native India, ithasa whitelabel service for restaurants, and there are plans to introduce a table booking service, too. The company raised $50 million in August with the goal of expanding its new business verticals into more markets  while it is preparing to bring its food delivery service and table ordering to new countries,cashless payments is one area where it is pulling back for now.
