Mobile collaboration app Zula, co-founded by noted investor Jeff Pulver in 2013, won the Audience award at TC Disrupt a few years ago, and a seed round From Microsoft Ventures. From there things didnt quite pan out, and now the company has pivoted into a new product that aims to make podcasting accessible to the masses.ZCast claims to allow anyone to produce a high quality multi-member podcast from mobile or web, real-time commenting. Its been in closed beta for the past few months, and is now available on the Apple App Store or web here.Normal podcasting can be something of a faff to use a technical term. ZCast was launched to make it cheaper, and improve distribution, they say. Admittedly that sounds like Audioboom and numerous others.With ZCast you initiate a live, on-air, conversation and by leveraging Twitter users are able to invite others to join the conversation as a ZCast Co-Host or just to listen.Lets hope they are luckier this time around. Odeo anyone?
