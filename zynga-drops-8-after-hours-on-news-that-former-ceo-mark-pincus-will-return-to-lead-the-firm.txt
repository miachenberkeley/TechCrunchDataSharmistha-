Now-priorCEO Don Mattrick is out of twochairs: The one atop the companys leadership structure andhis seat on the board.The companys shares fellmore than 10 percent in the wake of the news, but have since recovered to a more modest negative 8 percent. Investors do not appear wildly enthused about the change, perhaps for no other reason than the fact that leadership transitions are often sufficientsmoke to call fire.Zynga has been improving from a financial perspective for some time. The company recently reported several quarters of revenue growth, and narrowing losses on both dollar and per-share terms. Zynga remains well-capitalized.In a statement, Pincus noted that under Mattricks leadership, the company grew its mobile bookings to 60 percent of revenue from 27 percent when the joined. Zynga is infamous for being slow to transition from Facebooks platformto the mobile gaming revolution that we continue to experience as an industry.Before the news was announced, Zynga was worth $2.57 billion. Presuming a 10 percent loss on the news, Zyngas value will remain comfortably over the $2 billion mark.The news came as a surprise. The installation of Mattrick as leader after he didnt win CEO Bingo at Microsoft wasnt wildly shocking. That the executive would depart this quickly ismore notable.A source familiar with Mattricks time at Microsoft told TechCrunch that the executive was intelligent and well-liked. It isnt clear what precipitated the change.For now, Zynga has its old leader back to directthe company out of the cold.
